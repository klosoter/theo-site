# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of the **hypostatic union** affirms the inseparable union of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**. He emphasizes the **distinctness of the natures** without confusion or division, upholding the full reality of both natures for the sake of **redemption** and **mediation**. Calvin’s articulation is deeply rooted in **Chalcedonian Christology**, yet shaped by his own exegetical and pastoral concerns.

- "For we affirm that Christ is indeed God and man, but so that neither his divinity is separated from his humanity, nor his humanity from his divinity." (Institutes II.xiv.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book II, chapters xii–xiv)
- Commentary on the Gospel According to John
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Sermons on the Deity of Christ
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - Christ is one **person** in whom both **divine and human natures** subsist.
    - The union is personal, not merely moral or accidental.
    - There is no mixture or confusion of the two natures.
    - The person of the Son is the subject of all Christ’s actions and experiences.
    - "We confess that Christ, in his flesh, is the same Son of God, and that the Word was made flesh, not by the conversion of the Word into flesh, but by the assumption of the human nature into unity with the Word." (Institutes II.xiv.2)

2. **Distinction of the Natures**
    - The **divine nature** remains fully divine, and the **human nature** remains fully human.
    - Each nature retains its own properties and functions.
    - The natures are united without being blended or absorbed into each other.
    - The distinction is necessary for Christ to be both true God and true man.
    - "For we do not imagine a Christ who is God and man confusedly in one person, but we affirm that he is truly God and truly man, preserving the properties of each nature unimpaired." (Institutes II.xiv.4)

3. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Properties)**
    - The properties of each nature are attributed to the one person of Christ.
    - Calvin rejects any transfer of properties from one nature to the other.
    - The person acts according to either nature, but the natures themselves are not intermingled.
    - This safeguards both the reality of Christ’s suffering and the efficacy of his divine work.
    - "We do not separate the natures, but distinguish them, so that the properties of each remain entire, and yet the whole work is referred to the single person." (Institutes II.xiv.2)

4. **Necessity for Redemption**
    - The hypostatic union is essential for Christ to be the **mediator** between God and humanity.
    - Only one who is both God and man can accomplish **atonement** and reconciliation.
    - Christ’s obedience and suffering have saving efficacy because of his unique person.
    - The union undergirds the sufficiency and perfection of Christ’s priestly work.
    - "Unless the divinity had been united with the humanity, it would have been impossible for Christ to bear the weight of God’s wrath and to conquer death." (Institutes II.xii.3)

5. **Rejection of Eutychianism and Nestorianism**
    - Calvin explicitly rejects any confusion (Eutychianism) or separation (Nestorianism) of the natures.
    - He upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** as a faithful summary of biblical teaching.
    - The union is neither a blending nor a mere association of two persons.
    - This protects the integrity of both Christ’s deity and humanity in the work of salvation.
    - "We must beware of imagining such a union as would destroy the distinction of the two natures, or such a distinction as would divide the unity of the person." (Institutes II.xiv.4)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s formulation of the **hypostatic union** has profoundly shaped **Reformed Christology**, providing a careful balance between the unity and distinction of Christ’s natures. His emphasis on the union’s necessity for **redemption** and **mediation** has influenced confessional documents such as the Westminster Standards. Calvin’s clarity and fidelity to the **Chalcedonian** tradition continue to inform theological reflection and pastoral teaching on the person of Christ within the Reformed tradition.
