# Cyril of Alexandria (c. 376–444)

Cyril of Alexandria was a central figure in the Christological controversies of the fifth century, most notably defending the **hypostatic union**—the doctrine that in the one **Person** of Jesus Christ, **divine** and **human natures** are united without confusion, change, division, or separation. He opposed **Nestorianism** by insisting on the unity of Christ's person, emphasizing that the **Logos** truly became incarnate and that Mary is rightly called **Theotokos**.

- "For we do not say that the nature of the Word was changed and became flesh, nor again that it was transformed into a whole man consisting of soul and body, but rather that the Word, by uniting to Himself in His own Person flesh animated by a rational soul, inexplicably and incomprehensibly became man." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Person**
    - Christ is one **Person** (hypostasis), not two.
    - The divine and human natures are united in the one **incarnate Logos**.
    - This union is real and personal, not merely moral or associative.
    - The title **Theotokos** for Mary safeguards the unity of Christ’s person.
    - "We do not divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two Sons."

2. **Distinctness of Natures**
    - The **divine** and **human natures** remain distinct within the union.
    - Each nature retains its own properties and operations.
    - The union does not result in a mixture or confusion of natures.
    - The distinction is maintained even as the natures are inseparably joined.
    - "We say that the natures are united, but we do not confuse them."

3. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Properties)**
    - The properties of both natures are truly predicated of the one Person.
    - The **Logos** can be said to suffer and die according to the human nature.
    - Divine actions are performed by the same Christ who is truly human.
    - This communication is grounded in the hypostatic union, not in a mingling of natures.
    - "The Word suffered in the flesh, not in the nature of the Godhead."

4. **Rejection of Nestorianism**
    - Nestorius’s teaching of two persons in Christ is condemned.
    - The separation of the natures into two subjects undermines redemption.
    - The unity of Christ is necessary for the efficacy of salvation.
    - The **Council of Ephesus** affirmed Cyril’s Christology against Nestorius.
    - "It is not right to divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two Sons."

5. **Soteriological Significance of the Union**
    - Only the true union of God and man in Christ brings salvation.
    - The **incarnation** is the means by which the divine Son redeems humanity.
    - The hypostatic union ensures that Christ’s actions are truly those of the God-man.
    - The union is essential for the mediation and restoration of fallen humanity.
    - "He who was by nature God became man, and did not lose what He was, but continued to be what He was, even as He assumed what He was not."

## Legacy and Impact

Cyril’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** became foundational for orthodox Christology, shaping the definitions of the **Council of Ephesus** and later the **Council of Chalcedon**. His insistence on the unity of Christ’s person and the reality of the incarnation decisively influenced both Eastern and Western Christian theology. The terms and categories he developed remain central to discussions of the person of Christ, and his polemic against **Nestorianism** set enduring boundaries for Christian confession.
