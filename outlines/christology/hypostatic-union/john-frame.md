# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **hypostatic union** through his distinctive **multiperspectivalism**, emphasizing the unity and distinction of **Christ’s divine and human natures** within one **person**. He upholds the classic **Chalcedonian Definition** while integrating it into a broader **Reformed doctrine of Christ** that stresses the practical implications for **revelation, redemption, and worship**.

- "Jesus is both God and man, two natures in one person, without confusion, change, division, or separation." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Word of God
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Definition**
    - Upholds the classic formula: Christ is one person in two natures, fully God and fully man.
    - Rejects both **Nestorianism** (division of persons) and **Eutychianism** (confusion of natures).
    - Sees Chalcedon as a faithful summary of biblical teaching.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of both natures for Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "The Chalcedonian formula is the best summary of the biblical teaching about Christ’s person." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Multiperspectival Approach to Christology**
    - Applies his triperspectival method (normative, situational, existential) to the person of Christ.
    - Argues that understanding Christ’s person requires multiple perspectives: biblical, historical, and practical.
    - Sees the hypostatic union as a mystery best approached through complementary perspectives.
    - Uses this approach to clarify misunderstandings and avoid reductionism.
    - "We need to approach the doctrine of Christ from several perspectives to appreciate its fullness." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - Stresses that the two natures are united in the one person of the Son.
    - Rejects any division or separation between the divine and human in Christ.
    - Emphasizes that all actions of Christ are actions of the one person.
    - Maintains that the unity is essential for Christ’s role as mediator.
    - "The one person of Christ acts through both natures, never as two separate agents." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Distinction Without Separation of Natures**
    - Affirms that the divine and human natures remain distinct, not mixed or confused.
    - Each nature retains its own attributes and properties.
    - The distinction safeguards the reality of both Christ’s deity and humanity.
    - This distinction is vital for understanding Christ’s temptations, suffering, and obedience.
    - "The two natures are united in one person, but each retains its own properties." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Practical and Redemptive Significance**
    - The hypostatic union is foundational for Christ’s work of atonement.
    - It grounds the believer’s assurance in the sufficiency of Christ’s mediation.
    - Shapes Christian worship and devotion to the person of Christ.
    - Informs the believer’s union with Christ and participation in his benefits.
    - "Only one who is both God and man can bring God and man together in salvation." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s treatment of the **hypostatic union** is marked by clarity, fidelity to historic orthodoxy, and a unique **multiperspectival** framework. His work has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by integrating classic Christological formulations with practical and epistemological concerns. Frame’s approach encourages theologians and pastors to engage the doctrine not only as a matter of confession but as central to Christian life and ministry. His emphasis on the unity and distinction in Christ continues to shape discussions on the person and work of Jesus in evangelical circles.
