# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of the **hypostatic union** affirms the inseparable union of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**. He emphasized the real, personal union without confusion or division, grounding the believer’s salvation and the efficacy of the **atonement** in this mystery. Luther’s distinctive approach, especially his teaching on the **communication of attributes** (communicatio idiomatum), shaped Lutheran Christology and distinguished it from both medieval scholasticism and Reformed perspectives.

- "He who is true God, born of the Father from eternity, is also true man, born of the Virgin Mary; and these two natures are so united in one Person that they are not separated from each other." (Large Catechism)

## Key Works

- The Large Catechism (1529)
- The Smalcald Articles (1537)
- Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper (1528)
- Sermons on John (various)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 37: Word and Sacrament III

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **True Union of Two Natures**
    - Christ possesses both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
    - These natures are united in one **person** (hypostasis) without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - The union is real and personal, not merely moral or associative.
    - The unity is essential for the work of **redemption**.
    - "The two natures are so united in one Person that they are not separated from each other." (Large Catechism)

2. **Communication of Attributes (Communicatio Idiomatum)**
    - The properties of both natures are truly communicated to the one person of Christ.
    - Luther taught that the human nature shares in the attributes of the divine through the personal union.
    - This undergirds his teaching on the real presence in the **Lord’s Supper**.
    - The communication is not a mixture but a sharing grounded in the hypostatic union.
    - "Wherever you place Christ, there you must also place his humanity." (Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper)

3. **Rejection of Nestorianism and Eutychianism**
    - Luther rejected any division of Christ into two persons (Nestorianism).
    - He also denied any confusion or absorption of natures (Eutychianism).
    - The union maintains the integrity of both natures.
    - The person of Christ is the subject of all actions and sufferings.
    - "We do not make two Christs, one divine and one human, as Nestorius does." (Smalcald Articles)

4. **Soteriological Necessity of the Union**
    - The hypostatic union is essential for Christ to be the true **mediator** and redeemer.
    - Only one who is both God and man can accomplish salvation.
    - The union ensures the efficacy of Christ’s obedience, suffering, and death.
    - The believer’s assurance rests on the real union of natures in Christ.
    - "If Christ is not true God and true man, what help is it to me?" (Large Catechism)

5. **Implications for Sacramental Theology**
    - The hypostatic union grounds Luther’s doctrine of the **real presence** in the Eucharist.
    - Christ’s body and blood are truly present because of the communication of attributes.
    - The union enables Christ’s humanity to be present in multiple places.
    - This sets Lutheran sacramental theology apart from Reformed and Roman Catholic views.
    - "His body can be in many places at once, because it is united with the divine nature." (Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** profoundly shaped Lutheran Christology and sacramental theology, especially through his robust doctrine of the **communication of attributes**. His teaching provided a foundation for Lutheran confessional documents and distinguished Lutheranism from both Reformed and Roman Catholic traditions. Luther’s emphasis on the real, personal union of natures in Christ continues to influence ecumenical dialogues and remains a central feature of classical Protestant theology.
