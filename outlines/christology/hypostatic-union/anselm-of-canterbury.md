# Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109)

Anselm of Canterbury articulated a robust doctrine of the **hypostatic union**, affirming that in the one **person of Christ** subsist both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**. He maintained that this union was necessary for the **atonement**, as only one who is both fully God and fully man could mediate between God and humanity and offer a sufficient satisfaction for sin.

- "It is necessary that the selfsame Person who is to make this satisfaction be perfect God and perfect man." (Cur Deus Homo)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Natures, One Person**
    - Christ possesses both a true **divine nature** and a true **human nature**.
    - These two natures are united in the one **hypostasis** (person) of the Son.
    - The union does not result in confusion or mixture of the natures.
    - Each nature retains its own properties within the unity of the person.
    - "For God was not to lose his divinity, nor man his humanity." (Cur Deus Homo)

2. **Necessity of the Hypostatic Union for Atonement**
    - Only one who is both God and man can offer a satisfaction sufficient for human sin.
    - The **God-man** acts as the unique mediator between God and humanity.
    - The divine nature provides infinite worth; the human nature provides true representation.
    - The union enables Christ to offer a sacrifice that is both fitting and effective.
    - "None but one who is God-man can make the satisfaction by which man is saved." (Cur Deus Homo)

3. **Integrity of Christ’s Humanity**
    - Christ’s human nature is complete, including a rational soul and true body.
    - The humanity of Christ is not diminished or absorbed by the divinity.
    - Christ’s obedience and suffering are truly human acts.
    - The reality of Christ’s humanity is essential for his role as substitute.
    - "He ought to have a human will, since he ought to be a true man." (Cur Deus Homo)

4. **Impeccability and Sinlessness of Christ**
    - Christ’s human nature is without sin, both original and actual.
    - The hypostatic union does not compromise Christ’s moral perfection.
    - Sinlessness is necessary for Christ to offer a perfect satisfaction.
    - The divine person guarantees the moral integrity of the human nature.
    - "He was not under obligation to die, since he had no sin." (Cur Deus Homo)

5. **Communication of Attributes**
    - The properties of both natures are predicated of the one person.
    - Actions and experiences of Christ are attributed to the person, not to the natures separately.
    - The union allows for statements such as "God suffered" without confusion of natures.
    - The communication is according to the person, not a blending of divine and human properties.
    - "The same one is both God who created man and man who was created by God." (Cur Deus Homo)

## Legacy and Impact

Anselm’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** profoundly shaped medieval and later **Christological** thought, providing a rational and theological foundation for understanding the person of Christ. His insistence on the necessity of the union for the work of **atonement** influenced both scholastic and Reformed theologians. Anselm’s careful distinctions regarding the natures and person of Christ remain a touchstone for orthodox Christology and continue to inform contemporary discussions on the incarnation.
