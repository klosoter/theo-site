# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a robust doctrine of the **hypostatic union**, affirming that in the one **Person** of Christ, the **divine** and **human natures** are united without confusion, change, division, or separation. He employed the categories of **substance**, **nature**, and **person** to clarify how the **Word** assumed a complete human nature, insisting on the integrity of both natures within the unity of the **Second Person of the Trinity**.

- "It must be said that in Christ there is only one hypostasis, and that a divine one." (Summa Theologiae III, q.2, a.3)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, Part III (Questions 1–59)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book III
- De Veritate, Question 29
- De Unione Verbi Incarnati

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Person in Christ**
    - Christ is one **Person** (hypostasis), not two.
    - The divine **Word** subsists in two natures, divine and human.
    - The union occurs in the Person, not in the nature.
    - The human nature does not constitute a separate person.
    - "The union took place in the Person, so that the same Person is both God and man." (Summa Theologiae III, q.2, a.6)

2. **Integrity of Both Natures**
    - Both **divine** and **human natures** remain complete and unconfused.
    - The human nature includes a true body and rational soul.
    - The divine nature is not diminished or altered by the union.
    - Each nature retains its own operations and properties.
    - "Nothing of the reality of either nature is removed through this union." (Summa Theologiae III, q.2, a.1)

3. **Communication of Idioms**
    - Properties of each nature are predicated of the one Person.
    - The subject of all actions and sufferings is the Person of the **Word**.
    - Divine and human attributes are truly ascribed to Christ.
    - The distinction of natures is preserved in all predications.
    - "Whatever belongs to either nature can be predicated of the Person." (Summa Theologiae III, q.16, a.4)

4. **Mode of Union: Assumption, Not Change**
    - The **Word** assumes human nature, not vice versa.
    - The divine nature is the active principle in the union.
    - The union is not by mixture or confusion, but by assumption.
    - The human nature is united to the Word from the first moment of conception.
    - "The union of the Word with flesh is by assumption, not by confusion." (Summa Theologiae III, q.3, a.1)

5. **Rejection of Nestorianism and Eutychianism**
    - Denies that Christ is two persons (against **Nestorianism**).
    - Denies that the natures are mingled into a third (against **Eutychianism**).
    - Affirms the **Chalcedonian Definition** as authoritative.
    - Maintains the distinction and integrity of both natures in the one Person.
    - "There is neither confusion of natures nor division of Person in Christ." (Summa Theologiae III, q.2, a.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of the **hypostatic union** became foundational for later Roman Catholic and much of Western Christian theology, providing conceptual clarity through his use of Aristotelian categories. His careful distinctions influenced the **Council of Trent** and subsequent scholastic theology, shaping debates on Christology for centuries. Aquinas’s synthesis of **Chalcedonian orthodoxy** with philosophical rigor continues to inform contemporary discussions on the person and work of Christ.
