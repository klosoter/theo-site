# Leo the Great (c. 400–461)

Leo the Great articulated a definitive doctrine of the **hypostatic union**, affirming that in the one **Person of Christ** the **divine** and **human natures** are united without confusion, change, division, or separation. His Christology, especially as expressed in the **Tome of Leo**, became foundational for orthodox teaching at the **Council of Chalcedon**, safeguarding both the full **divinity** and full **humanity** of Christ.

- "Each nature performs its proper functions in communion with the other: the Word does what is proper to the Word, and the flesh fulfills what is proper to the flesh." (Tome of Leo)

## Key Works

- Sermons (Sermones)
- Letters (Epistolae)

- Leo the Great: Selected Letters (trans. and ed. by Carolinne White)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Natures, One Person**
    - Christ exists as one **Person** with both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
    - The natures are united in the one **hypostasis** of the Son.
    - There is no mingling or confusion between the natures.
    - Each nature retains its own properties and operations.
    - "For each form does what is proper to it with the cooperation of the other." (Tome of Leo)

2. **Impassibility of the Divine Nature**
    - The **divine nature** of Christ cannot suffer or change.
    - Suffering and human experiences are attributed to the **human nature** alone.
    - The distinction preserves the transcendence and immutability of the **Logos**.
    - The unity of person ensures that the subject of suffering is the one Christ.
    - "The impassible God did not disdain to be passible man." (Sermon 28)

3. **Full Humanity of Christ**
    - Christ assumed a true and complete **human nature** from the Virgin Mary.
    - The human nature includes a rational soul and body.
    - Christ’s humanity is consubstantial with us, apart from sin.
    - The reality of Christ’s humanity is essential for redemption.
    - "He took the form of a servant without stain of sin, enlarging our humanity but not diminishing His divinity." (Tome of Leo)

4. **Full Divinity of Christ**
    - Christ is eternally begotten of the Father, true **God** from true God.
    - The **divine nature** is uncreated, omnipotent, and coequal with the Father.
    - The incarnation does not diminish or alter the divinity of the Son.
    - The divine nature acts in harmony with the human nature in the one Person.
    - "The lowliness of man was assumed by the majesty of God." (Tome of Leo)

5. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Properties)**
    - The attributes of both natures are predicated of the one **Person** of Christ.
    - Actions and experiences are ascribed to the Person, not to the natures in abstraction.
    - The unity of Person allows for statements like "God suffered" with proper qualification.
    - This principle guards against both **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors.
    - "Each nature acts in communion with the other, yet what is proper to each is preserved." (Tome of Leo)

## Legacy and Impact

Leo the Great’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** was decisive for the Christological settlement at the **Council of Chalcedon** (451), shaping orthodox doctrine for both East and West. His insistence on the integrity of both **divine** and **human natures** in the one Person of Christ became a touchstone for later theological reflection and confessional standards. Leo’s legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of Chalcedonian Christology as the benchmark of Christian orthodoxy.
