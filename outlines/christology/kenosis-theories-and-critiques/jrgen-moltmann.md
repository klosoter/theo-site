# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann’s theology of **kenosis** emphasizes the self-emptying of God in the **incarnation** and **crucifixion** as the supreme revelation of divine love and solidarity with human suffering. He challenges the classical doctrine of **impassibility**, insisting that the **Trinitarian God** truly suffers and empties himself in Christ, redefining divine power as vulnerable, self-giving love.

- "God does not become God by excluding what is not God, but by emptying himself and taking upon himself the form of a servant." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- Jesus Christ for Today’s World (1994)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- "Kenosis in the Christian Experience" (in The Work of Love: Creation as Kenosis, 2001)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Kenosis as Trinitarian Event**
    - Kenosis involves the **whole Trinity** in the event of the cross.
    - The Father suffers the loss of the Son, and the Spirit unites them in love.
    - Mutual self-giving is intrinsic to the **Trinitarian life**.
    - Divine self-emptying is the deepest expression of God’s love.
    - "The cross is the open Trinity, and kenosis is the eternal movement of love in God himself." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

2. **Critique of Classical Impassibility**
    - Moltmann rejects the idea that God is **impassible** and unaffected by creation.
    - He argues that true love requires the capacity to suffer with and for others.
    - The cross demonstrates that God is vulnerable and open to the world.
    - Divine suffering is not a deficiency but the perfection of love.
    - "A God who cannot suffer cannot love either." (The Crucified God)

3. **Kenosis as Revelation of Divine Power**
    - Divine power is redefined as **self-giving** rather than domination.
    - The incarnation and crucifixion reveal God’s power in weakness.
    - Kenosis is not the suspension of divinity but its fullest expression.
    - God’s sovereignty is manifest in his willingness to be affected by creation.
    - "God’s power is revealed in the powerlessness of the cross." (The Crucified God)

4. **Kenosis and Human Suffering**
    - God’s self-emptying is the foundation for **solidarity with the suffering**.
    - The cross is the assurance that God is present in human pain and abandonment.
    - Kenosis calls the church to participate in the suffering of others.
    - Hope arises from God’s identification with the oppressed and forsaken.
    - "Only a suffering God can help." (The Crucified God)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment of Kenosis**
    - Kenosis is not merely historical but points to the **future consummation**.
    - The resurrection is the vindication of self-giving love.
    - The final redemption will reveal the fullness of God’s self-emptying for creation.
    - Eschatology is grounded in the hope of God’s ultimate solidarity and renewal.
    - "The future of God is the future of his self-giving love." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s kenotic theology has profoundly influenced contemporary discussions on **divine suffering**, the **Trinity**, and the meaning of power in Christian thought. His critique of impassibility and emphasis on God’s solidarity with the suffering have shaped liberation, feminist, and political theologies. By reframing **kenosis** as the heart of divine love, Moltmann has challenged traditional doctrines and inspired new approaches to Christology and the doctrine of God. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a theology of hope rooted in the cross.
