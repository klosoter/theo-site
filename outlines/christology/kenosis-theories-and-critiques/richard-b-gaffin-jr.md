# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a staunch critic of **kenosis theories**, which propose that Christ emptied himself of certain divine attributes in the **incarnation**. Gaffin upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** and insists on the full and continued possession of both **divine and human natures** in the person of Christ, emphasizing the inseparability of Christ’s deity and humanity throughout his earthly ministry.

- "The so-called kenotic theories of the incarnation are at odds with the biblical and confessional witness to the unabridged deity of the incarnate Son." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "The Incarnation" in The New Dictionary of Theology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Holy Spirit and the Resurrection of Christ" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "A Cessationist View" in Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Christology**
    - Christ is one person in two distinct, unconfused natures: fully God and fully man.
    - The **divine attributes** are never surrendered or diminished in the incarnation.
    - The unity of Christ’s person is maintained without mixture or division of natures.
    - Any theory that posits a reduction of Christ’s deity undermines orthodox Christology.
    - "The Chalcedonian formula remains the indispensable boundary for any faithful doctrine of the incarnation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Rejection of Ontological Kenosis**
    - Kenosis theories that suggest the Son relinquished divine attributes are fundamentally flawed.
    - Gaffin argues that such views compromise the immutability and aseity of God.
    - The incarnation involves addition (assumption of humanity), not subtraction (loss of deity).
    - The Son’s self-emptying is functional and redemptive, not ontological.
    - "Kenosis, rightly understood, refers to Christ’s humility in taking on flesh, not to any loss of deity." (The New Dictionary of Theology)

3. **Functional, Not Essential, Self-Emptying**
    - Christ’s **kenosis** is best understood as a voluntary acceptance of the limitations of human existence.
    - The Son’s divine prerogatives are exercised in accordance with the Father’s will, not abandoned.
    - The humiliation of Christ is a matter of status and function, not essence.
    - The incarnation is an act of addition, not subtraction, to the Son’s person.
    - "The self-emptying of Philippians 2 is an act of addition, not subtraction." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Scriptural and Confessional Fidelity**
    - Gaffin grounds his critique of kenosis in the exegesis of key biblical texts, especially Philippians 2.
    - He aligns his position with the **Westminster Standards** and the broader Reformed tradition.
    - The integrity of Christ’s person and work depends on maintaining both natures in full.
    - Any deviation from confessional Christology leads to doctrinal instability.
    - "The Reformed confessions leave no room for a kenotic reduction of Christ’s deity." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - The incarnation and Christ’s self-emptying must be understood within the context of redemptive history.
    - Christ’s humiliation is essential for his mediatorial work and resurrection.
    - The resurrection vindicates the full deity and humanity of Christ, countering kenotic interpretations.
    - The work of the **Holy Spirit** in Christ’s life demonstrates the ongoing union of both natures.
    - "The resurrection is the decisive demonstration that the incarnate Son never ceased to be fully God." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust defense of **orthodox Christology** has shaped contemporary Reformed responses to kenosis theories, reinforcing the boundaries set by the **Chalcedonian Definition**. His insistence on the inseparability of Christ’s divine and human natures has influenced generations of pastors and theologians, particularly within the Westminster tradition. Gaffin’s work continues to serve as a bulwark against modern attempts to dilute the doctrine of the incarnation.
