# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos critiqued **kenosis theories** as incompatible with classical **Christology** and the **immutability** of the divine nature. He upheld the **Chalcedonian Definition**, insisting that the **incarnation** involved the addition of a human nature to the eternal Son, not the subtraction or limitation of divine attributes.

- "The kenosis theory, in its various forms, does violence to the true conception of the incarnation as set forth in Scripture and the creeds." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Christology
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- "The Pauline Conception of Christ" (Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Immutability Maintained**
    - God’s **attributes** cannot be surrendered or diminished in the incarnation.
    - The Son remains fully **divine** while assuming a human nature.
    - Any theory implying change in the divine essence is rejected.
    - The **immutability** of God is foundational for Vos’s critique of kenosis.
    - "The divine nature cannot be subject to change, nor can it be emptied of its essential attributes." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Chalcedonian Christology Affirmed**
    - Christ is one person in two natures, **without confusion or change**.
    - The union is hypostatic, not a fusion or mixture.
    - Kenosis theories undermine the integrity of the **Chalcedonian Definition**.
    - The incarnation is addition, not subtraction, of nature.
    - "The Chalcedonian formula guards against all forms of kenotic Christology." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Scriptural Authority in Christology**
    - Vos grounds Christological doctrine in **biblical revelation**.
    - He critiques speculative theories not rooted in exegesis.
    - Kenosis is seen as a misreading of Philippians 2:7.
    - The **self-emptying** of Christ refers to his humility, not loss of deity.
    - "Scripture does not teach a real divestiture of divine attributes." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Rejection of Functional Kenosis**
    - Even functional limitations (e.g., knowledge, power) are explained by the human nature, not by loss in the divine.
    - Christ’s **kenosis** is a matter of status and role, not ontology.
    - The Son’s voluntary submission does not entail ontological change.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** safeguards the distinction of natures.
    - "The humiliation of Christ is ethical and economic, not metaphysical." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - The incarnation is interpreted within the framework of **redemptive history**.
    - Christ’s self-emptying is part of his mediatorial work.
    - The focus is on Christ’s obedience and suffering, not metaphysical change.
    - The **work of redemption** requires the full deity and humanity of Christ.
    - "Redemptive history demands a Savior who is both fully God and fully man." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s critique of **kenosis theories** reinforced the Reformed commitment to classical **Christology** and the immutability of God. His careful exegesis and theological method shaped later Reformed responses to modern Christological trends. By emphasizing the integrity of both natures in Christ, Vos provided a robust framework for defending orthodox doctrine against kenotic reinterpretations. His work remains influential in contemporary discussions of the person and work of Christ.
