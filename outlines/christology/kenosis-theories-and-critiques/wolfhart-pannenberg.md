# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg engaged **kenosis theories** critically, emphasizing the importance of **Christ’s divinity and humanity** within the framework of **Trinitarian theology** and **eschatological revelation**. He rejected classical kenoticism’s tendency to diminish the **immutability** and **full deity** of Christ, instead advocating for a dynamic understanding of **incarnation** that preserves both natures without confusion or division.

- "The kenotic theory is not compatible with the unity of the divine essence and the trinitarian relations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Jesus—God and Man
- Revelation as History
- The Idea of God and Human Freedom
- Anthropology in Theological Perspective

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Classical Kenoticism**
    - Argues that traditional kenosis theories compromise the **immutability** and **impassibility** of God.
    - Maintains that Christ’s **divine attributes** are not surrendered or diminished in the incarnation.
    - Sees kenoticism as undermining the **unity of the Trinity**.
    - Insists that the **Logos** remains fully divine even in the state of humiliation.
    - "The kenotic theory is not compatible with the unity of the divine essence and the trinitarian relations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Incarnation as Eschatological Event**
    - Views the **incarnation** as the anticipation of the eschatological self-revelation of God.
    - Emphasizes that Christ’s humanity and divinity are revealed in the context of **God’s future**.
    - Argues that the **self-emptying** of Christ is not a loss of deity but a mode of revelation.
    - Connects the meaning of kenosis to the **eschatological consummation** of history.
    - "The incarnation is the anticipation of the eschatological revelation of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Trinitarian Framework**
    - Grounds Christology within the **relations of the Trinity** rather than in metaphysical speculation.
    - Asserts that the Son’s self-humbling is an expression of **intra-Trinitarian love**.
    - Rejects any notion that the Son ceases to possess divine attributes.
    - Stresses the **perichoretic unity** of Father, Son, and Spirit throughout the incarnation.
    - "The unity of the divine essence is inseparable from the trinitarian relations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Historical Revelation of Christ’s Person**
    - Christ’s identity is revealed through the **historical process** culminating in resurrection.
    - The **self-emptying** is understood as a historical event, not an ontological change in the divine nature.
    - The meaning of kenosis is discerned in the **history of Jesus** and his obedience.
    - Revelation is always tied to **God’s action in history**, not abstract metaphysics.
    - "The revelation of Jesus’ divinity occurs in the history of his obedience and exaltation." (Jesus—God and Man)

5. **Critique of Metaphysical Speculation**
    - Warns against speculative attempts to define how the divine and human natures relate in Christ.
    - Prefers a **historical and relational** approach to the doctrine of Christ.
    - Argues that kenosis theories often rely on problematic metaphysical assumptions.
    - Emphasizes the **event-character** of revelation over static ontological categories.
    - "Christology must avoid speculative metaphysics and remain grounded in the history of Jesus." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s critique of **kenosis theories** has shaped modern discussions of **Christology**, especially in relation to the **Trinity** and the doctrine of **revelation**. His insistence on the unity of Christ’s person and the eschatological context of incarnation has influenced both systematic and historical theologians. By grounding the debate in **Trinitarian relations** and historical revelation, Pannenberg provided a robust alternative to both classical kenoticism and static metaphysical models. His work continues to inform contemporary theology’s engagement with the mystery of the incarnation.
