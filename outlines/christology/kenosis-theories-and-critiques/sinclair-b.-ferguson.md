# Sinclair Ferguson (1948–)

Sinclair Ferguson approaches **kenosis theories** with a strong commitment to **classical Christology** and the **Chalcedonian Definition**, emphasizing the full and unaltered **divinity and humanity of Christ**. He critiques kenotic models that suggest the Son relinquished or limited divine attributes, arguing instead for the **immutability** and **inseparable operations** of the Trinity in the incarnation.

- "The incarnation did not involve the subtraction of deity but the addition of humanity." (The Holy Spirit)

## Key Works

- The Holy Spirit (1996)
- The Whole Christ (2016)
- In Christ Alone: Living the Gospel Centered Life (2007)
- "The Incarnation" in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson & David Wright)
- Some Pastors and Teachers (2017)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Upholding the Chalcedonian Definition**
    - Affirms Christ as fully God and fully man, without confusion or change.
    - Rejects any notion that the Son divested Himself of divine attributes.
    - Sees **kenosis** as a misreading of Philippians 2.
    - Stresses the unity of Christ’s person in two natures.
    - "The Chalcedonian formula remains the essential safeguard against Christological error." (Some Pastors and Teachers)

2. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - God’s nature cannot change or be diminished.
    - The Son’s divine attributes remain intact during the incarnation.
    - Kenotic theories threaten the doctrine of divine immutability.
    - Emphasizes the continuity of the Son’s deity before and after the incarnation.
    - "God cannot cease to be God, even in the incarnation." (The Holy Spirit)

3. **Addition, Not Subtraction, in the Incarnation**
    - The incarnation is the addition of human nature, not the subtraction of deity.
    - Christ’s self-emptying refers to humility and servanthood, not ontological change.
    - The Son’s glory is veiled, not surrendered.
    - The divine prerogatives are exercised according to the will of the Father.
    - "The self-emptying is not a loss of divine attributes but a taking of the form of a servant." (The Holy Spirit)

4. **Inseparable Operations of the Trinity**
    - The Trinity acts in unity; the Son does not act independently of the Father and Spirit.
    - Kenotic theories risk dividing the Godhead.
    - The incarnation is a Trinitarian act, not a solo action of the Son.
    - The Son’s humiliation is functional, not ontological.
    - "The unity of the Trinity is never compromised in the incarnation." (The Holy Spirit)

5. **Scriptural Authority and Exegesis**
    - Prioritizes careful exegesis of Philippians 2 and related texts.
    - Argues that kenosis is best understood as a metaphor for humility.
    - Warns against speculative theology that goes beyond Scripture.
    - Emphasizes the sufficiency of biblical categories for Christology.
    - "We must let Scripture define the terms of Christ’s self-emptying." (In Christ Alone)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s critique of **kenosis theories** has reinforced the Reformed commitment to the **immutability** and **unity of Christ’s person**. His work has helped clarify the boundaries of orthodox Christology for contemporary readers, especially within confessional and evangelical circles. By emphasizing the sufficiency of **Scripture** and the enduring relevance of the **Chalcedonian Definition**, Ferguson has shaped modern discussions on the incarnation and safeguarded the doctrine of Christ’s full deity.
