# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas firmly rejected **kenosis theories** that propose a real self-emptying or loss of divine attributes in the **Incarnation**. For Aquinas, the **hypostatic union** ensures that Christ’s divine nature remains fully intact and immutable, even as He assumes a complete human nature. His account safeguards the **immutability** and **impassibility** of God, insisting that any language of “emptying” in Philippians 2 refers to Christ’s assumption of a lowly human condition, not a divestment of divinity.

- "The divine nature was not changed into human nature, nor was any part of the divine nature changed into any part of the human nature, but the divine nature assumed the human nature into the unity of the Person." (Summa Theologiae III, q.2, a.6)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially III, qq. 1–6 (On the Incarnation)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, chs. 33–41
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book III, dist. 1–6
- De Veritate, q. 29 (On the Union of the Word Incarnate)
- Thomas Weinandy, Does God Suffer? (secondary, for Aquinas’s impassibility)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - God’s essence cannot undergo change or diminution.
    - The Incarnation does not involve subtraction from the divine nature.
    - Christ’s divine attributes remain fully operative during the Incarnation.
    - Kenosis is interpreted metaphorically, not ontologically.
    "It is impossible that the divine nature should be changed into the human, or conversely." (Summa Theologiae III, q.2, a.6)

2. **Hypostatic Union**
    - The union of divine and human natures occurs in the Person (hypostasis) of the Word.
    - Each nature retains its own properties without confusion or mixture.
    - The divine Person assumes a complete human nature, body and soul.
    - The unity is personal, not essential or accidental.
    "The union took place in the Person, and not in the nature." (Summa Theologiae III, q.2, a.3)

3. **Impassibility of God**
    - God cannot suffer or be affected by external forces.
    - Any suffering in Christ pertains to His human nature alone.
    - The divine nature remains untouched by human limitations.
    - Kenotic interpretations that ascribe suffering to the divine nature are rejected.
    "The Word of God did not suffer in His divinity, but in His flesh." (Summa Theologiae III, q.46, a.12)

4. **Scriptural Interpretation of Kenosis**
    - Philippians 2:7 (“emptied himself”) is read as Christ’s assumption of a humble condition.
    - “Emptying” refers to taking on human nature, not loss of divine attributes.
    - The passage is understood in light of Christ’s humility and obedience.
    - Theological language must respect the distinction of natures.
    "He is said to have emptied Himself, not by putting off His divine nature, but by taking the form of a servant." (Summa Theologiae III, q.1, a.2 ad 2)

5. **Rejection of Ontological Kenosis**
    - Any theory that posits a real limitation or surrender of divine attributes is denied.
    - The divine Logos remains omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.
    - The Incarnation is an addition (assumption of humanity), not a subtraction.
    - Kenosis theories are seen as incompatible with orthodox **Christology**.
    "The Son of God assumed human nature, but did not lose what He had." (Summa Contra Gentiles IV, ch. 38)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s robust defense of **immutability** and **impassibility** set the standard for classical **Christology** and shaped subsequent critiques of kenotic theories. His careful articulation of the **hypostatic union** remains foundational for both Roman Catholic and Reformed theology. Later theologians, especially in the Reformed tradition, have drawn on Aquinas’s arguments to resist modern kenotic Christologies that threaten the full deity of Christ. His influence endures in ongoing debates over the coherence of the Incarnation and the proper interpretation of Philippians 2.
