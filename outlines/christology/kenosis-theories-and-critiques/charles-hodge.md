# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge staunchly opposed **kenosis theories** of the incarnation, arguing that they compromise the true **deity of Christ** and violate the classical doctrine of **immutability**. He maintained that the **person of Christ** is fully divine and fully human, with both natures united in one person without any surrender or limitation of divine attributes, in full accord with the **Chalcedonian Definition**.

- "The Scriptures teach that Christ was truly God and truly man, and that the two natures were united in one person without confusion, change, division, or separation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially chapters on the Person of Christ)
- "The Incarnation" (Princeton Review, 1866)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Princeton Theological Seminary Lectures (archival material)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Immutability is Essential**
    - God’s **attributes** cannot be surrendered or diminished, even in the incarnation.
    - Any theory implying change in the divine nature is a denial of **orthodox theism**.
    - The divine Logos remains fully God while assuming human nature.
    - **Kenosis** is seen as incompatible with the unchangeable character of God.
    "God cannot cease to be what He is, nor can any of His attributes be suspended even for a moment." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Chalcedonian Christology Affirmed**
    - Hodge upholds the **two natures** doctrine: Christ is fully God and fully man.
    - The union is **hypostatic**, not a mixture or confusion of natures.
    - The divine and human natures retain their properties.
    - Any theory that blurs this distinction is rejected as heretical.
    "The union of the two natures in Christ is a personal union, not a fusion or confusion of the two." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Kenosis Undermines Divine Perfection**
    - Kenotic theories suggest the Logos gave up divine attributes, which Hodge rejects.
    - Such views compromise the **perfection** and **sovereignty** of Christ’s divinity.
    - The divine nature cannot be limited, even in the incarnation.
    - Hodge sees kenosis as a modern error contrary to scriptural teaching.
    "To suppose that the Logos divested Himself of His divine perfections is to suppose that He ceased to be God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Scriptural Authority over Speculation**
    - Hodge insists that **biblical revelation** governs Christological doctrine.
    - Kenosis is seen as speculative and lacking scriptural warrant.
    - The New Testament affirms both Christ’s deity and humanity without contradiction.
    - Doctrinal formulations must be rooted in exegesis, not philosophical innovation.
    "The Scriptures nowhere teach that the Son of God laid aside His divine attributes." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Redemptive Necessity of True Deity and Humanity**
    - Only one who is fully God and fully man can accomplish **redemption**.
    - Kenotic Christology threatens the sufficiency of Christ’s atoning work.
    - The mediator must possess both natures undiminished for effective mediation.
    - Hodge ties orthodox Christology directly to the doctrine of **salvation**.
    "If Christ were not truly God as well as truly man, He could not be the Savior of men." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust critique of **kenosis theories** shaped the response of American Reformed theology to modern Christological innovations. His defense of the **immutability of God** and the **Chalcedonian Definition** remains influential in conservative Protestant circles. Hodge’s insistence on the authority of Scripture and the necessity of both natures for redemption continues to inform contemporary debates on the person of Christ. His work set a standard for confessional orthodoxy in systematic theology.
