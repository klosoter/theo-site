# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **kenosis** not as a literal self-emptying of divine attributes, but as a symbol of the **divine self-limitation** inherent in the act of **incarnation**. He critiqued classical kenotic theories for their tendency to compromise the **unity of God** and instead emphasized the paradox of the **God-man** as the manifestation of the **New Being**, where divinity and humanity are united without confusion or division.

- "The assertion that God becomes man means that the power of being itself has accepted the conditions and the limits of human existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Kenosis as Symbolic, Not Literal**
    - Tillich interprets kenosis as a symbol for the **divine participation in human finitude**.
    - Rejects the idea that God literally gives up attributes or ceases to be fully divine.
    - Sees kenosis as expressing the existential depth of **divine love**.
    - Maintains that the **unity of the divine nature** is never compromised.
    - "Kenosis is the symbol for the acceptance of finitude by the infinite." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Unity of Divine and Human in the New Being**
    - Christ is the "New Being" in whom **divinity and humanity** are united without confusion.
    - The incarnation is not a subtraction of deity but a **manifestation of the divine in human form**.
    - The God-man is the answer to the existential estrangement of humanity.
    - The paradox of the incarnation is central, not a problem to be solved by kenotic reduction.
    - "The unity of the divine and the human in the Christ is the manifestation of the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Critique of Classical Kenotic Theories**
    - Argues that classical kenotic theories risk dividing the **divine essence**.
    - Warns against any Christology that implies a change in God's eternal nature.
    - Emphasizes the **symbolic depth** of biblical language over metaphysical speculation.
    - Prefers existential interpretation to ontological reductionism.
    - "The kenotic theory, if taken literally, destroys the unity of the divine nature." (A History of Christian Thought)

4. **Existential Interpretation of Incarnation**
    - The incarnation is the ultimate expression of **God’s participation in human estrangement**.
    - Focuses on the existential significance for human self-understanding.
    - The **self-limitation** of God is an act of love, not a metaphysical loss.
    - The incarnation reveals the possibility of reunion between God and humanity.
    - "The incarnation must be understood as the existential participation of God in the human predicament." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Revelation Through Paradox**
    - Tillich insists that the **paradox of the God-man** is essential to Christian faith.
    - Revelation occurs through the tension between divine transcendence and immanence.
    - The paradox is not to be resolved, but embraced as the ground of **Christian hope**.
    - Kenosis points to the mystery of divine self-giving, not to a logical contradiction.
    - "The paradox of the God-man is the heart of the Christian message." (The New Being)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential critique of **kenosis theories** redirected modern theology away from metaphysical debates about divine attributes toward the symbolic and existential significance of the incarnation. His emphasis on the **unity of God** and the paradox of the **New Being** has influenced both liberal and neo-orthodox Christologies. Tillich’s approach continues to shape discussions on the meaning of **incarnation** and the relationship between divine transcendence and immanence in contemporary theology.
