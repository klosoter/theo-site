# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the question of **kenosis** through his broader understanding of **Christology** and the **God-man relationship**. He rejected traditional **two-natures** formulations and instead emphasized the unique **God-consciousness** of Christ, critiquing kenotic theories that posited a literal self-emptying of divine attributes. For Schleiermacher, the incarnation is best understood as the perfect and uninterrupted presence of **divine causality** in the human life of Jesus.

- "The Redeemer is distinguished from all men by the constant potency of his God-consciousness, which was a veritable existence of God in him." (The Christian Faith, §94)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- On the Doctrine of Election
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christliche Sittenlehre (Christian Ethics)
- The Life of Jesus

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s God-consciousness as the locus of divinity**
    - Christ’s uniqueness lies in his perfect and uninterrupted **God-consciousness**.
    - The divine is not a separate substance but is present through Christ’s consciousness.
    - This approach avoids metaphysical speculation about the divine nature’s limitations.
    - Kenosis is reinterpreted as the full realization of divine presence in human life.
    - "In him the existence of God in human form is realized as a constant potency." (The Christian Faith, §94)

2. **Rejection of traditional two-natures Christology**
    - Schleiermacher critiques the Chalcedonian definition as philosophically incoherent.
    - He denies a literal division or mixture of divine and human natures.
    - The unity of Christ is found in the divine causality operating within his human existence.
    - Kenotic theories are seen as unnecessary and speculative.
    - "The Redeemer’s divine nature is not a second substance but the God-consciousness itself." (The Christian Faith, §93)

3. **Critique of kenotic self-limitation**
    - Schleiermacher rejects the idea that the Logos could divest itself of divine attributes.
    - He argues that divine attributes are not transferable or reducible.
    - The incarnation does not involve a subtraction from divinity but a unique mode of presence.
    - Kenosis is thus a metaphor for the manner of divine indwelling, not a metaphysical change.
    - "The divine essence cannot be diminished or laid aside, but is present in a new way." (The Christian Faith, §97)

4. **Emphasis on the ethical and religious significance of Christ**
    - The focus is on Christ’s role as the founder of the Christian community.
    - Christ’s perfect God-consciousness is the source of redemption and ethical transformation.
    - The incarnation is meaningful in its impact on human religious experience.
    - Kenosis is interpreted through the lens of Christ’s exemplary human life.
    - "The Redeemer’s influence consists in awakening and communicating God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §106)

5. **Doctrine of divine causality in the incarnation**
    - Schleiermacher sees the incarnation as the highest degree of divine causality in a human.
    - This causality is not a metaphysical descent but an existential reality.
    - The divine operates through Christ’s human faculties without loss of divinity.
    - Kenosis is thus the fullest possible manifestation of God in human form.
    - "The divine causality is present in Christ in a way that is unique and unrepeatable." (The Christian Faith, §94)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **kenosis** shifted the focus from metaphysical speculation to the existential and religious dimensions of the incarnation. His critique of traditional **two-natures Christology** and kenotic theories influenced later liberal and existential theologians, including Ritschl and Tillich. While his approach was controversial among confessional theologians, it remains foundational for modern discussions of Christ’s person and the meaning of divine self-giving. Schleiermacher’s emphasis on **God-consciousness** continues to shape contemporary Christological debates.
