### ESSAY
Kenosis theories force the candidate to stand at the intersection of exegesis, conciliar Christology, and the doctrine of God. At stake is whether the church can affirm that the Son truly “emptied himself” in Philippians 2 without conceding that God ceases to be God. Properly understood, kenosis is not a metaphysical reduction of the Logos but the historical form of his **condescending assumption of human nature** and obedient humiliation. My claim is that the classical two-natures framework, governed by **divine immutability** and **divine simplicity**, can and must integrate a robust theology of self-emptying, while the stronger nineteenth and twentieth century kenotic theories collapse the very conditions that make redemptive humiliation salvific, namely that the one who humbles himself is the immutable Lord of glory.

Conceptually, kenosis concerns the mode of the Son’s incarnation and incarnate existence. The basic exegetical anchor is Philippians 2:6–8: although existing in the form of God, Christ “emptied himself” by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men, and humbling himself to the point of death on a cross. Classical Christology, as crystallized at Chalcedon, predicates two complete natures, divine and human, united in one person without confusion, change, division or separation. The key patristic and scholastic move is to interpret “emptied” as an economic, not ontological, description: the Son empties himself not by ceasing to be what he eternally is, but by assuming what he was not and by veiling his glory under the form of servanthood. In modern kenotic theories, however, “emptying” is given a metaphysical bite: the Logos is said to surrender or suspend the exercise, or even the possession, of certain **incommunicable attributes** such as omniscience or omnipresence in order genuinely to live a finite human life. This reframing attempts to secure the genuineness of Christ’s human limitations at the cost of the classical doctrine of God.

The first decisive figure for modern kenosis is Gottfried Thomasius, a nineteenth century Lutheran theologian whose work in the 1840s and 1850s inaugurated what is often called the classic kenotic school. Thomasius was shaped by both Lutheran Christology and the pressures of post Kantian philosophy and historical consciousness. He was dissatisfied with traditional Lutheran ubiquity of Christ’s human nature and with what he perceived as docetic tendencies in older orthodoxy’s talk of the Logos using the human nature as a mere instrument. Reading Philippians 2 through a historicist lens, he argued that the Logos, in becoming man, voluntarily limited himself by surrendering the relative use of certain divine attributes. Thomasius did not say that the Son ceased to be God in an absolute sense, but he proposed a kind of “metaphysical kenosis” in which the preexistent Son renounces the independent exercise of omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence in order to grow, learn, suffer, and obey as a man in real dependence on the Father.

Thomasius’ methodological shift is crucial. Rather than letting the definitive metaphysical commitments of Nicene and Chalcedonian dogma set the frame for exegesis, he treated Philippians 2 and the phenomena of Christ’s human life as demanding a reform of metaphysics itself. The unity of person remains, but the divine nature is reconceived in a “self limiting” direction. Examiners will press at this point: does Thomasius not violate **divine immutability** by positing a change in the mode or extent of the Son’s possession or exercise of attributes? Thomasius would answer that the change is not in God’s eternal being but in the Logos’ state and mode of existence ad extra. Yet this distinction blurs under pressure. If omniscience is essential to the divine nature, it is not clear how the Logos can cease to know certain things, even relatively, without ceasing to be fully divine. Nor does Thomasius secure the **communicatio idiomatum** in its classical sense, since it is now difficult to say that the man Jesus is omniscient according to the person, when in fact the person has surrendered omniscience in order to be authentically human. Thomasius’ contribution thus lies in dramatizing the tension between phenomenological Christology and classical metaphysics, but his solution compromises the latter.

An Anglican development of kenosis appears in Charles Gore, a leading proponent of Lux Mundi at the end of the nineteenth century. Gore faced the rising tide of historical criticism and evolutionary science. To render Christ believable in a modern world, he embraced a kenotic Christology that interprets the Son’s self-emptying as a real acceptance of the limitations of first century Jewish consciousness. For Gore, the incarnate Son is truly ignorant of various matters, including scientific facts and even some theological detail, because he has genuinely bound himself to the horizon of his historical context. This allows Gore to affirm that Christ could share in the limited cosmologies and exegetical assumptions of his contemporaries without deceiving them. Gore explicitly draws on Philippians 2 to argue that such limitations are precisely the form of Christ’s moral greatness: humility entails accepting ignorance.

Gore’s move deepens the metaphysical thinning begun by Thomasius. If the Logos is genuinely ignorant as to his human consciousness, then either the human mind is cut off from the divine mind, in which case the unity of person is called into question, or the divine mind itself has refrained from omniscience. Either way, Gore’s position threatens both **divine simplicity** and the integrity of the **hypostatic union**. Classical Christology had spoken of the Son’s growth in wisdom by assigning it to the human nature and by using the principle of **anhypostasia–enhypostasia**, namely that the human nature has no personal subsistence outside the Logos, but truly subsists in the person of the Son. This allows us to say that the one person experiences genuinely human learning without implying that the Logos as such learns. Gore’s version of kenosis obscures that distinction in order to make Christ more accessible to modern sensibility. The result is a Christ whose soteriological efficacy is undermined, because the one who redeems us no longer clearly stands as the omniscient Lord entering ignorance for our sake, but as a finite consciousness with divinity redefined as moral God consciousness under conditions of nescience.

A third figure, P. T. Forsyth, complicates the picture by maintaining a strong sense of divine holiness and atonement while still employing a kenotic framework. Forsyth, working in early twentieth century Britain, reacted against moral influence theories and liberal trivialization of sin. For him, Christ’s cross is the self condemnation of God’s holiness, and therefore the incarnate one must be truly God. Yet Forsyth was wary of any Christology that would turn Jesus into a theophanic appearance detached from real moral struggle. His kenotic move was to interpret the Son’s self emptying as the eternal God taking into his own experience the conditions of moral conflict, temptation, and suffering from within. Forsyth frequently speaks of God’s self limitation in order to love and redeem, a kenosis located not only in the incarnation but, more fundamentally, in the eternal character of divine love.

Forsyth’s approach edges toward what later theologians will call a “cruciform” or “suffering” **doctrine of God**, in which divine immutability is reinterpreted as faithfulness in self giving rather than as metaphysical unchangeability. An examiner might ask whether Forsyth, by locating kenosis in the very being of God, does not in fact erase the Creator–creature distinction and make God intrinsically passible. Forsyth would reply that God’s suffering is holy and triumphant, not passive in the creaturely sense. Still, his kenotic ontology pressures classical accounts of **impassibility** and **aseity**. By contrast, a Reformed and classical position can affirm that the incarnate Son truly suffered and struggled according to his human nature, and that this suffering is personally the suffering of the Son of God, without locating mutability in the divine nature itself. The cross then reveals who God eternally is, not because God becomes something he was not, but because in the incarnation God manifests under temporal, passible conditions the eternal plenitude of his holy love.

Against this background of Protestant kenotic experiments, Karl Rahner represents a decisive Catholic response that seeks to incorporate some intuitions of kenosis while preserving conciliar dogma. In his essay “Current Problems in Christology” and throughout his writings, Rahner advances the thesis that the incarnation is the unique case of the self communication of God that constitutes a human person as the human reality of the divine person of the Logos. Rahner is deeply committed to **divine immutability** and **divine simplicity**. He denies any literal divestment of attributes. Yet he insists that the Logos’ assumption of a human nature entails a genuine historical and psychological development in Jesus, including growth in knowledge and self understanding. He parses this through a transcendental anthropology in which human freedom and history are already always the site of God’s self communication. The kenosis consists not in God’s ceasing to be God but in the Logos’ acceptance of the finite conditions of human consciousness, under which his divine self knowledge is mediated. Thus Rahner speaks of a “unity of consciousness” in Christ that is asymmetrical: the divine subject grounds and encompasses the human consciousness, yet experiences himself humanly from within that finite horizon.

Rahner’s position offers an important corrective to crude kenoticism. He retains the classical conviction that the Son does not become other than what he eternally is. At the same time, he resists any picture of Christ’s human life as a mere façade for an omniscient subject. He wants the psychical life of Jesus to be truly human. An examiner might challenge Rahner by asking whether his transcendental method risks turning the concrete Jesus into a cipher for a general structure of grace. More sharply, one could press whether his “mediation” language obscures the clear distinction between the eternal act of divine knowing and the temporal acquisition of human knowledge. From a more classically Reformed standpoint, one would affirm with Rahner that Jesus genuinely learns and grows in human knowledge, but would insist that this affects only the created cognitive acts of the human soul. The person of the Son, in his divine nature, remains unbounded in omniscience. The integrity of **two natures Christology** depends on distinguishing between the person as subject of both sets of properties and the natures as the metaphysical principles by which he operates. Kenosis, therefore, describes not a contraction of the divine act, but the assumption and exercise of a created mode of knowing and willing in unity of person.

Thomas F. Torrance, our fifth decisive figure, offers a distinctively Reformed and patristic retrieval that strongly critiques kenotic metaphysics while retaining a rich sense of redemptive self emptying. Torrance, influenced by Athanasius and the Cappadocians, relentlessly emphasizes that “what is not assumed is not healed.” For him, the incarnation is the movement of the eternal Son into the midst of our fallen existence to heal it from within. Torrance rejects any notion that in becoming incarnate the Son abandons or suspends the exercise of his divine attributes. To do so would be to capitulate to a mythological rather than theological reading of kenosis. The Son’s coming is not a journey from being divine to being human, but the sovereign decision of the immutable Son to take our humanity into hypostatic union with himself. Torrance therefore interprets Philippians 2 in line with the fathers: the “emptying” occurs “by taking” the form of a servant, not by subtracting deity.

Torrance’s crucial move is to locate kenosis at the level of economic hiddenness and humiliation, rather than ontological diminution. The glory of God is veiled under the lowliness of Jesus’ life and death, yet never absent. The incarnate Son lives a life of vicarious obedience, penetrating into the depths of human estrangement, bearing our judgment on the cross. This is kenosis as the descent of holy love, not as divine self reduction. Examiners may push here: if Christ never divests himself of omniscience or omnipotence, can his temptations and sufferings be genuine? Torrance would answer that genuineness does not require ignorance at the level of person, but full participation in our condition at the level of assumed nature. The human nature, with its finite cognitive and affective capacities, is the vehicle through which the Son endures real weakness and trials. The fact that the one who suffers is the eternal Son intensifies, rather than diminishes, the drama. Moreover, Torrance insists that **divine impassibility** means that God does not suffer in a passive, involuntary way, but does not preclude the free, sovereign assumption of suffering in the incarnation. Thus the Son is impassible in his divinity yet truly passible in his humanity, without any division of person.

So far the internal Protestant kenotic debates and their classical and Catholic critiques have been surveyed. The external debate layer involves more radical challenges both from modern theology and philosophy of religion. Process thought and some open theist proposals go beyond Thomasius and Gore by redefining God as essentially self emptying love, mutable and temporally conditioned. Here kenosis is no longer primarily Christological but ontological: God’s being is kenotic in that he surrenders control and foreknowledge in order to relate to a free world. In this framework, the classical **attributes** of aseity, immutability, and simplicity are replaced by relational dynamism. Against such positions, one must insist that without **aseity** and **immutability** there is no stable subject capable of redemptive self giving. A God who is constituted by the world cannot genuinely stoop to save it. The incarnation becomes a moment in the co development of God and world rather than the decisive incursion of the Lord into his creation.

Contemporary analytic Christology also presses kenotic questions in technically refined ways. Discussions of **two minds Christology**, such as those by Thomas Morris and others, attempt to conceptualize how one person can have both a divine and a human consciousness. Some analytic theologians explore “functional” kenoticism, where the Logos voluntarily refrains from the use of certain cognitive contents at the human level, while retaining them at the divine level. The objection examiners may voice is whether this simply reintroduces Thomasius under a more careful guise. A classical response is to distinguish between the possession of an attribute and the manner in which it is manifest. The Son always possesses omniscience and omnipotence according to the divine nature, but he does not always manifest these through his assumed humanity. This is not a suspension of attributes but a mode of economic discretion. For instance, Christ may ask questions or express ignorance according to his human mind, while still possessing divine knowledge in his divine mind. The unity of person prevents any Nestorian separation, while the duality of natures secures genuine human limitation.

Another contemporary layer arises in political and liberation theologies, which invoke kenosis as a paradigm for solidarity with the oppressed and for noncoercive power. Here Philippians 2 becomes a charter for self emptying leadership and structural critique. While this ethical appropriation has value, it often proceeds by abstracting kenosis from its ontological grounding in the incarnate Son. If Christ’s kenosis is paradigmatic, it is because he is first the Lord who humbles himself. The ethical call to self emptying cannot be severed from the confession of **incarnate Lordship** without reducing kenosis to ideology.

Given these layers, the position I defend is that kenosis, rightly construed, is wholly compatible with and indeed requires classical **two natures Christology** and **classical theism**. Philippians 2 depicts the preexistent Son, in the form of God, not grasping at his equality with God but emptying himself by taking the form of a servant. The participle “by taking” specifies the mode of emptying: not subtraction but addition. The humiliation of the Son lies in his assumption of a lowly condition and in his obedient submission to suffering and death. This humiliation is real and profound precisely because the subject is the eternal Son who remains fully divine in and through it. Kenosis does not entail the laying aside of divine attributes, but their paradoxical exercise under the veil of weakness, in an economy of concealment.

This position safeguards several adjacent loci. In the doctrine of God, it preserves **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** as necessary conditions for God’s sovereign freedom to act in grace. In Christology, it maintains the Chalcedonian grammar of one person in two natures, the integrity of the **communicatio idiomatum**, and the principle of **anhypostasia–enhypostasia**, against both Nestorian and Eutychian drifts that often accompany strong kenotic models. In soteriology, it ensures that the cross is the act of God himself, not of a reduced or semi divine subject, thereby upholding the infinite worth of the atonement. In epistemology, it undergirds **analogical knowledge**: we affirm positively that God empties himself, yet we deny all creaturely connotations of loss, compulsion, or ontological diminishment, and we elevate the term to signify the sovereign, free act of the immutable Lord to assume and bear our state.

Common examiner objections can be anticipated and answered. If pressed that this account leaves Christ’s humanity unreal because he retains omniscience and omnipotence, one must clarify that what makes a consciousness human is not ignorance as such but finitude in the mode of knowing and willing. The human mind of Christ is truly finite, located, and historically conditioned, even if personally united to an omniscient subject. If asked whether this makes Christ “two persons” with two consciousnesses, one should stress the asymmetrical unity: there is one acting subject, the eternal Son, who operates according to two distinct sets of cognitive and volitional capacities. The relation between these is mysterious but not contradictory, just as the relation between God’s eternal decree and temporal events is mysterious yet affirmed. If questioned whether this undermines his solidarity with us, one can respond that solidarity is maximized when the one who is like us in all things except sin is also utterly unlike us in being God. It is precisely because he is the immutable Lord who assumes our mutable state that his self emptying love saves.

Thus kenosis, when freed from metaphysical self reduction and read within the Chalcedonian and classical theistic framework, emerges not as a problem to be solved by trimming divine attributes, but as a mystery that exhibits their glory in redemptive form. The Son’s self emptying is the historical enactment of what it eternally means for God to be love: not the abandonment of **divine fullness**, but its radiant descent into the far country of our sin and death.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Kenosis names the incarnate Son’s **self emptying** in Philippians 2, rightly understood as his assumption of the form of a servant and historical humiliation, not a real divestment or suspension of divine attributes.
- Decisive figures:
  - Gottfried Thomasius: inaugurated modern kenoticism by proposing a voluntary limitation of the Logos’ use of attributes, compromising **immutability**.
  - Charles Gore: Anglican kenoticism, stressing Christ’s acceptance of historical and cognitive limitations, tending toward divine ignorance.
  - P. T. Forsyth: kenotic emphasis on God’s holy love and suffering, pressing on **impassibility** and aseity.
  - Karl Rahner: Catholic retrieval, rejecting metaphysical kenosis while emphasizing real human development and mediated divine self knowledge.
  - Thomas F. Torrance: patristic Reformed critique, locating kenosis in economic humiliation and veiling, not ontological diminution.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Competing Protestant kenotic models versus classical Chalcedonian interpretive strategies for Philippians 2; differing accounts of how Christ’s human limitations relate to **two natures Christology**.
  - External: Process and open theist “ontological kenosis” versus **classical theism**; philosophical worries about coherence of one person with two minds.
  - Contemporary: Analytic “functional” kenoticism and two minds models; liberationist and political uses of kenosis detached from ontology.
- Defended position: Kenosis must be understood as the incarnate Son’s economic self humbling through the assumption of a lowly human condition and obedience unto death, fully compatible with **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and the unabridged possession of all divine attributes.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does genuine human ignorance in Christ require divine ignorance? Answer: No, ignorance and learning belong to Christ’s human nature, while the person of the Son remains omniscient according to his divine nature.
  - Does your view make Christ’s temptations unreal? Answer: No, temptations are real at the level of his assumed human faculties, and are intensified because the tempted one is the divine Son.
  - How do you avoid Nestorianism with “two minds”? Answer: By insisting on one acting subject, the Logos, who subsists and operates in two distinct but united sets of cognitive and volitional capacities.
  - Is divine impassibility compatible with the cross? Answer: Yes, God is impassible in his divine nature yet freely assumes passible human nature, so that the Son truly suffers without any change in the divine essence.
  - How does kenosis relate ethically to Christian life? Answer: Ethically, believers imitate Christ’s self humbling, but this is grounded in and normed by the unique kenosis of the incarnate Lord, not by a general theory of divine self limitation.
