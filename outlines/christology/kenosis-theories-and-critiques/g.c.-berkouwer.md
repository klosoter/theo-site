# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer engaged **kenosis theories** critically, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the full **divinity and humanity of Christ** without compromising either. He rejected speculative approaches that undermine the **Chalcedonian Definition** and insisted that the mystery of the **incarnation** must be preserved within the bounds of **biblical revelation** and **Reformed Christology**.

- "The kenosis theory, in its various forms, always threatens to obscure the true mystery of the incarnation by seeking to explain it in terms of human categories." (The Person of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Person of Christ (Studies in Dogmatics)
- The Work of Christ (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Holy Scripture (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Faith and Revelation
- Modern Theology and Truth

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Literal Kenosis**
    - Argues that Christ did not divest himself of divine attributes in the incarnation.
    - Maintains that **divine immutability** is essential to orthodox Christology.
    - Views kenosis theories as speculative and lacking biblical warrant.
    - Emphasizes the unity of Christ’s person as fully God and fully man.
    - "The idea that the Logos could cease to possess divine attributes is foreign to the New Testament witness." (The Person of Christ)

2. **Affirmation of Chalcedonian Christology**
    - Upholds the **two natures** of Christ, divine and human, united in one person.
    - Insists that neither nature is diminished or altered in the incarnation.
    - Sees the Chalcedonian formula as a safeguard against both kenotic and docetic errors.
    - Stresses the importance of the **communicatio idiomatum** within orthodox boundaries.
    - "The Chalcedonian Definition remains the necessary framework for understanding the mystery of Christ’s person." (The Person of Christ)

3. **Primacy of Biblical Revelation**
    - Critiques kenosis theories for going beyond the data of Scripture.
    - Argues that the incarnation must be understood in terms of **biblical categories**.
    - Warns against philosophical speculation that eclipses biblical testimony.
    - Sees the mystery of the incarnation as something to be confessed, not explained away.
    - "The mystery of Christ’s humiliation is not to be solved by human speculation, but to be received in faith." (The Person of Christ)

4. **Preservation of Divine Sovereignty**
    - Asserts that Christ’s divine sovereignty is never suspended in the incarnation.
    - Rejects any notion that the Son relinquished divine prerogatives.
    - Emphasizes the continued exercise of divine power and authority by the incarnate Son.
    - Connects Christ’s ongoing sovereignty to the efficacy of redemption.
    - "The redemptive work of Christ depends upon the undiminished reality of his divine sovereignty." (The Work of Christ)

5. **Mystery and Paradox in the Incarnation**
    - Affirms that the incarnation is ultimately a divine mystery.
    - Warns against rationalistic attempts to resolve the paradox of Christ’s person.
    - Encourages reverence and humility before the limits of human understanding.
    - Sees paradox as intrinsic to the doctrine of the incarnation.
    - "The paradox of the incarnation is not a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be adored." (The Person of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s critique of **kenosis theories** has shaped Reformed engagement with modern Christological debates, reinforcing the centrality of the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the necessity of biblical fidelity. His insistence on the mystery and paradox of the **incarnation** has encouraged a posture of theological humility. Berkouwer’s work continues to serve as a resource for those seeking to uphold orthodox Christology against both speculative and reductionist tendencies.
