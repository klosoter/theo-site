# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til critiqued **kenosis theories** as fundamentally incompatible with **Reformed Christology** and the **Creator-creature distinction**. He insisted that any doctrine of the **incarnation** must uphold the full **immutability** and **aseity** of the divine nature, rejecting any suggestion that the Son divested Himself of divine attributes in the act of becoming man.

- "If God could lay aside his attributes, he would cease to be God." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creator-Creature Distinction is Absolute**
    - God and creation are ontologically distinct; the Son cannot become less than God.
    - Kenosis theories blur the line between the infinite and the finite.
    - The incarnation is a mystery, not a reduction of deity.
    - Any compromise undermines the transcendence of God.
    - "The Creator-creature distinction must be maintained at every point." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - God’s attributes, including omniscience and omnipotence, are unchangeable.
    - Kenosis implies change in the divine essence, which Van Til rejects.
    - The Son’s assumption of human nature does not entail loss of deity.
    - Immutability safeguards the reliability and faithfulness of God.
    - "God cannot change; if he could, he would not be God." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Rejection of Kenotic Christology**
    - Kenotic theories are rooted in non-Reformed philosophical presuppositions.
    - They fail to account for the biblical witness to Christ’s full divinity.
    - Van Til sees kenosis as a concession to modernist theology.
    - The Reformed tradition affirms the **hypostatic union** without diminution of deity.
    - "Kenoticism is but another form of the age-old attempt to bring God down to the level of man." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Doctrine of the Incarnation: Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ is one person in two natures, divine and human, without confusion or change.
    - The divine nature remains fully intact in the incarnation.
    - The union is personal, not essential; the natures do not intermingle.
    - This upholds both the transcendence and immanence of Christ.
    - "The two natures are united in one person, not mixed or diminished." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Presuppositional Critique of Modern Theology**
    - Modern kenotic theories arise from autonomous human reasoning.
    - True theology begins with the self-attesting Christ of Scripture.
    - Any Christology must be governed by the authority of **revelation**.
    - Van Til’s apologetic method exposes the inadequacy of kenotic presuppositions.
    - "All reasoning must start from the presupposition of the triune God as revealed in Scripture." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s critique of **kenosis theories** has shaped Reformed responses to modern Christological trends, reinforcing the centrality of the **Creator-creature distinction** and the immutability of God. His presuppositional approach continues to influence theological method, insisting that all doctrines, including the incarnation, must be grounded in the self-revelation of God. Van Til’s legacy endures in the defense of orthodox Christology against both liberal and neo-orthodox reinterpretations.
