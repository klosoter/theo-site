# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin rejected **kenosis theories** that suggest Christ divested himself of divine attributes in the **Incarnation**. Instead, Calvin maintained the **immutability** and **impassibility** of the divine nature, affirming that Christ’s **two natures**—divine and human—remained distinct and unconfused in the one person of the Son. For Calvin, the humiliation of Christ refers to his assumption of true humanity and voluntary submission, not a surrender of deity.

- "For even though the Word was bound within the narrow limits of flesh, he filled the world even as he had always done." (Institutes II.xiii.4)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book II, chapters 12–14)
- Commentary on the Gospel According to John
- Sermons on the Deity of Christ
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (McNeill/Battles edition)
- The Person of Christ (secondary: Donald Macleod)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - Christ’s divine nature remains unchanged and undiminished in the Incarnation.
    - Calvin rejects any notion that the Son “emptied” himself of deity or divine attributes.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** does not entail a transfer or loss of divine properties.
    - The humiliation of Christ is a matter of status and experience, not essence.
    - "He did not cease to be in heaven while he was on earth." (Institutes II.xiii.4)

2. **Two Natures, One Person (Chalcedonian Christology)**
    - Christ is fully God and fully man, with each nature retaining its properties.
    - The union is personal, not essential or transformative of either nature.
    - Calvin upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** against both Nestorian and Eutychian errors.
    - The natures are united without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - "We affirm that Christ is God and man, in such a way that each nature retains its own properties." (Institutes II.xiv.4)

3. **Kenosis as Voluntary Humiliation, Not Ontological Change**
    - The “emptying” (kenosis) of Philippians 2 is interpreted as Christ’s taking the form of a servant.
    - Calvin insists this refers to Christ’s assumption of human weakness, not loss of divinity.
    - Christ’s divine glory was veiled, not surrendered, during his earthly ministry.
    - The Son’s self-humbling is an act of obedience, not a subtraction of divine attributes.
    - "He kept his divinity concealed under the weakness of flesh." (Commentary on Philippians 2:7)

4. **Rejection of Kenotic Theories**
    - Calvin opposes any teaching that suggests a real divestment of divine attributes.
    - He sees kenotic theories as undermining the **immutability** and **impassibility** of God.
    - Such views threaten the integrity of the **Incarnation** and the reality of redemption.
    - Calvin’s exegesis emphasizes the continuity of Christ’s divine operations.
    - "It is a great absurdity to imagine any change in the essence of God." (Institutes II.xiii.4)

5. **Christ’s Mediation Depends on Full Deity and Humanity**
    - Only one who is truly God and truly man can mediate between God and humanity.
    - Calvin’s soteriology is grounded in the unbroken union of both natures in Christ.
    - Any diminution of Christ’s deity would render his work ineffective for salvation.
    - The **mediatorial office** presupposes the full possession of both natures.
    - "Unless the divinity remained hidden under the covering of the flesh, it would not have been possible for us to have communion with God." (Institutes II.xiv.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust defense of the **immutability of Christ’s divine nature** decisively shaped Reformed critiques of kenosis theories. His exegesis and theological method provided a foundation for later confessional standards, such as the Westminster Confession, in affirming the unconfused union of two natures in Christ. Calvin’s approach remains a touchstone for orthodox Christology, especially in debates over the meaning of Christ’s humiliation and the limits of **kenotic speculation**.
