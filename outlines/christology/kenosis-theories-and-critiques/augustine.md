# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not develop a formal **kenosis theory** as later theologians did, but his writings on the **Incarnation** and **Christology** provide foundational critiques of any view that would compromise the **immutability** or **divinity** of Christ. He consistently affirmed that in the **Word becoming flesh**, the **divine nature** remained unchanged, and that Christ’s self-emptying was a matter of **humility** and **assumption of human nature**, not a surrender of divine attributes.

- "He did not lose what He was, but He began to be what He was not." (Sermon 187)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- Sermons (especially Sermon 187)
- Letters (Epistulae)
- City of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - God’s nature cannot change or diminish, even in the Incarnation.
    - The Son remains fully **God** while assuming true humanity.
    - Any suggestion of the Word “emptying” Himself of divinity is rejected.
    - The Incarnation is a union, not a transformation, of natures.
    - "The Word was made flesh, not by losing what He was, but by taking what He was not." (Sermon 187)

2. **True Assumption of Human Nature**
    - Christ truly took on a complete human nature, body and soul.
    - The **humanity** of Christ is real, not illusory or partial.
    - The divine nature is not diminished by the assumption of humanity.
    - The union is hypostatic: one person, two natures.
    - "He added to Himself what He was not, He did not lose what He was." (De Trinitate I.14)

3. **Christ’s Humility as Voluntary Condescension**
    - The “emptying” (kenosis) refers to Christ’s humility, not loss of divinity.
    - Christ’s humility is expressed in His birth, suffering, and death.
    - The divine nature remains exalted even in the state of humiliation.
    - The humility of Christ is a model for believers, not a metaphysical change.
    - "He humbled Himself, not by losing what He was, but by taking what He was not." (Enchiridion 35)

4. **Unity of Person in Christ**
    - The **person** of the Son is the subject of both divine and human actions.
    - There is no mixture or confusion of natures in the Incarnation.
    - The unity is maintained without alteration of either nature.
    - The Son’s actions are attributed to the one person, not divided between natures.
    - "Both natures meet in one person, so that He is both God and man." (De Trinitate I.7)

5. **Critique of Theories Diminishing Christ’s Divinity**
    - Augustine opposes any view that implies the Son ceased to be fully God.
    - He rejects interpretations of Philippians 2 that suggest ontological change.
    - The **kenosis** is interpreted as taking on the form of a servant, not surrendering divine prerogatives.
    - The divine attributes remain intact and operative in the Incarnate Christ.
    - "He did not empty Himself of His divinity, but took the form of a servant." (Sermon 187)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s robust defense of the **immutability** and **full divinity** of Christ decisively shaped Western Christology and set boundaries for later discussions of **kenosis**. His insistence on the hypostatic union and the unchanging nature of the Word provided a critical foundation for orthodox critiques of kenotic theories that emerged in the modern era. Augustine’s thought remains a touchstone for evaluating any Christological proposal that risks compromising the essential attributes of the divine nature.
