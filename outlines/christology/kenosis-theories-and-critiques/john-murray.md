# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray firmly rejected **kenosis theories** as incompatible with the historic **doctrine of the incarnation**. He maintained that Christ’s **divine attributes** were not surrendered or diminished in the incarnation, emphasizing the **immutability** and **unity of the person of Christ** as essential to orthodox **Reformed Christology**.

- "The Son of God did not cease to be what he was in becoming what he was not." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "The Person of Christ" (essay in Collected Writings)
- Principles of Conduct

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - Christ’s **divine nature** remains unchanged and undiminished in the incarnation.
    - Kenosis theories wrongly imply a change or limitation in the **divine attributes**.
    - The **immutability** of God is foundational to Murray’s critique of kenosis.
    - Any theory suggesting God can "empty" himself of deity is rejected as unbiblical.
    - "If Christ divested himself of any divine attribute, he would cease to be God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - The incarnation is the union of two natures in one **person** without confusion or division.
    - Kenosis theories threaten the integrity of this **hypostatic union**.
    - Murray insists that Christ is fully God and fully man simultaneously.
    - The person of Christ is not divided into a "reduced" deity and a human.
    - "The person is one, and the two natures are united without confusion, change, division, or separation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Functional Limitation of Deity**
    - Christ’s **self-limitation** pertains to his human experience, not his divine essence.
    - Kenosis theories confuse voluntary **humiliation** with ontological change.
    - Murray distinguishes between Christ’s **humbling** and any loss of divine prerogatives.
    - The **incarnation** involves addition (humanity), not subtraction (deity).
    - "The humiliation consisted not in the laying aside of deity but in the taking of humanity." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Biblical Fidelity in Christology**
    - Murray grounds his Christology in the **biblical witness** to Christ’s person.
    - He critiques kenosis theories as lacking exegetical support.
    - The **Scriptures** affirm both Christ’s full deity and full humanity.
    - Any theory that undermines biblical testimony is to be rejected.
    - "The New Testament does not teach that the Son of God surrendered his divine attributes." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Defense of Classical Reformed Christology**
    - Murray upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the standard for orthodox Christology.
    - He sees kenosis as a departure from the **Reformed confessions**.
    - The **two natures** doctrine safeguards the mystery and reality of the incarnation.
    - Murray’s critique reinforces the continuity of Reformed theology with historic orthodoxy.
    - "The Reformed faith maintains the full deity and full humanity of Christ in one person, without compromise." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust defense of the **immutability of Christ’s divine nature** and his critique of kenosis theories have shaped Reformed responses to modern Christological innovations. His insistence on the **unity of Christ’s person** and the authority of Scripture continues to influence systematic theology at Westminster and beyond. By upholding the classical **Reformed Christological tradition**, Murray provided a clear and enduring alternative to kenotic speculation.
