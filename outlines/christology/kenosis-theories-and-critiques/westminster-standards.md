# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** reject **kenosis theories** by upholding the **immutability** and **impassibility** of the divine nature in the **incarnation** of Christ. They affirm that Christ is one **person in two distinct natures**, fully God and fully man, without confusion, change, division, or separation, thus denying any notion that the Son divested Himself of divine attributes in becoming human.

- "Two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion." (Westminster Confession of Faith, 8.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 2, 8)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 36–40)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 21–23)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on Christ’s person and work)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on Christology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - God is "without body, parts, or passions," and cannot change.
    - The divine nature of Christ remains fully divine during the incarnation.
    - Any theory suggesting the Son relinquished divine attributes is rejected.
    - The union of natures does not involve alteration of either nature.
    - "God is without body, parts, or passions; immutable..." (WCF 2.1)

2. **Hypostatic Union Without Confusion or Change**
    - Christ is one person in two distinct natures, divine and human.
    - The natures are united "without conversion, composition, or confusion."
    - The divine nature is not diminished or altered by the incarnation.
    - The human nature is assumed, not absorbed or mixed with the divine.
    - "The Godhead and the manhood were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion." (WCF 8.2)

3. **Fullness of Deity in Christ**
    - Christ retains all divine attributes even in His incarnate state.
    - The Son’s divine prerogatives are never surrendered or emptied.
    - The fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Christ.
    - Kenotic theories are seen as undermining the true deity of Christ.
    - "In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." (WLC Q. 36, citing Col. 2:9)

4. **Impassibility and Divine Self-Sufficiency**
    - God, including the Son, is not subject to suffering or change in His divine nature.
    - The sufferings of Christ pertain to His human nature alone.
    - The divine nature remains impassible even as the person of Christ suffers.
    - Any attribution of passibility to the divine nature is rejected.
    - "God is... most absolute, working all things according to the counsel of his own immutable and most righteous will..." (WCF 2.2)

5. **Rejection of Kenotic Christology**
    - Kenosis theories are inconsistent with the Standards’ doctrine of Christ’s person.
    - The "emptying" of the Son refers to His taking the form of a servant, not loss of deity.
    - The humiliation of Christ is functional and economic, not ontological.
    - The Standards uphold the classical doctrine against modern kenotic reinterpretations.
    - "Christ, in the work of mediation, acteth according to both natures; by each nature doing that which is proper to itself..." (WCF 8.7)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have decisively shaped **Reformed Christology**, providing a robust framework for rejecting **kenosis theories** and defending the classical doctrine of the **hypostatic union**. Their clear articulation of the distinction and unity of Christ’s two natures has influenced confessional Reformed and Presbyterian traditions globally. The Standards remain a touchstone for evaluating contemporary Christological proposals, ensuring fidelity to the historic doctrine of Christ’s unchanging deity.
