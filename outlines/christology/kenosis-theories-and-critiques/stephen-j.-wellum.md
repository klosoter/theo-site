# Stephen J. Wellum (1961– )

Stephen J. Wellum is a contemporary evangelical theologian who robustly critiques **kenosis theories** in Christology, insisting on the necessity of maintaining **Chalcedonian categories** and the **immutability** of the divine nature. Wellum contends that kenotic models undermine the classical doctrine of the **hypostatic union** by suggesting that the Son divested himself of divine attributes, thereby threatening the integrity of both **Christ’s deity and humanity**.

- "Kenotic Christology, in seeking to make sense of the incarnation, ultimately fails to preserve the biblical and orthodox teaching that the Son remains fully God while also becoming fully man." (God the Son Incarnate, p. 330)

## Key Works

- God the Son Incarnate: The Doctrine of Christ (2016)
- "Kenoticism and Christology: Evaluating Contemporary Proposals" in The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology (2011)
- The Person of Christ: An Introduction (2016, with Malcolm B. Yarnell III)
- Christ Alone: The Uniqueness of Jesus as Savior (2017)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Upholding the Hypostatic Union**
   - Affirms that Jesus Christ is one person in two natures, fully divine and fully human.
   - Rejects any division or confusion between the divine and human natures.
   - Insists that the **Son’s divine attributes** are retained in the incarnation.
   - Maintains that the **Chalcedonian Definition** is the non-negotiable boundary for orthodox Christology.
   "The hypostatic union means that the Son does not divest himself of deity but adds a human nature to himself." (God the Son Incarnate, p. 331)

2. **Critique of Kenotic Theories**
   - Argues that kenosis theories misinterpret Philippians 2:6–8 as implying a loss or limitation of divine attributes.
   - Sees kenoticism as incompatible with the **immutability** and **aseity** of God.
   - Claims that kenotic models collapse the distinction between Creator and creature.
   - Warns that such theories risk a functional or ontological subordination within the Trinity.
   "Kenoticism, in the end, cannot do justice to the biblical presentation of Christ as truly God and truly man." (God the Son Incarnate, p. 334)

3. **Scriptural Exegesis of Philippians 2**
   - Interprets "emptied himself" (ekenōsen) as a metaphor for **humiliation** and **servanthood**, not a literal surrender of divine attributes.
   - Emphasizes the context of **incarnational humility** rather than ontological change.
   - Argues that the passage affirms Christ’s preexistence and equality with God.
   - Maintains that the text upholds the continuity of the Son’s deity throughout the incarnation.
   "Paul’s point is not that the Son ceases to be God, but that he humbles himself by taking on our humanity." (God the Son Incarnate, p. 332)

4. **Divine Immutability and Impassibility**
   - Asserts that the divine nature cannot change or suffer loss of attributes.
   - Holds that the incarnation is an act of addition (assumption of humanity), not subtraction.
   - Defends the classical attributes of God as essential for a coherent doctrine of Christ.
   - Rejects any Christology that implies mutability or passibility in the divine essence.
   "To say that the Son gives up his divine attributes is to deny the very nature of God." (God the Son Incarnate, p. 333)

5. **Reformed and Classical Christology**
   - Aligns with **Reformed orthodoxy** and the **Great Tradition** on Christ’s person and work.
   - Emphasizes the necessity of **conciliar Christology** for maintaining biblical fidelity.
   - Sees the **extra Calvinisticum** as a safeguard against kenotic errors.
   - Argues that only a classical approach preserves the integrity of the gospel.
   "The Reformed tradition rightly insists that the Son remains fully God even as he becomes fully man for our salvation." (God the Son Incarnate, p. 335)

## Legacy and Impact

Stephen J. Wellum has become a leading evangelical voice in defending **classical Christology** against modern revisions such as kenosis theories. His work has reinforced the importance of the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the classical attributes of God within contemporary evangelical theology. Wellum’s careful exegesis and theological clarity have shaped current discussions on the person of Christ, ensuring that the integrity of both Christ’s deity and humanity remains central in orthodox confession. His critiques continue to influence both academic and ecclesial conversations on the doctrine of the incarnation.
