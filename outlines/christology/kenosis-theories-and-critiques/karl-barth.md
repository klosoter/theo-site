# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth decisively rejected classical **kenosis theories** that posited a self-emptying of the divine nature in the **incarnation**. Instead, he emphasized the **unity of the person of Christ** and the **sovereign freedom of God**, insisting that in Jesus Christ, God remains fully God while truly becoming human. Barth’s approach reframes kenosis as an act of divine condescension without any loss or limitation of **divine attributes**.

- "God does not give up being God in becoming man, but in becoming man He proves that He is God." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Classical Kenosis**
    - Barth opposes any notion that the Son relinquished divine attributes in the incarnation.
    - He maintains that **divine immutability** is not compromised by the incarnation.
    - Kenosis is interpreted as a mode of divine action, not a subtraction of deity.
    - The incarnation is a sovereign act of God’s freedom, not a limitation.
    - "The self-emptying of the Son is not a surrender of His divinity, but its deepest revelation." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Unity of Christ’s Person**
    - Barth insists on the inseparability of the divine and human natures in Christ.
    - The person of Christ is the locus of both natures without confusion or division.
    - Kenosis is understood within the context of the hypostatic union.
    - The divine initiative preserves the integrity of both natures.
    - "In Jesus Christ, true God and true man are one person." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

3. **Divine Freedom and Sovereignty**
    - God’s becoming human is an act of free grace, not necessity.
    - The incarnation is a demonstration of God’s lordship, not a limitation.
    - Barth emphasizes that God is never subject to external constraints.
    - Kenosis is the expression of God’s freedom to be for us in Christ.
    - "God is free to be God in the way He Himself wills." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

4. **Revelation of God’s Humility**
    - Barth sees kenosis as the supreme revelation of God’s humility and love.
    - The incarnation is the self-humbling of God for the sake of humanity.
    - This humility does not entail a loss of divine majesty.
    - God’s condescension is a positive act, not a negative subtraction.
    - "God’s majesty is shown precisely in His humility." (The Humanity of God)

5. **Critique of Speculative Christology**
    - Barth warns against speculative attempts to define the mechanics of kenosis.
    - He prioritizes the biblical witness over philosophical speculation.
    - The mystery of the incarnation is to be confessed, not dissected.
    - Barth’s method is Christocentric, focusing on the revealed Christ.
    - "We must not attempt to explain away the mystery of Christ’s person." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s critique of **kenosis theories** has shaped modern Christology by reasserting the full deity and humanity of Christ without compromise. His emphasis on the **sovereign freedom of God** and the unity of Christ’s person remains influential in both Reformed and ecumenical theology. Barth’s approach continues to challenge speculative and reductionist accounts of the incarnation, calling theologians to a more biblically grounded and doxological confession of Christ.
