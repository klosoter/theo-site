# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner engaged **kenosis theories** primarily through his doctrine of the **incarnation** and the **self-communication of God**. He critiqued classical kenoticism for risking a division within the **Trinity** and instead emphasized the unity of **Christ’s divine and human natures** within the framework of **transcendental Christology**.

- "The Logos does not cease to be God in becoming man, but he becomes man in such a way that his divinity is not abolished but is the very ground of his humanity." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Foundations of Christian Faith
- Theological Investigations, Vol. 1: God, Christ, Mary and Grace
- Theological Investigations, Vol. 4: More Recent Writings
- Theological Investigations, Vol. 17: Jesus, Man, and the Church
- Christology within an Evolutionary View of the World

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Literal Kenosis**
    - Argues that **kenosis** cannot mean a real surrender or loss of divine attributes.
    - Maintains that the **Logos** remains fully divine even in the incarnation.
    - Sees literal kenoticism as threatening the unity of the **Trinitarian persons**.
    - Emphasizes the communicatio idiomatum as a safeguard against division.
    - "The self-emptying of Christ does not mean the Logos ceases to be God." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 1)

2. **Transcendental Christology**
    - Christ’s humanity is the concrete realization of God’s self-communication.
    - The incarnation is understood as God’s presence in human history, not a subtraction of divinity.
    - Human nature is elevated, not diminished, by the union with the divine.
    - The mystery of Christ is rooted in the existential structure of human openness to God.
    - "The humanity of Jesus is the real symbol of God’s self-communication." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Unity of Divine and Human Natures**
    - Stresses the hypostatic union without confusion or separation.
    - The divine and human natures coexist in the one person of Christ.
    - Rejects any model that would suggest a change in the divine essence.
    - The incarnation is a unique event, not a metaphysical transformation.
    - "The union of the two natures in Christ is not a mixture, but a personal unity." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)

4. **Kenosis as Revelation of Divine Love**
    - Sees kenosis as the expression of God’s self-giving love, not a metaphysical loss.
    - The cross is the ultimate manifestation of divine self-communication.
    - God’s humility is revealed in Christ’s obedience and suffering.
    - The self-emptying is a mode of presence, not absence, of divinity.
    - "Kenosis is the revelation of God’s love, not the renunciation of divinity." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Critique of Classical Kenoticism**
    - Classical kenoticism risks undermining the immutability of God.
    - Warns against any Christology that divides the divine and human in Christ.
    - Advocates for a dynamic, relational understanding of the incarnation.
    - Emphasizes the mystery and paradox of the God-man.
    - "A kenosis which would mean the Logos ceases to be God is theologically impossible." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s critique of **kenosis theories** has shaped modern Catholic and ecumenical Christology, steering discussions away from literalist interpretations toward a focus on the **self-communication of God**. His emphasis on the unity of Christ’s natures and the transcendental approach to the incarnation has influenced both systematic theology and contemporary debates on the meaning of divine self-emptying. Rahner’s work remains a touchstone for theologians seeking to articulate the mystery of Christ without compromising the integrity of the **Trinity** or the fullness of the divine nature.
