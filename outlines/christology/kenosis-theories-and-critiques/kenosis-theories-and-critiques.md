### TITLE
Emptying Without Loss: Kenosis under Chalcedonian Constraint

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Late antique to modern debates located in Christology and Theology Proper, climaxing in the nineteenth century and revisited in twentieth and twenty-first century analytic retrievals of **divine immutability** and **impassibility**.
- Core question: What does the Son empty in Philippians 2, and can any **kenosis** be affirmed without loss of **full deity**.
- Principal figures and schools: **Cyril of Alexandria** as patristic anchor, **Chalcedon 451** as normative boundary, **Thomasius and Gess** as modern kenotic innovators, **Hodge, Warfield, Bavinck** as Reformed critics, **Rahner and Balthasar** as Roman Catholic reframers, **Morris and Crisp** as analytic clarifiers.
- Key concepts and loci connections: **extra Calvinisticum**, **communication of idioms**, **two wills and two minds**, **divine simplicity**, **Rahners Rule**, and **kenosis by addition** rather than subtraction.
- Major texts and events: Philippians 2.5–11, John 1.14, Colossians 2.9, Mark 13.32; **Council of Chalcedon 451**, **Constantinople III 680–681**, nineteenth century German kenoticism 1853–1861, **Westminster Confession 1646–1647**.
- Reformed and alternative trajectories: Reformed affirm **assumption not conversion** and **Calvins autotheos**, while Lutheran and modern kenotic strands explore a **genus maiestaticum** and qualified self-limitation.
- Legacy cue: Continuing debate over **functional kenosis** versus **ontological kenosis**, and retrieval of classical theism in dialogue with contemporary concerns about divine humility and suffering.

### ESSAY 1500-1800 words.
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
Kenosis names the Son's self-emptying in Philippians 2, expressed by the verb *ekenosen*, often taken to imply a deliberate condescension. The dogmatic question is whether this **kenosis** entails any diminution of the Son's deity, or whether it is a mode of manifestation and mission compatible with **divine immutability**. In classic terms, the Incarnation is a union of two natures in the one hypostasis of the Son, secured by the **Chalcedonian Definition**, which rules out change, confusion, division, or separation.

Dogmatically we locate kenosis at the nexus of Christology and Theology Proper, where talk of the Son's mission must not invert **Rahners Rule** by collapsing the immanent into the economic. Kenosis thus concerns how the eternal Son, remaining what he is, truly becomes what he was not, which the Reformed name **assumption not conversion**, and which the tradition explicates through **communication of idioms** and the logic of enhypostatic union.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
Philippians 2.5–11 is the decisive text. The Son, being in *morphe theou*, did not regard equality with God a thing to be exploited, but he *heauton ekenosen*, taking the *morphe doulou*, being made in human likeness, humbling himself to death, even a cross. Exegetically the emptying accents status and vocation, not subtraction of divinity, since the movement is from **glory to servanthood** by addition of a servant form. The hymn concludes with exaltation and the Lordship confession that fulfills Isaiah 45, reinforcing **full deity** rather than an ontological diminishment.

Other texts reinforce this pattern. John 1.14 declares the Word became flesh, while Colossians 2.9 affirms that in him all the fullness of deity dwells bodily, a strong bulwark against **ontological kenosis**. Mark 13.32 and Luke 2.52 display genuine human limitations, which the tradition reads through **two minds and two wills**, secured at Constantinople III in 680 to 681, without negating **divine omniscience**. Second Corinthians 8.9 captures the logic of redemptive poverty, and Hebrews 2 and 5 insist on solidarity and obedience, yielding a biblical portrait of **functional kenosis** that is covenantal and soteriological.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
The fathers framed kenosis within the larger struggle to confess one Lord Jesus Christ who is both fully God and fully man. **Cyril of Alexandria** insisted the Word appropriates human experiences as his own without change in the divine nature, and **Leo's Tome** articulated the pattern of each nature performing what is proper in communion of the one person, later codified at **Chalcedon 451**. The result is a grammar in which self-emptying is the descent of the Son by way of **assumption**, not the forfeiture of divine predicates.

Medieval scholasticism refined this account. **Thomas Aquinas** taught the union as a **supposital union**, with the person of the Word as subject of all the incarnate acts, denying any loss of **divine simplicity** while affirming real human growth and suffering. Reformation debates refracted the issue through the **communication of idioms**, with Lutheran accounts emphasizing a **genus maiestaticum** in which divine majesty can be communicated to the humanity, and Reformed accounts stressing the **extra Calvinisticum**, the confession that the Word remains infinite and not circumscribed by the flesh even while truly united.

A genuine shift occurs in the nineteenth century. Under the pressures of modern historical consciousness and idealism, **G. Thomasius** between 1853 and 1861 and **W. F. Gess** in 1856 proposed forms of **ontological kenosis**, in which the Logos relinquishes the use or even possession of certain divine attributes during the earthly life. In Britain, **Charles Gore** in 1889 and **P. T. Forsyth** in 1909 attempted constructive kenoses that protect piety and moral seriousness while courting tension with **immutability**. Twentieth century Roman Catholics like **Karl Rahner** and **Hans Urs von Balthasar** reframed kenosis as intra-Trinitarian self-donation, yet many warned that **Rahners Rule** does not authorize ontic change in God.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
Reformed theology received Philippians 2 as a hymn of humiliation by assumption. **Old Princeton** voices such as **Charles Hodge** in his Systematic Theology of 1872 to 1873 and **B. B. Warfield** in essays later gathered in 1912 argue that the Son empties himself not by subtraction of deity but by taking the form of a servant, the classic **kenosis by addition**. Warfield weds this to a high view of **divine impassibility**, insisting that the person of the Son can suffer in his assumed human nature without implicating change in the divine nature.

The **Dutch Neo-Calvinist** stream is equally clarifying. **Herman Bavinck** in Reformed Dogmatics between 1895 and 1901 synthesizes patristic and Reformed insights, reaffirming the **extra Calvinisticum** and **Calvins autotheos** while showing that the Incarnation is the highest revelation of **divine humility** precisely because God remains God. Confessionally, the **Westminster Standards 1646 to 1647** codify that the mediator is one person in two whole perfect natures, without conversion or composition, and Article 18 of the **Belgic Confession 1561** insists the Son truly assumed a real human nature. These documents anchor the Reformed critique of **ontological kenosis** and commend a robust **functional kenosis**.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
Roman Catholic accounts classically follow **Aquinas**. The unity is at the level of supposit, so the divine person is the subject of all actions, while the natures remain intact, preserving **divine simplicity**. Modern Catholic voices such as **Rahner** and **Balthasar** deploy language of **Trinitarian kenosis** to express eternal self-giving, yet authoritative Catholic theology resists any claim that God ceases to be omniscient or immutable, construing kenosis as revelatory veiling rather than ontic reduction.

Lutheranism holds the **genus maiestaticum** within the communication of idioms, at times speaking of the humanity's participation in divine majesty. Nineteenth century **kenotic Lutherans** like Thomasius represent a departure from confessional Lutheranism, proposing that the Logos laid aside the use of certain attributes, in order to secure Christ's genuine historical consciousness. Classical Lutheran dogmatics, however, as in **Martin Chemnitz**, harmonize **two wills** and **two states** without affirming a real divestment of deity, aiming to protect both the cross and the sacraments.

Modern constructive theologians also use kenosis to narrate divine solidarity. Some **process kenosis** and **open theism** proposals make divine self-limitation constitutive of God's being, thereby revising **divine immutability**. By contrast, analytic theologians like **Thomas V. Morris** in 1986, **Oliver D. Crisp** in 2007, and **Timothy Pawl** in 2016 defend conciliar orthodoxy through a **two-minds model** and **qua-operator** analysis, yielding a **functional kenosis** of willed nonuse that is compatible with **immutability**. Crisp speaks of **kerygmatic kenosis**, the announcement that the Son refrains from exercising some divine prerogatives in the economy, while retaining them *ad intra*.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
A first debate concerns the coherence of any kenosis with **divine simplicity** and **impassibility**. Critics argue that a God who can set aside omniscience or omnipotence is no longer the God of Scripture and classical theism. Responses insist on **willed nonuse** rather than loss, grounding the distinction in the asymmetry between the **ad intra** life and the **ad extra** missions, thus honoring **Rahners Rule** without collapsing essence into economy.

A second debate concerns exegesis. Is *ekenosen* a metaphysical claim or a narrative of status reversal. The pattern of descent and ascent in Philippians 2 and the insistence of Colossians 2.9 and Hebrews 1 toward **full deity** favor a **functional kenosis**. Yet the real human ignorance signaled in Mark 13.32 presses models to account for authentic human epistemic limits. Here **two-minds models** and **anhypostasia and enhypostasia** offer grammar that explains growth and ignorance in Christ's human mind without denying **divine omniscience**.

A third debate engages theodicy and divine suffering. Some insist only a God who can truly suffer in the divine nature can save, deploying **kenotic theopaschism**. Classical voices respond that the person who is God truly suffers in his human nature, so the pathos is personal yet does not violate **impassibility**. The cross thus reveals **divine love** without metaphysical change, maintaining the coherence of worship and providence.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
Trinitarianly, kenosis is the economic form of the Son's mission from the Father in the Spirit, a temporal expression of eternal **filiation and procession**. The axiom that the external works of the Trinity are indivisible means the Father's sending, the Son's self-emptying, and the Spirit's anointing are one operation with distinct hypostatic appropriations. This guards **divine simplicity** while explicating the particular **obedience of the Son** in the Incarnation.

Anthropologically and soteriologically, kenosis binds Christ's humility to Adamic reversal. The Son assumes a fallen-beset yet sinless human nature, entering the arena of **temptation and obedience**, recapitulating human history in fidelity. The **two wills** affirmed in 680 to 681 secure the reality of vicarious obedience, while the **extra Calvinisticum** preserves the transcendent efficacy of the Mediator who remains Lord of glory. Eschatologically, the exaltation of Philippians 2 culminates in universal acknowledgment of **Jesus as Lord**, integrating humiliation and glorification into a single economy of salvation.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastorally, a classical **functional kenosis** grounds comfort and imitation without metaphysical compromise. Believers confess a Lord who truly knew hunger, ignorance, and sorrow in his human life, yet whose **divine faithfulness** secures redemption. This underwrites doxology in Holy Week, where the Philippians hymn is sung as the pattern of divine humility and triumph.

Ethically, kenosis shapes cruciform discipleship as **service without servility**, authorizing self-giving that images the Son's descent while refusing the theological misuse of kenosis to justify oppression or abuse. Liturgically, the Church prays to one person in two natures, confident that the **communication of idioms** legitimates addressing the crucified as the Lord of glory and the exalted one as the suffering servant who still ministers by the Spirit.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
Rightly ordered, **kenosis by addition** secures the gospel's humble splendor by confessing that the Son of God, without ceasing to be what he is, truly became what he was not for us and for our salvation, preserving **divine immutability** while accomplishing real **redemptive humiliation**.
