# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper critiqued **kenosis theories** as incompatible with orthodox **Christology**, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining both the **immutability** and **full deity** of Christ during the **Incarnation**. He argued that any notion of the Son divesting Himself of divine attributes undermines the unity of the **two natures** in the one **Person of Christ** and threatens the integrity of **Reformed confessional standards**.

- "If Christ had truly laid aside His divine attributes, He would have ceased to be God, and the Incarnation would be a contradiction." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Key Works

- Dictaten Dogmatiek (unpublished lectures, referenced in secondary literature)
- Abraham Kuyper: A Centennial Reader (ed. Bratt, selections on Christology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
   - God’s **immutability** is essential and cannot be compromised in the Incarnation.
   - Kenosis theories threaten the unchangeableness of the divine essence.
   - Christ’s divine attributes remain fully operative, though not always manifest.
   - Any "emptying" refers to the mode of existence, not the essence or attributes.
   - "The divine nature cannot be subject to change or limitation, even in the mystery of the Incarnation." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
   - Christ is one **Person** with two distinct natures, divine and human.
   - Kenosis theories risk dividing the Person or subordinating the divine to the human.
   - The **hypostatic union** is maintained without confusion, change, division, or separation.
   - The full deity and full humanity of Christ are both essential for redemption.
   - "The unity of Christ’s person is not preserved if the divine nature is diminished or set aside." (E Voto Dordraceno)

3. **Rejection of Attribute Surrender**
   - The Son does not surrender or suspend divine attributes in the Incarnation.
   - Kenotic models misinterpret Philippians 2:7, which refers to humility, not ontological change.
   - Divine omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence remain intact in Christ.
   - The self-emptying is a veiling, not a relinquishing, of divine prerogatives.
   - "The so-called kenosis is a self-humbling, not a self-limiting of the divine being." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

4. **Fidelity to Reformed Confessions**
   - Kuyper insists on alignment with the **Chalcedonian Definition** and Reformed standards.
   - Kenosis theories are seen as deviations from historic confessional Christology.
   - The Belgic Confession and Heidelberg Catechism affirm the full deity of Christ at all times.
   - Doctrinal innovation in Christology is viewed with suspicion and caution.
   - "Our confessions do not permit the notion that Christ ever ceased to be fully God." (E Voto Dordraceno)

5. **Redemptive Necessity of the True God-Man**
   - Only one who is truly God and truly man can mediate between God and humanity.
   - Kenosis undermines the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement by compromising His deity.
   - The efficacy of redemption depends on the unbroken possession of divine attributes.
   - The Incarnation is a mystery to be confessed, not rationalized through speculative theories.
   - "If Christ were less than fully God, He could not be the Savior of sinners." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust critique of **kenosis theories** reinforced the boundaries of orthodox **Reformed Christology** in the face of modern theological trends. His insistence on the **immutability** and full deity of Christ shaped subsequent Reformed responses to kenotic speculation. Kuyper’s influence persists in confessional circles that uphold the classical doctrine of the **hypostatic union** and resist attempts to reinterpret the Incarnation in ways that compromise the integrity of Christ’s person and work.
