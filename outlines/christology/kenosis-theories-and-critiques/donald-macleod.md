# Donald Macleod (1940–2023)

Donald Macleod was a leading Reformed theologian who offered a robust critique of **kenosis theories** regarding the **person of Christ**. He argued that such theories undermine the **immutability** and **full deity** of Christ by positing a real surrender or limitation of divine attributes in the **incarnation**.

- "The kenotic theory is not so much an explanation of the Incarnation as a redefinition of God." ("The Person of Christ")

## Key Works

- The Person of Christ (1998)
- Jesus is Lord: Christology Yesterday and Today (1982)
- "Kenotic Christology: A Survey and Critique" (in various theological journals)
- A Faith to Live By (1998)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Unchanged Divine Nature**
    - Christ’s **divine attributes** remain fully intact during the incarnation.
    - Any theory suggesting Christ “gave up” divine properties is inconsistent with **orthodox Christology**.
    - The **immutability** of God is non-negotiable in Christian doctrine.
    - Kenosis theories risk reducing Christ to a superhuman rather than truly **God incarnate**.
    - "If Christ ceases to be what God is, then the Incarnation is not God with us." (The Person of Christ)

2. **Rejection of Literal Kenosis**
    - Kenosis is a metaphorical, not ontological, description of Christ’s self-emptying.
    - The **Philippians 2** passage refers to Christ’s humility and status, not a loss of deity.
    - Literal kenosis undermines the **hypostatic union**.
    - The Son’s self-limitation is functional, not essential.
    - "Kenosis, properly understood, is not the surrender of deity but the assumption of servanthood." (The Person of Christ)

3. **Defense of the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ is one person in two natures: fully **God** and fully **man**.
    - The natures are united without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - Kenotic theories threaten this union by altering the divine nature.
    - The **Chalcedonian Definition** is the standard for Christological orthodoxy.
    - "The hypostatic union is not negotiable; it is the very heart of the Incarnation." (The Person of Christ)

4. **Emphasis on Scriptural Authority**
    - Christological formulations must be governed by **biblical revelation**.
    - Kenosis theories often rely on philosophical speculation rather than exegesis.
    - The New Testament consistently affirms Christ’s full deity and humanity.
    - The **self-emptying** of Christ is best understood through the lens of redemptive history.
    - "Scripture never presents Christ as less than God, even in his humiliation." (Jesus is Lord)

5. **Christ’s Humiliation as Functional, Not Ontological**
    - Christ’s “emptying” refers to his taking the form of a servant, not surrendering divine attributes.
    - The **humiliation** is about status and experience, not essence.
    - The Son voluntarily refrains from independent use of divine prerogatives.
    - The incarnation is an addition (of humanity), not a subtraction (of deity).
    - "The humiliation of Christ is a matter of addition, not subtraction." (The Person of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Macleod’s critique of **kenosis theories** has shaped contemporary Reformed and evangelical Christology, reinforcing the centrality of the **hypostatic union** and the unchangeable deity of Christ. His work remains a standard reference for those defending classical formulations against modern reinterpretations. By grounding his arguments in both **Scripture** and historic creeds, Macleod has provided a robust framework for evaluating Christological proposals in the modern era.
