# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **kenosis theories** with significant caution, critiquing any view that compromises the full **deity** or **immutability** of Christ in the **incarnation**. He insists that the Son’s self-emptying in Philippians 2 should be understood as a **functional** and **relational** act, not an ontological reduction of divine attributes. Frame’s analysis is rooted in a robust **Reformed Christology** that upholds the unity of Christ’s **person** and the integrity of both **natures**.

- "The kenosis theory, if it means that Christ gave up any divine attributes, is incompatible with orthodox Christology." (The Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- "The Incarnation and Kenosis" (in Contemporary Theological Issues, various essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Deity Remains Intact**
    - Christ did not surrender any essential **divine attributes** in the incarnation.
    - The **Son** remains fully God even as he assumes a human nature.
    - Any theory suggesting loss of omniscience, omnipotence, or omnipresence is rejected.
    - The **immutability** of God is preserved in Christ’s person.
    - "If Christ ceased to be God in any respect, he could not be the Savior." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Kenosis as Functional, Not Ontological**
    - The "emptying" in Philippians 2 refers to Christ’s **humiliation** and servant role.
    - Frame interprets kenosis as a **voluntary non-use** of certain divine prerogatives.
    - The Son’s self-limitation is an act of **obedience**, not a change in essence.
    - Christ’s divine nature remains fully operative, though not always manifest.
    - "Kenosis is not subtraction of deity, but addition of humanity." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Rejection of Classical Kenotic Theories**
    - Frame critiques 19th-century kenoticism for undermining **orthodox Christology**.
    - He warns against any division or separation in the **person of Christ**.
    - Kenotic theories often fail to account for the **Chalcedonian Definition**.
    - The unity of Christ’s person is central to Frame’s critique.
    - "Kenotic theories tend to divide Christ into two persons, which is heretical." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Scriptural Authority in Christological Formulation**
    - Frame insists that all Christological doctrine must be grounded in **Scripture**.
    - He critiques speculative approaches that go beyond biblical revelation.
    - The meaning of "emptied himself" must be exegetically determined.
    - Frame upholds the sufficiency and clarity of **biblical teaching** on the incarnation.
    - "We must not let philosophical speculation override the plain teaching of Scripture." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Creator-Creature Distinction Maintained**
    - The incarnation does not blur the line between **Creator** and **creature**.
    - Christ’s human nature is a true addition, not a transformation of deity.
    - Frame emphasizes the **mystery** of the incarnation without compromising divine transcendence.
    - The Son’s condescension is an act of grace, not a loss of divinity.
    - "The incarnation is the Creator coming to us as creature, not ceasing to be Creator." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s critique of **kenosis theories** has reinforced a high view of Christ’s deity and the **immutability** of God within contemporary Reformed theology. His insistence on **Scriptural authority** and the unity of Christ’s person has shaped evangelical responses to modern Christological errors. Frame’s work continues to serve as a bulwark against speculative and revisionist approaches to the incarnation, ensuring that the church’s confession remains rooted in biblical orthodoxy.
