# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **kenosis theories** through his program of **demythologization**, emphasizing the existential significance of Christ rather than metaphysical explanations of the Incarnation. He critiqued traditional **kenotic Christology** as rooted in mythological categories, arguing that the New Testament’s message is best understood through the lens of **existential encounter** rather than ontological speculation about Christ’s self-emptying.

- "The real question is not how the divine can become human, but what it means for us that God has acted in Christ." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Key Works

- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Kerygma and Myth (1941, ed. Hans Werner Bartsch)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Kenosis**
   - Interprets **kenosis** as mythological language expressing existential truth.
   - Rejects literal readings of Christ’s self-emptying as metaphysical events.
   - Sees myth as a vehicle for existential meaning, not ontological description.
   - Calls for translating kenotic language into existential categories.
   - "Mythological statements about Christ must be interpreted existentially." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Christ**
   - Focuses on the **kerygma** as the proclamation of Christ’s significance.
   - Christ’s self-emptying is understood as the call to authentic existence.
   - Downplays metaphysical speculation in favor of personal encounter.
   - Emphasizes the transformative impact of the Christ event.
   - "The Christ who meets us in the kerygma is the Christ who calls us to decision." (Kerygma and Myth)

3. **Critique of Metaphysical Christology**
   - Argues that metaphysical kenosis theories are foreign to the New Testament.
   - Claims early Christian proclamation is not concerned with ontological states.
   - Sees traditional kenotic debates as distractions from the gospel’s existential demand.
   - Advocates for a focus on faith’s response rather than metaphysical explanation.
   - "The New Testament does not speculate about the metaphysical nature of Christ’s being." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Centrality of Faith and Decision**
   - Stresses the necessity of existential response to the **kerygma**.
   - Kenosis is meaningful only as it confronts the hearer with a call to faith.
   - The self-emptying of Christ is paradigmatic for authentic human existence.
   - Faith is not assent to doctrine but existential trust and obedience.
   - "Faith is decision, not assent to mythological propositions." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Historical-Critical Method**
   - Applies rigorous historical criticism to kenotic passages (e.g., Philippians 2).
   - Distinguishes between mythological expression and historical fact.
   - Seeks to uncover the existential message behind the text.
   - Maintains that kenosis language reflects early Christian experience, not metaphysics.
   - "The historical-critical method frees us from the bondage of mythological thinking." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **kenosis** profoundly shaped modern theology’s engagement with the Incarnation, shifting the focus from metaphysical speculation to existential interpretation. His **demythologization** program influenced generations of scholars to reconsider the meaning and function of kenotic language in the New Testament. While his critiques sparked significant debate, especially among those committed to classical Christology, his insistence on the existential significance of Christ remains a major reference point in contemporary theological discussions.
