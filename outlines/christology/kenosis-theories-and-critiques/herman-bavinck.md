# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck firmly rejected **kenosis theories** that posit the Son’s self-emptying involved the surrender or limitation of divine attributes in the **incarnation**. He insisted on the **immutability** and **impassibility** of the divine nature, maintaining that the **two natures of Christ** remain distinct and united without confusion or change. For Bavinck, any theory that compromises the **full deity of Christ** undermines the heart of **Reformed Christology**.

- "The kenosis theory, in all its forms, does not do justice to the unchangeableness of God and the unity of the person of Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- The Wonderful Works of God
- "The Doctrine of God" (in Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)
- "The Person of Christ" (various lectures and essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Immutability Maintained**
    - God’s **attributes** cannot be set aside or diminished, even in the incarnation.
    - The divine nature of the Son remains fully intact and unchanged.
    - Any suggestion of change in God is incompatible with classical theism.
    - The **kenosis theory** risks introducing mutability into the Godhead.
    - "God cannot cease to be God, not even in the incarnation." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **True Union of Two Natures**
    - Christ is one person in two natures, divine and human, without confusion or separation.
    - The incarnation is a union, not a transformation or reduction of deity.
    - The divine nature does not become human, nor does the human become divine.
    - Kenosis theories blur the distinction and unity of the two natures.
    - "The incarnation is not a metamorphosis of God into a human being, but the assumption of human nature into union with the divine." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Full Deity and Full Humanity of Christ**
    - Christ retains the **fullness of deity** while assuming true humanity.
    - The Son’s self-emptying refers to his **humiliation** and acceptance of human limitations, not the loss of divine attributes.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is upheld without mixing or diminishing the natures.
    - Kenosis theories threaten the reality of Christ’s divine personhood.
    - "He did not divest himself of his divine nature, but took the form of a servant." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Scriptural and Historical Critique of Kenosis**
    - Bavinck appeals to the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the standard for orthodox Christology.
    - He argues that kenosis theories lack clear biblical support.
    - The historic church consistently rejected any diminution of Christ’s deity.
    - Kenosis is seen as a modern innovation incompatible with the **ecumenical creeds**.
    - "The church has always confessed that the Logos remained what he was, even when he became flesh." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Redemptive Necessity of the Unchanged Divine Son**
    - Only the unaltered, divine Son can accomplish true redemption.
    - The efficacy of Christ’s work depends on his full deity and humanity.
    - Kenosis undermines the basis for **atonement** and **mediation**.
    - The unchanging God alone can bridge the gap between God and humanity.
    - "If Christ were not truly God, he could not be our Savior." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust critique of **kenosis theories** has shaped modern Reformed responses to nineteenth- and twentieth-century Christological innovations. His insistence on the **immutability of God** and the integrity of the **two natures of Christ** remains a standard reference in systematic theology. Bavinck’s careful engagement with both Scripture and tradition continues to inform contemporary debates on the person and work of Christ. His work upholds the centrality of Christ’s full deity for the coherence and power of the gospel.
