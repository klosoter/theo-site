# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a staunch critic of **kenosis theories**, which propose that Christ emptied Himself of certain divine attributes in the **Incarnation**. Warfield defended the **immutability** and **full deity** of Christ, insisting that any diminution of divine attributes undermines the orthodox doctrine of the **hypostatic union**. He maintained that the **person of Christ** remains fully God and fully man, without confusion or division.

- "The kenotic theory is, in reality, a theory of the abandonment of the divine by the divine person." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

## Key Works

- "The Person and Work of Christ" (1902)
- "The Emotional Life of Our Lord" (1912)
- "The Divine and Human in the Person of Christ" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Two Natures in Christ" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Supernatural Birth of Jesus" (in Selected Shorter Writings)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
   - God’s **attributes** cannot be surrendered or diminished, even in the Incarnation.
   - Any theory that posits a change in the divine nature is fundamentally unorthodox.
   - The divine and human natures in Christ remain distinct yet united in one person.
   - The **immutability** of God is essential for the reliability of **revelation** and **redemption**.
   - "God cannot cease to be God, nor can any of His attributes be laid aside, even temporarily." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

2. **Rejection of Kenotic Christology**
   - Kenosis theories misinterpret Philippians 2:7 and the meaning of "emptied Himself."
   - Warfield argued that Christ’s "emptying" refers to taking on the form of a servant, not relinquishing deity.
   - Kenosis undermines the **hypostatic union** by dividing or diminishing Christ’s divine nature.
   - Orthodox Christology maintains the full possession of divine attributes during the Incarnation.
   - "The kenotic theory is not an explanation of the Incarnation, but a denial of it." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

3. **Orthodox Understanding of the Hypostatic Union**
   - Christ is one person in two complete natures: fully God and fully man.
   - The union of natures is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
   - The divine nature is not altered or limited by the human nature.
   - The **Chalcedonian Definition** is the standard for orthodox Christology.
   - "The two natures are united in one person, but neither is changed or diminished by the union." ("The Two Natures in Christ")

4. **Scriptural Authority in Christological Formulation**
   - Warfield insisted on interpreting key texts (e.g., Philippians 2) within the broader scriptural witness.
   - He rejected speculative theology not grounded in the **inerrant Scriptures**.
   - The Bible presents Christ as fully divine and fully human, without contradiction.
   - Doctrinal formulations must be controlled by the **biblical data**.
   - "We must let the Scriptures speak, not our philosophical preferences." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

5. **Soteriological Necessity of Christ’s Full Deity**
   - Only a fully divine Christ can accomplish **atonement** and secure salvation.
   - Kenosis theories threaten the sufficiency and efficacy of Christ’s redemptive work.
   - The mediator must be both God and man to reconcile God and humanity.
   - The integrity of the gospel depends on the unabridged deity of Christ.
   - "If Christ is not truly God, He cannot save; if He is not truly man, He cannot represent us." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **immutability** and full deity of Christ decisively shaped Reformed responses to kenosis theories in the twentieth century. His work reinforced the centrality of the **hypostatic union** and the authority of Scripture in Christological debates. Warfield’s critiques remain a standard reference for those upholding classical Christology against modernist reinterpretations. His legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of orthodox doctrines concerning the person and work of Christ.
