# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classical **Reformed Christology** that affirms the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ while rejecting any notion that the Son divested Himself of divine attributes in the **Incarnation**. These confessions stand in clear opposition to **kenosis theories**, emphasizing the **immutability** and **impassibility** of the divine nature and the **communicatio idiomatum** as the proper framework for understanding the union of natures in Christ.

- "For since the divine nature always remained unchangeable, He retained it even while He was in the womb of the virgin." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, especially Articles 18–19
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Days 14–16
- Canons of Dort, Second Head of Doctrine, Articles 3–4
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard collected editions)
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unchanging Divine Nature in the Incarnation**
   - Christ’s **divine nature** is united to human nature without change, mixture, or confusion.
   - The Son did not surrender or limit any divine attributes in becoming man.
   - The **immutability** of God is explicitly affirmed against all forms of kenotic Christology.
   - The Incarnation is a union of two natures, not a transformation or reduction of the divine.
   - "For the divine nature was always unchangeably in Him, even when He lay in the manger and hung upon the cross." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

2. **True and Complete Humanity of Christ**
   - Christ assumed a real human nature, with body and soul, like ours in all things except sin.
   - The human nature is not deified or absorbed by the divine, nor is the divine diminished.
   - The **two natures** remain distinct, each retaining its own properties.
   - The union is personal (hypostatic), not essential or accidental.
   - "He is true and eternal God, and also true man, truly our Immanuel." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

3. **Rejection of Eutychianism and Nestorianism**
   - The confessions explicitly reject any confusion, change, division, or separation of the natures.
   - Kenosis theories are seen as a modern form of ancient Christological errors.
   - The **communicatio idiomatum** is affirmed: properties of each nature are ascribed to the one Person.
   - The unity of Person is maintained without compromising the integrity of either nature.
   - "These two natures are so closely united in one Person that they were not separated even by His death." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

4. **Impassibility and Immutability of the Divine Nature**
   - The divine nature cannot suffer, change, or be limited.
   - Suffering and death are ascribed to Christ according to His human nature.
   - The confessions uphold the **impassibility** of God as essential to true divinity.
   - Any theory implying change or limitation in the divine is rejected as unorthodox.
   - "The divine nature always remained unchangeable." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Christological Formulations**
   - The confessions ground their Christology in key biblical texts (e.g., John 1, Philippians 2, Hebrews 2).
   - Philippians 2 is interpreted as Christ’s **humiliation** in status, not a literal emptying of divinity.
   - The **Incarnation** is understood as addition (assumption of humanity), not subtraction (loss of deity).
   - The confessions insist on fidelity to the **Chalcedonian Definition** as a biblical summary.
   - "He humbled Himself, being made in the likeness of men." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 16)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have provided a robust confessional bulwark against **kenosis theories** in Reformed churches, shaping the Christological boundaries of continental Reformed orthodoxy. Their clear articulation of the **immutability** and **impassibility** of the divine nature in Christ has influenced subsequent Reformed theology and served as a standard for evaluating modern Christological proposals. These confessions continue to guide churches in maintaining a biblically faithful and historically rooted understanding of the person of Christ.
