# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin firmly rejected **kenosis theories**, insisting on the **immutability** and **impassibility** of the divine nature in the **incarnation** of Christ. He maintained that the **Son of God** assumed a human nature without surrendering or diminishing any aspect of his **divine attributes**, upholding the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **communicatio idiomatum** as essential safeguards against heretical Christologies.

- "The divine nature could neither be diminished nor laid aside, nor could the Logos cease to be God in order to become man." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 13.13.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 2, Topics XIII–XIV)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on the Incarnation (various disputations)
- Richard Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (secondary, for context on Turretin’s Christology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - God’s **essence** and attributes cannot undergo change or limitation.
    - The incarnation does not involve subtraction from or alteration of the divine.
    - Kenotic theories are seen as compromising the **immutability** of God.
    - The Son remains fully God while assuming human nature.
    - "The divine nature is incapable of any real change or mutation." (Institutes, 3.11.8)

2. **Two Natures, One Person**
    - Christ is one person in two distinct, unconfused natures: divine and human.
    - The union is **hypostatic**, not essential or accidental.
    - The divine nature does not become human, nor does the human become divine.
    - Kenosis is rejected as it implies a mixing or confusion of natures.
    - "The natures are united without confusion, change, division, or separation." (Institutes, 13.8.2)

3. **Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - The properties of each nature are attributed to the person, not transferred between natures.
    - Divine attributes remain proper to the divine nature, human to the human.
    - Kenotic theories blur the proper communication of properties.
    - The unity of the person preserves the integrity of each nature.
    - "The communication of properties is not a communication of the natures themselves." (Institutes, 13.13.5)

4. **Rejection of Kenotic Christology**
    - Kenosis is interpreted as a metaphor for Christ’s humility, not a literal emptying of divinity.
    - Literal kenosis undermines the **doctrine of the Trinity** and the **deity of Christ**.
    - Turretin critiques kenotic views as a revival of ancient heresies (e.g., **Eutychianism**).
    - The Son’s self-humiliation is in the assumption of human nature, not in the loss of divine attributes.
    - "He did not empty himself of the form of God, but of the glory and majesty of its manifestation." (Institutes, 13.13.6)

5. **Scriptural Exegesis of Philippians 2**
    - The "emptying" (ekenōsen) in Philippians 2 refers to Christ’s taking the form of a servant.
    - Turretin interprets the passage as a reference to **humiliation**, not ontological change.
    - The text affirms Christ’s continued possession of divine status.
    - Kenotic readings are seen as exegetically and theologically unwarranted.
    - "The emptying is not of the divine nature, but of the condition and dignity in which he appeared." (Institutes, 13.13.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous defense of the **immutability of God** and the classical doctrine of the **incarnation** shaped subsequent Reformed responses to kenosis theories. His careful distinctions regarding the **two natures of Christ** and the **communication of properties** remain foundational in Reformed scholastic theology. Turretin’s critique of kenotic Christology continues to inform orthodox Christological formulations and serves as a bulwark against modern attempts to revise the doctrine of the person of Christ.
