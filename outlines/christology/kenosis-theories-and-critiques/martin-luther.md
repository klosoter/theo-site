# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther addressed the doctrine of **kenosis** by emphasizing the real union of **divine** and **human natures** in the person of Christ, rejecting any notion that the Son divested himself of deity in the **incarnation**. For Luther, the humility of Christ is found in his assumption of true humanity and his self-abasement, not in any surrender or limitation of his **divine attributes**.

- "He did not empty himself of the form of God, but he hid it under the form of a servant." (Lectures on Philippians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Philippians (especially on Philippians 2:5–11)
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church
- The Freedom of a Christian
- Luther’s Small Catechism
- Martin Luther’s Basic Theological Writings (ed. Timothy Lull)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Natures United in One Person**
    - Christ possesses both **divine** and **human natures** without confusion or separation.
    - The union is personal (hypostatic), not merely moral or functional.
    - The divine nature is not diminished or altered in the incarnation.
    - The human nature is truly assumed, with all its limitations except sin.
    "The Word was made flesh, not by the conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by the assumption of the manhood into God." (Small Catechism)

2. **Rejection of Kenotic Limitation of Divinity**
    - Luther opposes the idea that Christ set aside or limited his **divine attributes**.
    - Christ’s divinity remains fully present and active during the incarnation.
    - The "emptying" (kenosis) refers to Christ’s humility and self-abasement, not a metaphysical change.
    - The divine majesty is veiled, not surrendered.
    "He did not lose the form of God, but took the form of a servant." (Lectures on Philippians)

3. **Communication of Attributes (Communicatio Idiomatum)**
    - The properties of both natures are truly communicated to the one person of Christ.
    - The human nature participates in divine prerogatives through the personal union.
    - This undergirds Luther’s view of the real presence in the Lord’s Supper.
    - The unity of the person ensures the integrity of both natures.
    "Whatever can be said about God can be said about the man Christ, and vice versa." (Babylonian Captivity)

4. **Christ’s Humiliation as Hiddenness, Not Loss**
    - The humiliation of Christ is a matter of **hiddenness** (sub cruce), not ontological loss.
    - Christ’s divine glory is concealed under the form of a servant.
    - The cross reveals God’s power in apparent weakness.
    - The kenosis is an act of self-giving love, not a subtraction of deity.
    "God can be found only in suffering and the cross." (Heidelberg Disputation)

5. **Critique of Speculative Christology**
    - Luther warns against philosophical speculation about the inner workings of the incarnation.
    - He insists on the sufficiency of **Scripture** for understanding Christ’s person.
    - The mystery of the union is to be adored, not dissected.
    - Faith apprehends the paradox of Christ’s majesty in humility.
    "Where reason cannot go, faith must close its eyes and take hold of Christ." (Lectures on Philippians)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of the **personal union** and his rejection of kenotic theories have shaped Lutheran and broader Protestant Christology. His emphasis on the hiddenness of divine majesty in the humility of Christ influenced later theology of the cross and critiques of speculative metaphysics. Luther’s approach remains a touchstone for discussions of **kenosis**, incarnation, and the mystery of Christ’s person in Reformation and post-Reformation thought.
