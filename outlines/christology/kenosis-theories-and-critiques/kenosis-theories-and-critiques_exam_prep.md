### ESSAY
Kenosis is a term of dispute precisely because it sits at the nexus of exegesis, metaphysics, and soteriology. At issue is whether and how the Son’s self-emptying in Philippians 2 constitutes more than an ethical paradigm but less than a change in the being of God. If kenosis is construed as a metaphysical divestment of the Logos’ divine perfections, then the integrity of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** is imperiled, and with them the credibility of salvation as a divine work ad extra. If kenosis is reduced to an edifying trope, the reality of Christ’s humiliation, growth, learning, and suffering is domesticated. A coherent account must secure both poles: the true humility of the incarnate Son and the unaltered deity of the Logos. The history of kenotic theories reveals why this balance is difficult and where the constructive possibilities lie.

Gottfried Thomasius (1802–1875), a leading voice of the Erlangen school, is the first decisive figure because he gave kenotic Christology its programmatic shape. In the wake of speculative idealism and a growing historical consciousness, Thomasius wanted to preserve the real human development of Jesus and to make sense of New Testament depictions of ignorance, temptation, and prayer without collapsing them into docetic appearances. His multi-volume Person and Work of Christ proposed that the Son, in becoming human, truly self-limited by relinquishing the independent exercise of certain divine attributes. Thomasius refined this into a distinction between essential attributes, like holiness and love, which must be retained to ensure the identity of the Logos, and relative attributes, like omniscience and omnipresence, which could be surrendered or at least suspended in order for the incarnate life to be authentically human. The metaphysical engine here is a voluntarist self-determination in which God can, without self-contradiction, choose not to exercise aspects of his being, or even lay aside certain relative perfections, for the sake of a redemptive purpose. Thomasius reframed the conceptual center of the topic by forcing a choice: either we treat the Gospel reports of limitation as phenomenological accommodations of a divine subject who never ceases to be omnisciently conscious, or we allow that the Logos truly divests himself at the level of consciousness and presence. Thomasius chose the latter to safeguard the reality of Jesus’ human life.

Thomasius thereby set the terms for internal debates among kenoticists. Some would argue for ontological kenosis, a real renunciation of relative attributes. Others would choose functional or operational kenosis, in which the Logos retains all perfections but voluntarily declines to use them except as mediated through the human nature. Thomasius tended toward the stronger claim. The cost of his move was contested immediately by theologians who measured his proposal against the grammar of Chalcedon’s without confusion, change, division, or separation. If omniscience and omnipotence are truly divine perfections, it is difficult to deem them relative in a way that licenses their suspension without introducing **composition** into the divine life, thereby violating **divine simplicity**. Moreover, if the Logos ceased to be omniscient, how could the one subject remain identically the eternal Son who knows the Father and the Spirit perfectly and necessarily? Thomasius responded by anchoring the center of divine identity in love and holiness, but this re-specification of the essence has been seen as ad hoc and destabilizing. The lasting significance of Thomasius, however, is undeniable: his model sharpened the alternative between a metaphysically robust humility and a docetic fear, and his thesis forced classical theists to clarify how the incarnation can be a real humiliation without an ontological diminishment in God.

Charles Gore (1853–1932) represents a second decisive figure, translating kenosis into the idiom of Anglican liberal catholicism. In Lux Mundi and subsequent essays, Gore argued that the Son’s self-emptying provides a theological warrant for Christ’s participation in the limitations of first-century knowledge and culture. He tied kenosis to a broader commitment to historical criticism of Scripture and a pastoral desire to secure the humanity of Jesus as moral exemplar and sympathetic high priest. Gore insisted that divine love is intrinsically self-limiting, that full deity is enacted as the willingness to enter the conditions of finitude. His method was less metaphysically ambitious than Thomasius but no less bold in its implications: kenosis becomes a rule of divine action woven into the fabric of revelation, authorization for ascribing real ignorance and fallibility to Jesus’ human consciousness without embarrassment. Gore thus popularized kenosis in the English-speaking world and pressed its ethical dimension into the center of Christian discipleship.

The critique of Gore from classical quarters focuses on a hidden premise. If divine love is intrinsically self-limiting, does this not mean that God’s being includes a capacity for change, forfeiture, and growth inconsistent with **immutability** and **aseity**? Gore tended to treat immutability as moral steadfastness rather than metaphysical perfection, a move that many find inadequate. Moreover, by corralling the Son’s exercise of knowledge and power to the strict horizon of first-century humanity, Gore risks a naturalistic reduction of the miracles and a dilution of **theandric** action. The deeper pressure is soteriological: if the Son, in order to be truly human, must cease to be omnipotent and omniscient even relative to his person, how does he secure a work of infinite worth and unfailing efficacy? Gore’s enduring contribution, nevertheless, is to force defenders of classical Christology to specify how real historical limitation, learning, and empathy are retained in a model that denies ontological kenosis. He made the kenotic intuition spiritually and pastorally magnetic.

H. R. Mackintosh (1870–1936) advanced a Scottish refinement of kenotic themes that sought to hold together evangelical piety and critical modernity. In The Person of Jesus Christ, Mackintosh proposed that the Son’s kenosis concerns a retraction of the environment of divine glory rather than a change in essence. He made use of graded consciousness, suggesting that the Logos as man lived a truly human cognitive and affective life, with divine knowledge not abrogated but non-invasive, remaining in abeyance with respect to the human mind and will except as fitting to the vocation of the Mediator. Mackintosh thereby moves toward a functional kenosis, with a moral-trinitarian color: self-emptying is the form of divine love, but the sacrifice is in the mode of appearing and acting, not in the downgrading of deity. He is wary of Thomasius’s ontological trade-offs while remaining suspicious of accounts that attribute to Jesus a constant, unmediated divine consciousness, which he regarded as undercutting Gospel depictions of dependence, prayer, and surprise. Mackintosh framed a mediating position that would later inform analytic two-minds models without the metaphysical ballast of a high classical doctrine of God. The impact of Mackintosh is notable in contemporary appeals to kenosis as a pattern of self-giving that does not require the Son to cease to be what he is eternally.

Against the background of these kenotic constructions, Herman Bavinck (1854–1921) stands as a decisive critic whose work remains deeply relevant to Westminster examiners. Bavinck’s Reformed Dogmatics articulates a robust account of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**, and he integrates these perfections with a Chalcedonian Christology characterized by **anhypostasia–enhypostasia** and the **extra Calvinisticum**. For Bavinck, the subject of the incarnation is the eternal Son who assumes a complete human nature, including a rational soul, into union with his person. The Logos is the unitive subject of all Christ’s acts, operating according to two distinct natures. The humiliation of the incarnation is real but is a matter of status and condition rather than essence. Philippians 2 is decisive: the Son emptied himself by taking the form of a servant. The mode of exinanition is addition, not subtraction. The Son does not divest himself of divine attributes; he veils his glory and assumes the liabilities of true humanity. The **extra Calvinisticum** secures that the Son remains beyond, not bounded by, the flesh; even in the manger he fills heaven and earth. This extra is not division but the entailment of the Creator-creature distinction brought into hypostatic union. On this basis, Bavinck deflects the kenotic claim that divine omniscience and omnipotence must be relinquished for the humanity to be real. Instead, he affirms that the Logos truly knows all things as God, and in the assumed human mind he truly grows in knowledge and can be ignorant. The asymmetry is not a psychological trick but a metaphysical distinction of natures in the one person. The Logos acts theandricly, sometimes through his human nature, sometimes through his divine, often through both, without confusion.

Bavinck thus furnishes the classical reply to kenotic pressures. To the claim that such a model makes Jesus’ temptations unreal, he answers that temptations are suffered in the human nature and are therefore fully real, because the human nature is enhypostatized in the person of the Son. To the charge that this yields a split consciousness, he replies that the personal subject is one, but the capacities according to which he thinks and wills are two, with a real integrity of the human psychological life. To the worry that this renders miracles arbitrary, he notes that the economy of Christ’s life is governed by the mission and obedience of the Son; he does not will to mediate divine omniscience into the human mind at every moment because his **estate of humiliation** is ordered to obedient suffering. For Bavinck, the principal error of kenotic theories lies in translating the economic humility of the incarnate life into an ontological contraction of deity, which both violates **simplicity** and jeopardizes salvation.

Bruce McCormack (born 1952) is the most decisive contemporary figure because he offers a post-Barthian attempt to retrieve kenosis within a Reformed idiom that explicitly revises classical metaphysics. McCormack reads Barth as re-centering the doctrine of God in the decision of election, such that God’s being is in act, determined by the eternal self-determination to be God for us in Jesus Christ. On this reconstructive proposal, kenosis is not an external economic posture supervening upon a pre-determined divine essence; rather, self-emptying belongs to the very identity of the Son as electing God. The incarnation, then, can involve a genuine divine self-limitation with respect to omniscience and omnipotence, not as a contingent condescension but as the definitive disclosure of who God is eternally. McCormack argues that this model best secures the New Testament’s narrative of divine humility and prevents a functional Nestorianism sometimes discerned in classical models that overly compartmentalize the divine and human operations. Further, by recasting **immutability** as covenantal faithfulness in a history of self-giving, McCormack aims to meet the kenotic intuition head-on while avoiding the metaphysical impossibility of an impassible God who suffers.

McCormack’s proposal reframes the debates at all three levels. Internally, he aligns with a robust kenoticism that touches the being of God, but he does so by altering the constraints rather than by evading them. Externally, he challenges the classical doctrine of God, suggesting that **simplicity** and **impassibility** are not biblically mandated in their metaphysical sense and have been misapplied to Christology. In contemporary terms, he offers a bridge to relational theists, open theists, and process sympathizers who prize divine vulnerability. The strengths of McCormack’s argument include its insistence that the subject of incarnation is truly the eternal Son and that humility is not a divine afterthought. The weaknesses, however, are severe when measured by Chalcedonian and Reformed canons. If election constitutes God’s essence and if self-limitation with respect to knowledge and power belongs to that essence, then God’s actuality becomes historically conditioned, and the eternal act of God includes real potentiality that is actualized in time. This contradicts **aseity**, in which God is from himself and not dependent upon a decree outside his simple act. It also introduces a mutable identity into the Godhead, since the Son’s being would be otherwise if not for the historical economy. Moreover, Christologically, if the Logos’ omniscience and omnipotence are curtailed even at the level of his person, then the one acting in the human nature is not omniscient as God, and the asymmetry central to Reformed Christology is lost. The **extra Calvinisticum** becomes unintelligible, since the Son would not simply be present beyond the flesh in the fullness of deity. Finally, the soteriological concern returns with force: it is precisely because the incarnate subject is unchangeably omnipotent and omniscient as God that his obedience and atonement possess infinite worth and unshakeable efficacy. McCormack’s revision risks making the triumph of Christ contingent upon a curtailed divine life that bears too close a resemblance to a creaturely being in process.

Having set the decisive figures in place, we can articulate a constructive position that sustains genuine self-emptying without ontological loss. The key lies in distinguishing hypostatic subject and natural capacities while maintaining the unity of person. The hypostatic union, grounded in **anhypostasia–enhypostasia**, teaches that the human nature assumed by the Logos has no independent personal subsistence but is enhypostatized in the person of the Son. The person is the acting subject of both natures. The two natures retain their properties, as Chalcedon rules, such that the Logos remains fully omniscient and omnipotent as God, and the human nature remains finite, passible, and locally extended. The operations of the person are according to nature. This yields a lex of kenosis. The Son emptied himself by taking the form of a servant. The exinanition is the assumption of a nature through which the Son can experience limitation, ignorance, temptation, suffering, and death. The humility is narrative and economic, not essential and ontological. It is real because the human nature is real and because the Son truly lives and dies in it. It is not a charade because the human operations are not overridden by the divine. It does not change God because nothing new arises within the simple life of God; the novelty is on the side of the created nature and the created relation that God freely wills.

This account answers common examiner challenges. Does it split Christ into two subjects? No, because the person is one, and the personal identity that owns the human experiences is the eternal Son. The human nature is not a mask or organ independent of the person. The possibility of real human ignorance is grounded in the integrity of the human intellect, which does not contain within itself omniscience. The Logos knows all things as God; he does not communicate the content of omniscience to the finite human mind except as fits the mediatorial vocation. Does this make Jesus’ prayers and dependence artificial? No, because the human will and affections are real, and the Son as man obeys, prays, and trusts the Father according to that nature. The dependence is not feigned; it is the very purpose for which he assumed the human life. Does the model dishonor Philippians 2 by rendering kenosis merely apparent? No, because the emptying is concrete in the form of servanthood, the obedience unto death, and the relinquishment of the visible glory due to him. The humiliation is hypostatically mediated through the humanity, not ontologically located in deity.

This model also keeps adjacent loci coherent. In the doctrine of God, it preserves **divine simplicity** and **immutability** by refusing to allow the incarnation to introduce composition or change into God’s essence. In Trinity, it safeguards the eternal relations of origin and the consubstantiality of the Son, since he remains who he is while assuming a human nature. In soteriology, it upholds the axiom that what is not assumed is not healed, because the human mind, will, and affections are assumed, not replaced by divinity. It also secures the infinite worth of the atonement, since the one who offers obedience and suffers is identical with the Lord of glory as to person. In Scripture, it supports a robust exegesis of Philippians 2: the emptying is by taking form, and the harpagmon concerns the refusal to seize equality with God as a pretext for avoiding servanthood, rather than a renunciation of deity. In ecclesiology and sacramental debates, the model interfaces with the **extra Calvinisticum**, resisting any construal of Christ’s bodily presence that collapses the Creator-creature distinction or the circumscription of the human nature.

What of contemporary pressures that seem to push toward kenosis? Open theism and process theology prize a God who takes risks and learns. Kenosis is often invoked as the proof text for divine vulnerability. The classical reply must concede vulnerability in the assumed human nature while denying that God learns or risks in his essence. The risk and learning belong to the incarnate economy, and their reality is undiminished by the fact that the hypostatic subject is never ignorant as God. The ethical-political uses of kenosis, often mobilized to critique domineering power, need not be rejected, but they must be doctrinally bordered. The Church is called to the mind of Christ, which is humble, obedient, and self-giving. That ethical kenosis is grounded in the mystery that the Lord became a servant. But the Lord did not cease to be Lord, and Christian humility is not the repudiation of creaturely goods or the abolition of authority; it is their proper use in service.

Analytic Christology has offered tools that can sharpen the presentation without altering its substance. Two-minds models seek to describe how one person can sustain both a divine and a human range of cognitive states. A classical theist can deploy a chastened version of this, provided it is governed by Chalcedon and by **communicatio idiomatum** rightly understood. The communicatio is not a transfer of properties between natures but a predication of properties to the one person who subsists in two natures. Thus it is correct to say God suffered, by the communication of idioms, without implying that the divine nature suffered. The theopaschite formula is affirmed in this precise sense. This renders Jesus’ cry of dereliction fully human and truly the cry of God the Son according to the assumed nature.

Some objections deserve an explicit answer. If Christ is omniscient as God, how can he genuinely be ignorant as man without contradiction? The answer lies in the logic of **asymmetric union**. Contradiction would occur only if the same subject were both ignorant and omniscient in the same respect. The respect here is different. According to the human intellect, the Son can be ignorant; according to the divine, he cannot. The predication is to the same person according to diverse natures. Another objection claims that such a model is indistinguishable from docetism because the divine mind is always present. But docetism denies real human nature or experience. The present account insists on the full reality of the human psychological life and on the integrity of human experiences of ignorance, pain, and growth. A third objection contends that our position makes the miracles arbitrary acts of a divine nature breaking into a human life. The reply is that the miracles are acts of the one person operating theandricly, fitting to the vocation of the Messiah, and ordered by the economy of obedience. They are not violations but fulfillments of the union’s purpose.

Finally, where does this leave the decisive figures? Thomasius compels us to reckon with the human reality of Christ, but his ontological kenosis should be rejected because it imposes composition and alteration on God. Gore rightly presses the ethical and pastoral power of kenosis but tends to relax metaphysical constraints in a way that undercuts divine transcendence and soteriological assurance. Mackintosh points toward a functional kenosis that can be sustained within a higher dogmatics, though his proposals require anchoring in a strong doctrine of God. Bavinck gives that anchor, showing how **extra Calvinisticum**, **anhypostasia–enhypostasia**, and the two states of Christ provide the grammar for humble deity without ontological loss. McCormack’s revisionist project is the most formidable contemporary alternative, but it ought to be resisted because it lets the economy rewrite the immanent identity of God, thereby dissolving **simplicity** and compromising **aseity**.

The position defended is therefore clear. Kenosis is real and central, but it is economic and hypostatic, not essential and ontological. The Son emptied himself by taking. He humbled himself by obeying. He suffered and died in the human nature that he assumed. All this is grounded in the unchanging plenitude of the divine life. This is the only account that safeguards the biblical narrative of humility and the dogmatic stability upon which the Church’s worship and salvation rest. The exam room implication is straightforward: when pressed about Jesus’ ignorance, temptation, or suffering, answer with the integrity of the human nature and the unity of the person. When questioned about **immutability** or **simplicity**, confess the unaltered deity of the Son. When challenged with modern kenotic alternatives, grant their intention but expose their metaphysical cost. And when asked why any of this matters, say that only a Christ who remains truly God can truly save, and only a Christ who becomes truly man can truly suffer and obey on our behalf. Kenosis without collapse is not a compromise but the heart of orthodox Christology.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Kenosis is the Son’s self-emptying in the incarnation as economic humiliation and servanthood, an exinanition by taking the form of a servant, not an ontological divestment of divine perfections, preserving **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and Chalcedon.
- Decisive figures:
  - Gottfried Thomasius: initiated ontological kenosis via self-limitation of relative attributes.
  - Charles Gore: Anglican kenosis for historical limitation and ethical paradigm of divine love.
  - H. R. Mackintosh: functional kenosis with graded consciousness, divine self-retraction of glory.
  - Herman Bavinck: Reformed critique grounding humiliation in assumption, **anhypostasia–enhypostasia**, **extra Calvinisticum**.
  - Bruce McCormack: post-Barthian kenotic revision of God’s being through election and divine self-emptying.
- Debates:
  - Internal: ontological vs functional kenosis; extent of self-limitation; consciousness and operations according to nature.
  - External: classical **simplicity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**; Chalcedon; **communicatio idiomatum** and **extra Calvinisticum**.
  - Contemporary: analytic two-minds models; open theism and process pressures; ethical-political kenosis.
- Defended position: Affirm economic and hypostatic kenosis without ontological loss; the Logos remains fully and unchangeably God, assumes real human limitation, and acts theandricly according to both natures.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does your view make Jesus’ ignorance unreal? No, ignorance is real according to the human intellect, while the person remains omniscient as God.
  - How does Philippians 2 teach emptying by taking? The text states he emptied himself by taking servant-form, indicating addition not subtraction.
  - What secures salvation if not ontological kenosis? The unchangeably divine person secures infinite worth and efficacy of atonement.
  - Why not accept McCormack’s kenotic Reformed model? It compromises **simplicity** and **aseity** by letting the economy constitute God’s being.
  - How do you avoid Nestorian split minds? One person acts through two natures; operations are according to nature under **anhypostasia–enhypostasia** and the **communicatio idiomatum**.
