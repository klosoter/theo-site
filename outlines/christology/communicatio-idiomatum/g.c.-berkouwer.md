# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **communicatio idiomatum** with a careful emphasis on the mystery and integrity of the **two natures of Christ** within the framework of **Reformed Christology**. He critiqued both Lutheran and Reformed excesses, seeking to uphold the unity of the **person of Christ** while maintaining the distinction between **divine and human attributes**. Berkouwer’s analysis is marked by a concern for the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the implications of the communicatio idiomatum for **soteriology**.

- "The communicatio idiomatum is not a speculative construction, but a confession of the mystery of the incarnation." (The Person of Christ)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Definition**
    - Emphasizes the unity of Christ’s person without confusion or separation of natures.
    - Insists that the communicatio idiomatum must not compromise the distinction between **divine and human natures**.
    - Views the Chalcedonian formula as a safeguard against both Nestorianism and Eutychianism.
    - Sees the doctrine as essential for a proper understanding of the incarnation.
    - "The church’s confession of the communicatio idiomatum is inseparable from its confession of the two natures in one person." (The Person of Christ)

2. **Rejection of Eutychian and Nestorian Tendencies**
    - Warns against any interpretation that blends or separates the natures of Christ.
    - Critiques both Lutheran and Reformed missteps in applying the communicatio idiomatum.
    - Argues that the mystery of the incarnation resists rationalistic explanation.
    - Maintains that true **Christological confession** preserves both distinction and unity.
    - "We must not allow the communicatio idiomatum to become a rationalistic bridge between the natures." (The Person of Christ)

3. **Functional Christology and Soteriology**
    - Connects the communicatio idiomatum directly to the work of Christ in redemption.
    - Stresses that the unity of Christ’s person grounds the efficacy of his mediatorial work.
    - Argues that the doctrine is not an abstract metaphysical claim but is vital for understanding salvation.
    - Emphasizes the importance of Christ’s true humanity and true deity for atonement.
    - "The communicatio idiomatum is not a speculative luxury, but a soteriological necessity." (The Work of Christ)

4. **Critical Engagement with Lutheran and Reformed Traditions**
    - Analyzes the Lutheran doctrine of the genus maiestaticum and its implications for Christ’s presence.
    - Highlights the Reformed concern for the integrity of Christ’s humanity.
    - Seeks a mediating position that avoids both overemphasis on the communication of attributes and their separation.
    - Advocates for a biblically grounded, confessional approach to the doctrine.
    - "Both traditions must be self-critical in their handling of the communicatio idiomatum." (The Person of Christ)

5. **Mystery and Confession over Speculation**
    - Insists that the communicatio idiomatum is ultimately a matter of doxological confession.
    - Warns against reducing the doctrine to philosophical categories.
    - Emphasizes the importance of humility before the mystery of the incarnation.
    - Encourages the church to confess rather than explain the union of natures.
    - "The communicatio idiomatum is confessed, not explained." (The Person of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced treatment of the **communicatio idiomatum** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by encouraging a return to the confessional and biblical roots of **Christological doctrine**. His insistence on the mystery and unity of Christ’s person has provided a corrective to both speculative theology and reductionistic tendencies. Berkouwer’s work continues to shape discussions on the person and work of Christ, especially in ecumenical and dogmatic contexts.
