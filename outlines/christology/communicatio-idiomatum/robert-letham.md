# Robert Letham (1947–)

Robert Letham approaches the **communicatio idiomatum** as a vital aspect of **Christology**, emphasizing its role in articulating the union of **divine and human natures** in the person of Christ. He maintains that the properties of each nature are truly predicated of the one **person of Christ** without confusion or separation, in line with the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **Reformed tradition**.

- "The communicatio idiomatum is not a transfer of properties from one nature to the other, but the communication of the properties of both natures to the one person." ("The Work of Christ")

## Key Works

- The Person of Christ (Contours of Christian Theology)
- Systematic Theology
- The Work of Christ
- "The Humanity of Christ in the Theology of the Reformation" (chapter in edited volumes)
- "Union with Christ: In Scripture, History, and Theology"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Chalcedonian Christology as Framework**
    - Affirms the **hypostatic union**: Christ is one person in two natures, divine and human.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is grounded in the unity of Christ’s person, not a mingling of natures.
    - The properties of each nature are truly ascribed to the person, not transferred between natures.
    - Rejects both **Nestorian** separation and **Eutychian** confusion.
    - "Chalcedon’s definition is the essential safeguard for the communicatio idiomatum." (The Person of Christ)

2. **Reformed Distinctives on Communication**
    - Upholds the Reformed distinction between the natures, especially regarding the **finitude of Christ’s humanity**.
    - Opposes Lutheran views of ubiquity, insisting the human nature does not acquire divine attributes.
    - Emphasizes that communication is of idioms (properties), not of the natures themselves.
    - The person, not the nature, is the subject of predication.
    - "The Reformed tradition insists that the communication is not of the natures but of their properties to the person." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Scriptural Basis for Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - Grounds the doctrine in biblical passages (e.g., Acts 20:28, "God purchased with his own blood").
    - Sees scriptural warrant for predicating divine and human attributes of the one Christ.
    - Argues that biblical Christology requires this communicative principle for coherence.
    - Uses scriptural data to refute both Nestorian and Eutychian errors.
    - "Scripture itself predicates what is true of each nature to the one person, Jesus Christ." (The Person of Christ)

4. **Safeguarding the Integrity of Both Natures**
    - Maintains the full reality and integrity of both the **divine** and **human** natures.
    - Rejects any blurring or mixing of attributes between natures.
    - The communicatio idiomatum does not entail a change in either nature.
    - Christ’s humanity remains finite, even as his person is the eternal Son.
    - "The communicatio idiomatum does not mean that the divine becomes human or the human becomes divine." (The Work of Christ)

5. **Soteriological Significance**
    - Asserts that the communicatio idiomatum is essential for understanding the efficacy of Christ’s work.
    - The unity of the person ensures that Christ’s acts have saving significance for humanity.
    - The doctrine undergirds the reality of the **atonement** and **mediation**.
    - Without this communication, the benefits of Christ’s work could not be truly applied to believers.
    - "Only if the one person is both God and man can his saving work be effective for us." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Letham’s articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** has reinforced a robust, classical **Reformed Christology** for contemporary readers. His work has clarified the doctrine’s biblical foundations and its importance for both dogmatic theology and pastoral application. By engaging both historical and modern debates, Letham has helped ensure that the doctrine remains central in evangelical and Reformed discussions of the person and work of Christ.
