# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirms the **communicatio idiomatum** as a necessary implication of the **hypostatic union**, insisting that the **divine** and **human natures** of Christ are united in one **person** without confusion or separation. He maintains that the properties of each nature are truly predicated of the one Christ, while carefully distinguishing the natures and robustly affirming their union in the **mediatorial work** of Christ.

- "We do not imagine a mingling of the natures, but hold that each retains its distinctive character, while both are united in one person." (Institutes II.xiv.4)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially II.xiii–xiv)
- Commentary on the Gospel According to John
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Sermons on the Deity of Christ
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Hypostatic Union Without Confusion**
    - Christ’s **divine** and **human natures** are united in one person, not mingled or fused.
    - Each nature retains its own properties and operations.
    - The union is personal, not essential or natural.
    - Calvin rejects both Eutychian and Nestorian errors.
    "For we affirm that Christ is God and man, in such a way that each nature retains its properties entire, and yet the two natures constitute only one Christ." (Institutes II.xiv.4)

2. **True Communication of Properties**
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** allows predication of properties of both natures to the one person of Christ.
    - What is true of either nature can be truly said of Christ as a person.
    - Calvin distinguishes between the subject (the person) and the natures (the properties).
    - This communication is not a transfer of attributes between natures but a personal predication.
    "Whatever is peculiar to the one nature is transferred to the other by the figure of speech called communicatio idiomatum." (Institutes II.xiv.2)

3. **Rejection of Local Extension of the Divine Nature**
    - Calvin denies that the divine nature is locally contained in Christ’s human body.
    - He opposes Lutheran ubiquitarianism, which posits the omnipresence of Christ’s human nature.
    - The divine nature remains infinite and uncircumscribed, even in the incarnation.
    - The union does not entail a mixing or spatial extension of the divine.
    "The body of Christ, therefore, is not everywhere, nor is the divinity so circumscribed as to be confined within it." (Institutes IV.xvii.30)

4. **Christ’s Mediation Rooted in Personal Union**
    - The efficacy of Christ’s **mediatorial work** depends on the unity of his person.
    - Both natures are necessary for Christ to be the true Mediator between God and man.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** undergirds the reality of Christ’s saving work.
    - Calvin emphasizes the inseparability of Christ’s person in all his redemptive acts.
    "For the property of each nature is so preserved that the unity of the person is not destroyed." (Institutes II.xiv.4)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Christological Predication**
    - Calvin grounds the **communicatio idiomatum** in biblical texts (e.g., Acts 20:28, John 1:14).
    - Scripture attributes divine and human things to the one Christ.
    - Theological language must follow the pattern of biblical predication.
    - Calvin’s exegesis supports the orthodox Christological formulae.
    "Scripture sometimes attributes to him what must be referred peculiarly to one of his natures, and sometimes what belongs peculiarly to the other." (Institutes II.xiv.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s careful articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** shaped the Reformed tradition’s Christology, distinguishing it from both Lutheran and Roman Catholic approaches. His insistence on the integrity of both natures and the unity of the person provided a framework for later Reformed confessions and scholastic developments. Calvin’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of the **hypostatic union** and the person of Christ, ensuring that his nuanced approach remains a touchstone for orthodox Christological reflection.
