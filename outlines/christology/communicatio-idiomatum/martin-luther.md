# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of the **communicatio idiomatum** is central to his Christology, emphasizing the real union of the **divine and human natures** in the person of Christ. He insists that the attributes of both natures are truly communicated to the one person, especially as this undergirds his understanding of the **Lord’s Supper** and the believer’s union with Christ. Luther’s approach challenges both **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors, seeking to preserve the integrity of each nature while affirming their full participation in the one Christ.

- "For God and man are one person, and therefore the attributes of the one nature are ascribed to the other." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- The Small Catechism (1529)
- The Large Catechism (1529)
- Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper (1528)
- Martin Luther’s Basic Theological Writings (ed. Timothy F. Lull)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Personal Union of Natures**
   - Christ is one person in whom **divine and human natures** are inseparably united.
   - The union is not a mixture or confusion but a true, personal union.
   - Each nature retains its distinct properties while being fully possessed by the one person.
   - This union grounds the possibility of the **communicatio idiomatum**.
   - "The Word was made flesh, that is, God became man, not that the natures were mingled, but that the one person is both God and man." (Large Catechism)

2. **Communication of Attributes**
   - The properties of each nature are truly ascribed to the one person of Christ.
   - Divine attributes (e.g., omnipotence) can be predicated of the man Jesus.
   - Human attributes (e.g., suffering, death) can be predicated of the Son of God.
   - This communication is essential for the efficacy of Christ’s work.
   - "Whatever is said of Christ, is said of the whole person, and not of the natures separately." (Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper)

3. **Rejection of Nestorianism and Eutychianism**
   - Luther opposes any division of Christ’s person (Nestorianism).
   - He also rejects any confusion or blending of the natures (Eutychianism).
   - The communicatio idiomatum preserves both the unity and distinction of natures.
   - This balance is vital for a proper understanding of redemption.
   - "We must not divide the person, nor confound the natures." (Lectures on Galatians)

4. **Implications for the Lord’s Supper**
   - The real presence of Christ’s body and blood is possible because of the communicatio idiomatum.
   - Christ’s human nature shares in divine attributes through the personal union.
   - This enables Christ’s body to be present “in, with, and under” the elements.
   - The doctrine safeguards the reality of sacramental union without localizing Christ’s body.
   - "His body is present wherever his divinity is, because of the personal union." (Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper)

5. **Union with Christ and Salvation**
   - The communicatio idiomatum grounds the believer’s union with Christ.
   - Through faith, believers participate in Christ’s benefits as true God and true man.
   - The righteousness of Christ is truly communicated to the believer.
   - This union assures the efficacy of Christ’s atoning work for salvation.
   - "He who believes in Christ is united with him and partakes of all his gifts." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust doctrine of the **communicatio idiomatum** shaped Lutheran Christology and distinguished it from both Reformed and Roman Catholic positions. His emphasis on the real union of natures influenced debates on the **Lord’s Supper** and the nature of Christ’s presence. Luther’s teaching remains foundational for Lutheran theology and continues to inform ecumenical discussions on Christology and the sacraments.
