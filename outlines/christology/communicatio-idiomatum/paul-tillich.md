# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **communicatio idiomatum** not through classical Chalcedonian categories, but by reinterpreting the doctrine within his **method of correlation** and **symbolic theology**. For Tillich, the union of **divine and human natures** in Christ is best understood existentially, as the manifestation of the **New Being** that overcomes estrangement, rather than as a metaphysical exchange of properties.

- "The assertion that the divine and the human are united in the Christ is a symbol for the manifestation of the New Being." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially sections on Christology)
- The Shaking of the Foundations (sermons on the person of Christ)
- The Dynamics of Faith
- A History of Christian Thought (lectures on Christological development)
- Theology of Culture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Symbolic Interpretation of Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - The traditional doctrine is reinterpreted as a **symbol** expressing the existential unity of **divine and human**.
    - Tillich rejects a literal or metaphysical transfer of properties between natures.
    - The communicatio idiomatum points to the **New Being** that heals existential estrangement.
    - Christ is the concrete symbol of the unity between God and humanity.
    - "The doctrine of the communicatio idiomatum is a symbolic expression of the unity of the divine and human in the New Being." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

2. **Existential Christology**
    - Christ reveals the solution to the existential problem of **estrangement**.
    - The union of natures is not ontological but existential and relational.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is meaningful as it relates to human experience of salvation.
    - The focus is on the impact of Christ as the **bearer of the New Being**.
    - "The Christological question is the question of the New Being in whom the gap between essential and existential being is overcome." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

3. **Method of Correlation**
    - Doctrines like communicatio idiomatum are interpreted through the correlation of **existential questions** and **theological answers**.
    - Christology answers the question of how the divine meets the human condition.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is not a speculative doctrine but a response to existential need.
    - Theological language is always symbolic and correlational, not literal.
    - "The method of correlation interprets symbols like the communicatio idiomatum as answers to the ultimate concerns of existence." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

4. **Rejection of Substantialist Metaphysics**
    - Tillich critiques classical metaphysical approaches to the union of natures.
    - He avoids speaking of substances or essences being exchanged.
    - The focus is on the **event** of revelation, not on metaphysical categories.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is meaningful only within a non-substantialist, existential framework.
    - "The metaphysical language of substances and natures must be replaced by existential and personalist categories." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

5. **Christ as the New Being**
    - Christ is the manifestation of the **New Being** who overcomes the split between God and humanity.
    - The communicatio idiomatum expresses the participation of the divine in the human predicament.
    - The union in Christ is the ground for the possibility of **reconciliation**.
    - The doctrine is valuable as a symbol of hope and transformation, not as a metaphysical explanation.
    - "In the Christ, the New Being appears, in whom the divine and the human are united for the sake of salvation." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s reinterpretation of the **communicatio idiomatum** shifted the focus from metaphysical speculation to existential and symbolic meaning, influencing modern **liberal theology** and existentialist approaches to Christology. His work challenged traditional formulations and encouraged theologians to reconsider the relevance of classical doctrines in contemporary contexts. While controversial among orthodox theologians, Tillich’s approach remains a significant reference point for discussions on the relationship between **divinity and humanity** in Christ.
