# Martin Chemnitz (1522–1586)

Martin Chemnitz was a pivotal Lutheran theologian who articulated and defended the doctrine of **communicatio idiomatum** within the framework of **Christology**. He insisted on the true union of **divine and human natures** in the person of Christ, emphasizing the proper distinction and communication of attributes as essential for a correct understanding of the **incarnation** and the efficacy of **redemption**.

- "For the properties of each nature are truly communicated to the person, but not from one nature to the other." (The Two Natures in Christ)

## Key Works

- The Two Natures in Christ (De Duabus Naturis in Christo)
- The Lord’s Supper (De Coena Domini)
- Examination of the Council of Trent (Examen Concilii Tridentini)
- The Formula of Concord (contributor and interpreter)
- Loci Theologici

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Personal Union of Natures**
    - Christ’s **divine and human natures** are united in one person without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - The **personal union** is the basis for the communication of attributes.
    - Each nature retains its own essential properties even in union.
    - The union is not merely moral or accidental, but true and substantial.
    - "The union is not a mingling of natures, but a true joining together in one person." (The Two Natures in Christ)

2. **Genus Idiomaticum (Communication of Properties)**
    - The attributes of both natures are truly ascribed to the one person of Christ.
    - This communication is not from nature to nature, but from each nature to the person.
    - Predications such as "God suffered" are true because of the personal union.
    - The genus idiomaticum safeguards the reality of the incarnation and atonement.
    - "The properties of each nature are truly communicated to the person, but not from one nature to the other." (The Two Natures in Christ)

3. **Genus Maiestaticum (Majestic Genus)**
    - The human nature of Christ is truly exalted due to its union with the divine.
    - Divine attributes are communicated to the human nature in a manner fitting the personal union.
    - This undergirds the Lutheran doctrine of the real presence in the Lord’s Supper.
    - The communication does not destroy or alter the human nature’s essence.
    - "The divine nature imparts its gifts to the assumed human nature according to the mode of the union." (The Two Natures in Christ)

4. **Genus Apotelesmaticum (Efficacy of the Union)**
    - All Christ’s mediatorial acts are performed by the one person, utilizing both natures.
    - The work of redemption depends on the full participation of both natures.
    - The efficacy of Christ’s work is grounded in the unity of the person.
    - The genus apotelesmaticum ensures the sufficiency and applicability of Christ’s atonement.
    - "Whatever Christ does for our salvation, He does according to both natures in the unity of His person." (The Two Natures in Christ)

5. **Rejection of Eutychianism and Nestorianism**
    - Chemnitz opposes any confusion or separation of the natures.
    - He maintains the integrity of both natures against Eutychian and Nestorian errors.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is a safeguard against Christological heresies.
    - Proper distinction and union are necessary for orthodox Christology.
    - "We must neither confound the natures nor divide the person." (The Two Natures in Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Chemnitz’s rigorous articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** became foundational for Lutheran Christology and shaped the **Formula of Concord**. His careful distinctions influenced later debates with Reformed theologians and provided a robust defense against both ancient and contemporary Christological errors. Chemnitz’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the union of **divine and human natures** in Christ, ensuring clarity and orthodoxy in the doctrine of the incarnation.
