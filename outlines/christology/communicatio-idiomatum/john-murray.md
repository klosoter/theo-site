# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in twentieth-century Reformed theology, upheld a robust doctrine of the **person of Christ** and the **hypostatic union**, emphasizing the classical Reformed understanding of the **communicatio idiomatum**. He maintained that the properties of both the **divine and human natures** are truly predicated of the one **person of Christ**, without confusion or division, in accordance with the **Chalcedonian Definition**.

- "The properties of both natures are truly and properly ascribed to the one person, and the one person is the subject of all the predicates belonging to either nature." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied (1955)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "The Person of Christ" (essay in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "The Reformed Faith and Modern Substitutes" (lecture)
- Westminster Confession of Faith: A Commentary

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
   - Christ is one person with two distinct natures, divine and human.
   - The **communicatio idiomatum** is grounded in the unity of the person, not a fusion of natures.
   - All actions and experiences are predicated of the one person, not divided between natures.
   - The person, not the nature, is the subject of all Christological predicates.
   - "It is the person who acts, and the natures supply the capacities for action." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Distinction Without Separation**
   - The divine and human natures remain distinct, without confusion or change.
   - The attributes of each nature are not transferred or mixed.
   - The **communicatio idiomatum** does not imply a communication of essence.
   - The distinction safeguards both Christ’s true deity and true humanity.
   - "The properties of the one nature are never attributed to the other nature, but to the person." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Predication of Properties**
   - Properties of both natures can be truly predicated of the one person.
   - Scriptural language (e.g., "the Lord of glory was crucified") exemplifies this principle.
   - The person is the proper subject of all predicates, whether divine or human.
   - This predication is not merely verbal but reflects ontological reality.
   - "The communicatio idiomatum is the necessary corollary of the hypostatic union." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Rejection of Eutychianism and Nestorianism**
   - Murray rejects any confusion of natures (Eutychianism) or division of person (Nestorianism).
   - The **communicatio idiomatum** avoids both errors by maintaining unity and distinction.
   - The Reformed tradition affirms the Chalcedonian boundaries.
   - Christ is not a tertium quid, but truly God and truly man in one person.
   - "We must avoid both the confusion of natures and the division of the person." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Soteriological Significance**
   - The **communicatio idiomatum** is essential for understanding the efficacy of Christ’s work.
   - Only one who is both God and man can accomplish redemption.
   - The unity of the person ensures that Christ’s mediatorial work is truly representative and effective.
   - The doctrine undergirds the reality of Christ’s obedience, suffering, and exaltation.
   - "The redemptive significance of Christ’s person depends upon the reality of the communicatio idiomatum." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** has shaped contemporary Reformed Christology, reinforcing the importance of the **hypostatic union** for both doctrinal clarity and soteriological depth. His writings continue to serve as a standard exposition of the classical Reformed position, influencing pastors, theologians, and confessional documents. By upholding the unity and distinction within the person of Christ, Murray has helped preserve the integrity of orthodox Christological confession in the modern era.
