# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a careful doctrine of the **communicatio idiomatum** within the framework of **classical Christology**. He upheld the **Chalcedonian Definition**, insisting that the communication of attributes occurs at the level of the **person** (hypostasis), not the natures themselves, thereby preserving the full integrity of both the divine and human natures in the **personal union**.

- "The communication of properties is not made from one nature to the other, but from both natures to the person." ("Institutes of Elenctic Theology")

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Commentarius in Epistolam ad Hebraeos
- The Doctrine of Christ (sections within Institutes)
- Selected Questions on the Person and Offices of Christ (Institutes, Topics XIII–XIV)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Communication at the Level of the Person (Hypostasis)**
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is predicated of the person of Christ, not directly of the divine or human nature.
    - The **properties** of each nature are truly attributed to the one person, Jesus Christ.
    - This preserves the integrity and distinction of each nature after the union.
    - Turretin rejects any confusion or mixture of the natures in the communication.
    "The properties of each nature are truly communicated to the person, but not to the other nature." (Institutes)

2. **Rejection of Eutychian and Nestorian Errors**
    - Turretin opposes Eutychianism, which confuses or mixes the natures.
    - He also rejects Nestorianism, which divides the person of Christ.
    - The **personal union** is neither a fusion nor a mere conjunction.
    - The communication of idioms safeguards against both extremes.
    "We must avoid both the confusion of the natures and the division of the person." (Institutes)

3. **Threefold Communication of Idioms**
    - Turretin distinguishes between **communicatio idiomatum** in abstracto (to the natures), in concreto (to the person), and the genus of communication.
    - Only in concreto (to the person) is legitimate in Reformed theology.
    - He critiques Lutheran views that allow for communication in abstracto.
    - This distinction is crucial for maintaining orthodox Christology.
    "The communication of idioms is to be understood in concreto, not in abstracto." (Institutes)

4. **Impassibility and Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - The divine nature remains **impassible** and **immutable** even in the incarnation.
    - Suffering and death are predicated of the person according to the human nature.
    - The divine nature does not undergo change or suffering.
    - This commitment upholds the transcendence and perfection of God.
    "Christ suffered and died, not as God, but as man; yet the person who is God suffered in the flesh." (Institutes)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - Turretin grounds his doctrine in key biblical texts (e.g., Acts 20:28, "God purchased with his own blood").
    - He interprets such passages as attributing actions to the person, not to the divine nature per se.
    - Scripture’s language is accommodated to the mystery of the incarnation.
    - The doctrine is a necessary implication of the biblical witness to Christ’s person.
    "Scripture attributes to the person what belongs to either nature, according to the mode of the union." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s precise articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** became a standard reference in later **Reformed dogmatics**, shaping confessional statements and theological education. His careful distinctions influenced subsequent debates with Lutheran and Roman Catholic theologians, reinforcing the **Chalcedonian** boundaries within Protestant orthodoxy. Turretin’s legacy endures in the clarity and rigor he brought to the doctrine of Christ’s person and natures.
