### ESSAY
The communicatio idiomatum is the rule of person-centered predication in Christology: what belongs to either nature may be truly said of the one person of the Son, yet without transference or mixing of properties between the natures. The doctrine functions as the grammar for saying that the one who is God was born, suffered, and died, and that the one who is man forgives sins and is worshiped. Properly ordered to the **hypostatic union**, it secures both the full divinity and full humanity of Christ and the undivided subject of all his acts. It is not a mechanism by which divinity flows into humanity or humanity into divinity, but a logical and ontological rule following from the assumption of a complete human nature by the eternal person of the Son.

Cyril of Alexandria (d. 444) set the decisive trajectory for this rule by insisting on unity of subject. His polemic against Nestorius took aim at a grammar that made Mary mother of the man but not mother of God. Cyril’s Letters to Nestorius and to John of Antioch alongside his Twelve Anathemas press a single conviction: the Word himself is the subject of every act and passion of Jesus of Nazareth. Cyril’s favored formula, one nature of the Word incarnate, must be heard in the Alexandrian register as asserting one composite hypostasis, not abolishing the distinction of natures. He refuses any moral union or accidental conjunction, and he rejects the idea that predicates of the humanity can be fenced off from the person who is the Word. This is the seed of the **communicatio idiomatum**. We may say that God suffered, yet we must add the Cyrilline qualification that he suffered in the flesh. That is the core of **reduplication** speech. The predication pertains to the person simpliciter, with a reduplicative note specifying according to which nature the act or passion is realized. Cyril’s theology is not a relaxed indifference to natures but a rigorous insistence that the natures subsist in the singular person of the Son. Examiners will probe whether this makes the divine nature passible. The answer is Cyril’s own: the impassible Word truly suffered humanly, for the manhood is his own, yet the divine nature remains impassible in itself. The communication is of names to the person, not of properties to the natures.

Leo the Great (d. 461) codified a Chalcedonian balance that preserved Cyril’s insight while refusing any collapse of the natures. In the Tome to Flavian, Leo’s two axioms are abiding: each nature performs what is proper to it, in communion with the other; and what is common to both is predicated of the person, not ascribing confusion of operations but unity of agent. His language that each form performs what is proper to it guards the ontological integrity of the two natures, while the unity of person ensures that predication is not bifurcated between two acting subjects. Chalcedon ratified this grammar with its dyophysite confession, famously refusing confusion, change, division, or separation. The **communicatio idiomatum** is the verbal correlate of this definition: we predicate according to the person, yet we distinguish according to the natures. Leo’s Tome forestalls the examiner’s classic challenge, how can we say the Lord of glory was crucified. It is the Lord of glory who suffered, and not a mere man, yet the suffering is proper to the assumed humanity through which the Lord of glory acted and was acted upon.

Leontius of Byzantium (fl. mid-sixth century) then supplied a conceptual precision that later tradition would name **enhypostasia** and **anhypostasia**. The humanity of Christ is not a separate hypostasis but subsists in the hypostasis of the Word. The human nature is anhypostatic in the sense that it does not possess a human hypostasis of its own, and enhypostatic in that it is made to subsist in the person of the Son. This insight clarifies the subject of the **communicatio idiomatum**. Because there is no human hypostasis alongside the Word, there is no shuttling of predicates between two persons, and no risk of Nestorian duplication. And because the human nature is complete in its own created integrity, there is no monophysite collapse into an amorphous composite. Enhypostasia secures that the one who walks, learns, suffers, and dies is the eternal Son, now acting humanly. The predicate is always about this person. The rule of **reduplication** thus sits on firm metaphysical footing: according to the divine nature the Son is impassible and omnipresent, according to the human nature he is passible and locally circumscribed, yet all are truly predicated of the one Lord Jesus Christ.

Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) consolidated the traditional insights by tethering predication to a broader metaphysics of act and potency and to a disciplined account of language. In the Summa theologiae, Aquinas argues that person is the ultimate supposit of nature; hence all predication terminates in the person. He rejects any real composition in God and therefore safeguards **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** while allowing for a real union of two creaturesly and divine orders in the person of the Son. Aquinas’s logical grammar is crucial: he distinguishes speaking of Christ absolutely and speaking with a note of **reduplication**. Absolutely, we can say Christ is God and man, omniscient and limited in knowledge, immortal and mortal, without contradiction, because the predicates pertain to different natures united in one person. With reduplication, we say Christ is mortal according to the human nature and immortal according to the divine. The union does not produce a tertium quid, nor does it require a flow of attributes from divinity to humanity. Aquinas also defends an account of operations consonant with **two wills** and **two energies** later defended at Constantinople II and III. The same person acts through two natures and therefore through two sets of operations proper to those natures. This undergirds a traditional second genus often called the genus apotelesmaticum, that theandric works are the single works of the person through both natures, without collapsing the energies. Aquinas thus offers a robust ontology and semantics for the **communicatio idiomatum** that resists both Nestorian division of subjects and Eutychian mixture.

Martin Luther (d. 1546) reframed the debates, making the communication of idioms the battleground of soteriology and sacramentology. In the Disputation concerning the Holy Trinity and the Incarnation and in polemics over the Lord’s Supper, Luther sharpened a view often summarized in the three genera of communication. The first, the genus idiomaticum, accords with Chalcedon: properties of either nature are predicated of the person. The third, the genus apotelesmaticum, affirms the single personal agent of Christ’s mediatorial works. But Luther’s distinctive contribution is the second, the genus maiestaticum, the majestic genus, by which the human nature of Christ participates in, or is communicated, divine majesty by virtue of the personal union. Luther’s christological motive is soteriological assurance and the theology of the cross. For him, only if God himself is involved in the passion can the cross be the theater of saving judgment and mercy. From this he infers that the humanity is not a mere instrument but is permeated by divine glory, commonly expounded as the ubiquity of Christ’s human body after exaltation. This supports real presence in the Eucharist as the body of Christ being present wherever his promise locates it.

Luther’s instinct that the predicates of suffering and glory belong to the one who is God is deeply Cyrilline, and his pastoral polemics against a Nestorianizing separation of acts retain real force. Yet the genus maiestaticum stretches the older rule into an ontological claim of property transference between natures. Reformed and Roman Catholic scholastics protest that this exceeds the logical communication of names to the person, proposing instead a transmutation in the humanity. The Reformed will object that Luther has conflated personal union with a new mode of the human nature that erases its finitude, violating Chalcedon’s property clause and compromising the very reality of human obedience and suffering by which we are saved. Examiners will press whether this makes the Reformed view Nestorian. The answer requires turning to John Calvin.

John Calvin (d. 1564) articulates a Chalcedonian **communicatio idiomatum** that both insists on person-centered predication and secures the created integrity of Christ’s humanity, adding a distinctive emphasis on the **extra Calvinisticum**. For Calvin, the Son is truly united to our nature in the unity of person, and therefore whatever is predicated of either nature can be said of the person. He refuses any transfusion of properties between the natures, and he guards the finite as truly finite. The extra Calvinisticum names the truth that the eternal Word is never confined to the flesh he assumed. The Son as to his divine nature remains infinite, omnipresent, and impassible even while truly united to the assumed humanity. This extra is not a second person outside the incarnation but the same person according to his divine mode of being. Calvin therefore denies the ubiquity of Christ’s human body and anchors **sacramental presence** in the Spirit’s agency, the believer’s ascent to the ascended Christ, and the true communion effected by the Spirit, rather than in a local presence of the body on the altar. His insistence on real human limitations is not an evasion of the communicatio but its necessary condition. Only what is not assumed is not healed, and what is assumed must be truly human. If the human nature is dissolved into ubiquity, we do not safeguard the redemptive history of a particular obedience, suffering, death, and resurrection. Calvin’s exegesis of texts such as Acts 20, the church of God purchased with his blood, follows the classic pattern: the predicate blood pertains to the humanity, the subject is the person who is God. The strength of Calvin’s position is that he can say, with real depth, God died for us, while preserving **impassibility** by adding the necessary **reduplication** in the flesh. He answers the Nestorian charge by stressing enhypostasia: there is no human person of Jesus beside the Word, so there is no division of agents.

At this point the internal debates can be ordered. Within the patristic trajectory, the Alexandrian desire for unity of person and the Antiochene insistence on the integrity of the humanity had to be fused. Chalcedon and Leo’s Tome achieved this equilibrium by defining union without confusion and distinction without division, and the **communicatio idiomatum** was the linguistic corollary. The Byzantine development with Leontius and later Maximus deepened the metaphysics with **enhypostasia** and with two wills and energies, ensuring that predication followed real ontological structures of the union. Medieval scholastics like Aquinas disciplined predication with **reduplication** so that paradoxical statements about Christ were neither empty rhetoric nor covert contradictions. The Reformation reopened the field by bringing the communicatio to bear on assurance and the Supper. Luther’s genus maiestaticum sought to make the divine involvement in the cross as immediate as possible and to ground real presence in the exalted humanity. The Reformed responded that the older rule permits us to say everything the gospel requires without any transfer of properties that would either un-deify the Son or de-humanize the humanity. This is the crux of the internal Protestant debate.

External debates reveal why the doctrine matters. Nestorian tendencies split predicates across two subjects, undermining the unity of the mediator. If Mary is not Theotokos and if the blood shed is not the blood of the Son, then the cross ceases to be the work of God for us. Eutychian or monophysite tendencies collapse the natures and erase the integrity of either nature, threatening both genuine human obedience and the immutable blessedness of God. Monothelite and monenergist proposals reduce the complexity of Christ’s operations and undermine his priestly obedience. Against all these, the **communicatio idiomatum** insists that God acts in and through the assumed humanity without ceasing to be God and without ceasing to act divinely. The person who is God the Son truly suffers and dies humanly. The person who is a man truly forgives sins and is omnipotent divinely. The unity of the subject is soteriologically decisive.

Contemporary proposals test the doctrine at key pressure points. Kenotic Christologies assert that the Son suspended or divested himself of certain divine attributes to be genuinely human. This directly conflicts with **divine simplicity** and **immutability**, and it steals from the **communicatio idiomatum** the very tool for saying God suffered without making the divine nature passible. The older rule provides a richer account: the Son can be genuinely limited according to his human nature without any subtraction from his divinity. Another pressure point is the claim that God suffered or that the Trinity is passible. Here the communicatio functions as a precision instrument. We must distinguish between the true claim that the person who is God suffered humanly and the false claim that the divine nature as such suffered. To abandon this distinction is to forsake the very unity in distinction that makes the gospel coherent. A third pressure point is analytic models of Christ’s consciousness, such as two-minds accounts, which attempt to interpret how one person can act with fully human consciousness and divine omniscience. While such models may illuminate the mode of operations, they must be subordinated to the **principle of predication** that the person is the single agent of all actions and passions and that predicates of either nature terminate in the person. The old rule controls and bounds any speculative model.

Examiners will press several standard objections. Does the Reformed denial of the genus maiestaticum diminish the presence of Christ in the Supper or distance God from the cross. The answer is that the communicatio already allows us to say that the Son of God is the agent and patient of the whole economy. The denial concerns the transference of divine attributes to the humanity, not the truth that the person who is God is present and active in and through his humanity. The Supper’s realism is anchored not in ubiquity of the body but in the Spirit’s agency who unites believers to the ascended Christ and makes us participants in his true body and blood. Does the extra Calvinisticum introduce a second person or a divided Christ. No. It is a consequence of the axiom that the infinite cannot be circumscribed by the finite and that the Word did not evacuate his divine mode of being in assuming flesh. The extra names the truth that the Son is both truly united to the humanity and, according to his divinity, remains beyond it. Does the formula God died entail that the divine nature suffered. No, because the subject is the person and the mode is specified by nature. The one who died is God the Son, yet he died according to the human nature. This is not a mere verbal evasion. It is the very meaning of **hypostatic union**.

The positive case for the Chalcedonian–Reformed position may be made in three strokes. First, it secures doctrinal coherence across loci. Only a person-centered **communicatio idiomatum** preserves **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** while allowing for real incarnation and real human growth, suffering, and death. The divine nature cannot acquire human properties without ceasing to be simple and immutable; the human nature cannot acquire divine properties without ceasing to be a creature. Second, it preserves the soteriological structure of the gospel. A Christ whose humanity is dissolved into ubiquity loses the concrete obedience and historical particularity by which he is our covenant head. The obedience that is counted to us is creaturely obedience, the death that atones is a human death, and the resurrection that is the firstfruits is a human resurrection, all belonging to the person of the Son. Third, it provides stable sacramental and doxological practice. We can confess the true presence of Christ in the Supper and worship the one Lord of glory without confusing the modes of presence or collapsing the Creator-creature distinction.

This case also clarifies the function of the older distinctions. **Reduplication** is not a scholastic tic but the grammar of preaching. To say God died is not sensational but catechetical, so long as we add in the flesh. **Enhypostasia** is not an arcane metaphysical theory but the anchor that prevents Nestorian duality of subjects. The appeal to **two wills** and **theandric operations** respects the complexity of the one person acting through two natures. The rejection of the genus maiestaticum is not timidity about divine involvement but reverence for the integrity of the human nature and the transcendence of the divine. And the **extra Calvinisticum** is not a Reformed invention but a Catholic implication of the infinity of God, already present in the fathers.

Return now to our decisive figures and what they supply for an oral defense. Cyril gives you the courage to say that the Word himself suffered, and he gives you the tool to qualify without retreat. Leo gives you the balance that prevents Alexandrian zeal from hardening into a monophysite slippage. Leontius gives you the ontological footing that secures unity of subject without denying a complete human nature. Aquinas teaches you how predication works, so that apparent contradictions are resolved into ordered reduplication. Luther reminds you that Christology lives in soteriology and that the communicatio is about assurance and the cross. Calvin supplies a disciplined alternative to the genus maiestaticum and a eucharistic realism aligned to **federal theology** and the Spirit’s agency. Together they offer the grammar, metaphysics, and pastoral force of the doctrine.

The examiner may finally ask whether communicatio idiomatum is a mere linguistic convention or a metaphysical truth. The answer is that it is both a semantic rule and an ontological claim. It is semantic in that it governs how we speak truly about Christ, attaching predicates to the person and qualifying according to natures. It is ontological in that this speech follows the real union of two natures in one person. The rule is not a make-believe patch on contradictions but the articulation of what is objectively the case in the **hypostatic union**. Or they may ask whether the two-natures grammar blocks real divine empathy. The reply is to reject the conflation of empathy with passibility. The Son as man knows our sorrows experimentally and compassionately in a human mode, and as God he is present to all his creatures and their sufferings by omnipresent knowledge and power, without ceasing to be blessed. The gospel does not require a passible divine nature, it requires a person who is God to assume a passible human nature for us and our salvation.

To hold this position is not to refuse mystery but to refuse confusion. The church speaks paradoxically about Christ because the one person is the locus of two sets of properties and operations that would contravene one another if predicated of a single nature. But they are not predicated of a single nature. They are predicated of a single person according to two natures. This is what the **communicatio idiomatum** confesses and enforces. It preserves the Creator-creature distinction and the evangel. It lets us say without hesitation that God was born, God hungered, God died, God rose, and God reigns, and to say each with the sober qualifier that keeps the faith whole: in the flesh, according to the human nature, by the same person who is eternally and immutably the Son.
