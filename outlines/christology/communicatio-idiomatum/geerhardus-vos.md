# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos, as a Reformed biblical theologian, affirmed the **communicatio idiomatum** within the context of classic **Chalcedonian Christology**, emphasizing the unity of the **person of Christ** while maintaining the distinction between the **divine and human natures**. Vos upheld the Reformed tradition’s insistence that the **attributes** of each nature are truly predicated of the one person, yet without confusion or mixture, and he integrated this doctrine into his broader understanding of **redemptive history** and **covenant theology**.

- "The communicatio idiomatum is not a confusion of the natures, but a predication of the properties of both natures to the one person." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Christology
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus: The Modern Debate about the Messianic Consciousness
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (essay)
- Pauline Eschatology (for implications in Christ’s person and work)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Chalcedonian Framework Maintained**
    - Affirms the **two natures** of Christ, divine and human, united in one person.
    - Rejects any **mixture or confusion** of the natures in the communicatio idiomatum.
    - Emphasizes the **hypostatic union** as the basis for attributing properties of both natures to the person.
    - Insists that the communicatio idiomatum safeguards both the full deity and full humanity of Christ.
    - "The union is personal, not essential; the natures remain distinct, yet are inseparably joined in the one person." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Predication to the Person, Not the Natures**
    - Attributes of both natures are predicated of the **person** of Christ, not directly of the natures themselves.
    - This predication is possible because of the **personal union** established at the incarnation.
    - Avoids Nestorianism by refusing to divide the subject of predication.
    - Ensures that statements like "God suffered" are true only as they refer to the person, not the divine nature as such.
    - "It is the person who acts and suffers, not the abstract nature." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Scriptural Foundation for the Doctrine**
    - Grounds the communicatio idiomatum in biblical passages that attribute divine and human properties to Christ.
    - Highlights texts such as Acts 20:28 and John 1:14 as evidence for the doctrine.
    - Sees the biblical witness as supporting the unity of Christ’s person in all his works.
    - Integrates the doctrine into the broader biblical narrative of redemption.
    - "Scripture speaks of the Son as both sent and sending, suffering and reigning, in one undivided subject." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Significance**
    - Connects the communicatio idiomatum to the accomplishment of **redemption**.
    - Argues that only one who is both truly God and truly man can mediate between God and humanity.
    - Sees the unity of Christ’s person as essential for the efficacy of his atoning work.
    - Relates the doctrine to the unfolding of **covenant history** and the fulfillment of God’s promises.
    - "The work of redemption requires a mediator who is both God and man in one person, acting in both natures." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Rejection of Lutheran Extra Calvinisticum**
    - Distinguishes the Reformed view from the Lutheran position on the communication of attributes.
    - Denies that the human nature of Christ is omnipresent, preserving the integrity of both natures.
    - Asserts that the divine nature is not limited or altered by the incarnation.
    - Maintains that the communicatio idiomatum does not entail a transfer of properties between natures.
    - "The Reformed doctrine refuses to ascribe divine attributes to the human nature as such." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** reinforced the Reformed commitment to the integrity of both Christ’s natures and the unity of his person, shaping twentieth-century Reformed Christology. His biblical-theological approach integrated this doctrine into the broader sweep of **redemptive history**, influencing generations of theologians at Westminster and beyond. Vos’s careful distinctions continue to inform contemporary discussions on the person and work of Christ, ensuring the doctrine’s ongoing relevance in systematic theology.
