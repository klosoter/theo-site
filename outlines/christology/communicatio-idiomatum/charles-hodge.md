# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, affirmed the **communicatio idiomatum** as a necessary implication of the **hypostatic union** in Christology. He maintained that the **divine** and **human natures** of Christ remain distinct yet are united in the one **person** of the Son, allowing for the true predication of attributes from both natures to the single person of Christ.

- "The properties of both natures are attributed to the one person, so that He is called God and man, exalted and humbled, omnipotent and weak, ignorant and omniscient." (Systematic Theology, II.397)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- The Way of Life
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Princeton Review articles on Christology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Hypostatic Union Maintained**
    - Christ possesses both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
    - These two natures are inseparably united in the one **person** of the Son.
    - The union does not result in a mixture or confusion of the natures.
    - The **person** of Christ is the proper subject of all actions and experiences.
    - "The two natures are united, not mingled; they constitute one person, not two." (Systematic Theology, II.390)

2. **Predication of Attributes**
    - Attributes of both natures can be truly predicated of the one person.
    - Christ can be called both **God** and **man** without contradiction.
    - The person acts according to either nature, but always as one subject.
    - This predication is grounded in the unity of the person, not in a transfer of properties.
    - "Whatever may be true of either nature, is true of the person." (Systematic Theology, II.397)

3. **Rejection of Eutychianism and Nestorianism**
    - Hodge rejects any confusion or fusion of the natures (Eutychianism).
    - He also rejects the division of Christ into two persons (Nestorianism).
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** safeguards against both errors.
    - True union means the properties remain proper to each nature, but are attributed to the person.
    - "The doctrine guards equally against the errors of Nestorius and Eutyches." (Systematic Theology, II.391)

4. **Scriptural Foundation**
    - Hodge grounds the doctrine in biblical passages attributing divine and human properties to Christ.
    - He appeals to texts where Christ is described with both **divine** and **human** predicates.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is seen as a biblical necessity for orthodox Christology.
    - Scripture’s testimony is decisive for the formulation of this doctrine.
    - "The Scriptures attribute to Christ all the attributes of God and all the attributes of man." (Systematic Theology, II.397)

5. **Implications for Redemption**
    - The unity of person ensures the efficacy of Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - Only one who is both **God** and **man** can truly redeem.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** undergirds the value of Christ’s obedience and suffering.
    - The doctrine safeguards the reality of both Christ’s divinity and humanity in redemption.
    - "It is the person who obeys, suffers, and dies, and that person is God manifest in the flesh." (Systematic Theology, II.397)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** became a standard reference point for Reformed Christology in the English-speaking world. His careful distinction between **nature** and **person** influenced generations of theologians at Princeton and beyond. By grounding the doctrine in both Scripture and the historic creeds, Hodge helped preserve orthodox Christological formulations against modernist and rationalist tendencies. His work remains a touchstone for discussions of the **hypostatic union** and the person of Christ in Reformed theology.
