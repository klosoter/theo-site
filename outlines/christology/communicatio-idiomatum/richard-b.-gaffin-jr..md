# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the **communicatio idiomatum** as a vital aspect of **Christology**, emphasizing the unity of the **person of Christ** and the proper distinction between his **divine and human natures**. He situates the doctrine within the broader framework of **Reformed theology**, highlighting its implications for the **work of Christ** and the believer’s **union with Christ**.

- "The communicatio idiomatum is not a communication of properties between the natures but a communication of the properties of both natures to the one person." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Articles in Westminster Theological Journal on Christology and the person of Christ

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Personal Union of Christ**
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is grounded in the hypostatic union, where the **divine and human natures** are united in the one person of Christ.
    - The properties of each nature are ascribed to the person, not transferred between natures.
    - This union preserves the full integrity of both natures without confusion or separation.
    - The doctrine safeguards the reality of Christ’s true humanity and true deity.
    - "The unity of the person is the basis for the communication of idioms, not a fusion of natures." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Reformed Christological Distinctives**
    - Gaffin affirms the classic Reformed rejection of the Lutheran "genus maiestaticum" (communication of divine attributes to the human nature).
    - He insists that the **communicatio idiomatum** is a communication to the person, not a mingling of natures.
    - The doctrine is essential for maintaining the Chalcedonian definition.
    - It undergirds the Reformed understanding of Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "Reformed theology has consistently maintained that the communicatio idiomatum is personal, not natural." (Westminster Theological Journal)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is not merely a metaphysical assertion but is integral to the history of redemption.
    - Christ’s person and work must be understood in the context of his resurrection and exaltation.
    - The doctrine has implications for the believer’s participation in Christ’s benefits.
    - It connects the incarnation to the application of salvation.
    - "The communicatio idiomatum is inseparable from the redemptive-historical accomplishment and application of salvation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Union with Christ**
    - The reality of the **communicatio idiomatum** undergirds the believer’s union with the risen Christ.
    - It ensures that the benefits of Christ’s work are truly communicated to believers.
    - The doctrine shapes the Reformed ordo salutis, especially in relation to justification and sanctification.
    - It highlights the ongoing significance of Christ’s person for the Christian life.
    - "Union with Christ is grounded in the unique person who possesses both divine and human natures." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Scriptural Foundation**
    - Gaffin grounds the doctrine in careful exegesis of key biblical texts (e.g., John 1, Philippians 2, Hebrews 2).
    - He emphasizes the biblical witness to the unity and distinction in Christ’s person.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is not speculative but arises from the scriptural narrative.
    - Scripture provides the categories for understanding the relationship between Christ’s natures.
    - "The New Testament presents the person of Christ as the subject of all his acts and experiences, divine and human." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions of **Christology** and the doctrine of **union with Christ**. His work has reinforced the importance of maintaining Chalcedonian categories while applying them within a redemptive-historical framework. Gaffin’s influence is evident in the ongoing emphasis on the unity of Christ’s person and the practical implications for soteriology in Reformed theology.
