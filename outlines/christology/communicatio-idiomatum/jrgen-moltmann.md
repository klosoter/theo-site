# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches the **communicatio idiomatum** through his distinctive **trinitarian theology** and **eschatological Christology**, emphasizing the dynamic relationship between the divine and human natures of Christ. He interprets the communication of attributes not as a static metaphysical exchange, but as a revelation of God's self-giving in the **history of salvation**, especially through the **cross** and **resurrection**.

- "The communication of idioms is not a static exchange of properties, but the history of God’s participation in human suffering and human participation in God’s life." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- Jesus Christ for Today’s World (1990)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Reinterpretation of Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - Frames the communication of attributes within the **relational dynamics of the Trinity**.
    - Emphasizes the mutual indwelling (**perichoresis**) of divine and human in Christ.
    - Argues that the doctrine reveals the openness of God to the world.
    - Sees the cross as the central event where divine and human realities are most profoundly communicated.
    - "The trinitarian history of God is the presupposition for the communication of idioms in Christ." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

2. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - Interprets the communicatio idiomatum as oriented toward the **future consummation** of all things.
    - Views Christ’s resurrection as the guarantee of the ultimate union between God and humanity.
    - Connects the doctrine to the **hope** of new creation and transformation.
    - Stresses that the communication of attributes is not just past, but ongoing in the Spirit.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the anticipation of the communication of all things to God." (Theology of Hope)

3. **Theology of the Cross and Divine Suffering**
    - Centers the communicatio idiomatum on the **event of the cross**.
    - Argues that in Christ’s suffering, God truly experiences human pain.
    - Maintains that the divine capacity to suffer is revealed through the union of natures.
    - Suggests that the cross is where the communication of idioms is most existentially real.
    - "God allows himself to be affected by the world, and this is the deepest meaning of the communication of idioms." (The Crucified God)

4. **Participation and Solidarity**
    - Stresses that communicatio idiomatum enables **human participation in the divine life**.
    - Sees Christ as the mediator who brings humanity into fellowship with God.
    - Argues that the doctrine grounds Christian hope for transformation and liberation.
    - Connects the communication of attributes to the church’s mission of solidarity with the suffering.
    - "Through Christ’s humanity, we are drawn into the life of God." (Jesus Christ for Today’s World)

5. **Critique of Classical Metaphysics**
    - Challenges traditional metaphysical accounts of the doctrine as static or abstract.
    - Proposes a more dynamic, historical, and relational understanding.
    - Emphasizes the existential and practical implications for faith and ethics.
    - Sees the communicatio idiomatum as a call to transformative engagement with the world.
    - "The communication of idioms must be understood in the context of God’s history with the world, not in abstract ontological terms." (Experiences in Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach to the **communicatio idiomatum** has significantly influenced contemporary **trinitarian theology** and Christology, especially in ecumenical and liberationist circles. By linking the doctrine to the **suffering of God** and the hope of new creation, he has expanded its relevance for theological reflection on suffering, justice, and eschatology. His dynamic, relational interpretation continues to shape discussions on the meaning of the incarnation and the church’s participation in God’s mission.
