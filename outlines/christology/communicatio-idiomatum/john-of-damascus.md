# John of Damascus (c. 675–749)

John of Damascus provided a foundational articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** within the context of **Chalcedonian Christology**, emphasizing the unity of the **divine and human natures** in the one **Person of Christ**. He argued that the properties of both natures are truly predicated of the one **hypostasis** of the Word, without confusion or separation, thus safeguarding both the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ.

- "We do not say that the flesh became God, but that it was united to God, and became the flesh of God the Word." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.8)

## Key Works

- Exposition of the Orthodox Faith (De Fide Orthodoxa)
- Dialogue Against the Manicheans
- Homilies on the Nativity and Dormition of Mary
- On Heresies

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Hypostatic Union as the Basis for Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - The **divine and human natures** are united in the one **hypostasis** of Christ.
    - This union is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - The properties of each nature remain distinct but are truly attributed to the one Person.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is possible only because of the hypostatic union.
    - "For the one Christ is both God and man, perfect God and perfect man, the same being of a rational soul and body." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.3)

2. **Distinction and Integrity of the Two Natures**
    - The divine and human natures retain their own properties after the union.
    - There is no mingling or alteration of the natures.
    - Each nature acts according to its own properties within the one Person.
    - The communicatio idiomatum does not imply a blending of natures.
    - "Each nature wills and acts in communion with the other, but according to its own properties." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.19)

3. **Predication of Properties to the One Person**
    - It is proper to attribute both divine and human actions and experiences to the one Christ.
    - The subject of all actions is the one hypostasis of the Word.
    - Divine attributes (e.g., omnipotence) and human attributes (e.g., suffering) are both truly predicated of Christ.
    - This predication avoids Nestorian separation and Eutychian confusion.
    - "We may say that God suffered, but not in His divinity, but in the flesh." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.27)

4. **Theological Safeguards Against Heresy**
    - The communicatio idiomatum upholds the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ.
    - It rejects both Nestorianism (separation of persons) and Monophysitism (confusion of natures).
    - The doctrine is grounded in the decisions of the **Council of Chalcedon**.
    - It preserves the mystery of the Incarnation without rationalistic reduction.
    - "We confess one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only-begotten, made known in two natures." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.3)

5. **Soteriological Significance**
    - The communicatio idiomatum is essential for the reality of redemption.
    - Only one who is both fully God and fully man can mediate salvation.
    - The union enables Christ’s human actions (e.g., suffering, death) to have divine efficacy.
    - The faithful can truly say that "God suffered" and "God died" in the flesh.
    - "For He who suffered was not a mere man, but God incarnate." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.27)

## Legacy and Impact

John of Damascus’s articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** became a cornerstone for later Eastern Orthodox and Western Christological formulations. His careful distinction between **nature** and **person** influenced both medieval and Reformation theology, providing a robust framework for understanding the unity and distinction in Christ. His work remains a touchstone for ecumenical dialogue and doctrinal clarity regarding the Incarnation.
