# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til addressed the **communicatio idiomatum** within his **Reformed Christology** and **presuppositional apologetics**, emphasizing the unity of the person of Christ while maintaining the distinction between the **divine and human natures**. He insisted that the communication of properties occurs only in the person, not between the natures themselves, safeguarding the **Chalcedonian definition** and the **self-attesting Christ of Scripture**.

- "The attributes of both natures belong to the one person, Jesus Christ, but the natures themselves do not intermingle or change." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Person as the Subject of Predication**
    - The **person of Christ** is the proper subject to whom both divine and human attributes are ascribed.
    - The **natures** retain their distinct properties and are not confused or mingled.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** safeguards the unity of Christ’s person in all his actions and experiences.
    - This commitment is rooted in the **Chalcedonian formula**.
    "The properties of each nature are truly predicated of the one person, not of the natures themselves." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Rejection of Nature-to-Nature Communication**
    - Van Til insists that attributes are not transferred from one nature to the other.
    - The **divine nature** does not become human, nor does the **human nature** become divine.
    - This guards against both **Nestorianism** and **Eutychianism**.
    - The distinction of natures is preserved even as their properties are predicated of the person.
    "There is no communication of properties from one nature to the other, but only to the person." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Scriptural Foundation for Christological Formulations**
    - Van Til grounds the doctrine in the **biblical witness** to Christ’s person and work.
    - He emphasizes the **self-attesting Christ of Scripture** as the starting point for theology.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is not a speculative doctrine but one derived from revelation.
    - Christ’s unique personhood is revealed in both his divine prerogatives and human experiences.
    "We must always begin with the Christ of Scripture, who is both God and man in one person." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Apologetic Significance of Christ’s Person**
    - The unity and distinction in Christ are essential for a **Reformed apologetic**.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** demonstrates the coherence of the Christian worldview.
    - Attacks on Christ’s person undermine the possibility of knowledge and redemption.
    - Van Til uses this doctrine to defend the **absolute authority of Christ**.
    "Only the Christ who is truly God and truly man can be the foundation of all knowledge." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Analogy and Mystery in Christology**
    - Van Til acknowledges the **mystery** inherent in the union of two natures in one person.
    - He employs the **Creator-creature distinction** to frame the limits of human understanding.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is affirmed analogically, not univocally.
    - This approach maintains reverence for the incomprehensibility of the Incarnation.
    "We must speak analogically of the union of natures, never reducing the mystery to human categories." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** has shaped Reformed approaches to **Christology** and apologetics, emphasizing the inseparability of doctrinal fidelity and presuppositional method. His insistence on the unity of Christ’s person and the distinction of natures has influenced generations of theologians defending orthodox Christology against both modernist and traditional errors. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to a robust, biblically grounded understanding of the person and work of Christ.
