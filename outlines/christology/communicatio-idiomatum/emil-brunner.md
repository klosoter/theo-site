# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **communicatio idiomatum** from the perspective of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the paradoxical unity and distinction of the **divine and human natures** in Christ. He rejected both a **Scholastic** fusion of natures and a **Nestorian** separation, insisting that the communication of attributes must be understood in light of the **personal union** (unio hypostatica) rather than as a metaphysical exchange. Brunner’s Christology sought to preserve the mystery of the Incarnation while safeguarding the genuine humanity and divinity of Christ.

- "The union of God and man in Christ is not a mixture of natures, but the personal union of the divine Logos with true humanity." (The Mediator)

## Key Works

- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Dogmatics, Volume II: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Christian Doctrine of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Personal Union, Not Mixture**
    - Christ’s two natures are united in the one person of the **Logos**.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is grounded in the personal union, not a blending of divine and human properties.
    - Brunner rejects any notion that the divine nature is altered or diminished by the union.
    - The union is a mystery that cannot be fully explained by philosophical categories.
    - "The union of the two natures in Christ is a personal, not a substantial, union." (The Mediator)

2. **Rejection of Metaphysical Transfer**
    - Attributes of one nature are not transferred to the other nature.
    - The communication is not a metaphysical exchange but a relational reality in the person of Christ.
    - Brunner opposes both **Eutychianism** (fusion) and **Nestorianism** (separation).
    - The divine and human properties remain distinct yet are truly united in the person.
    - "The properties of the divine and human natures are not interchanged, but are united in the one person." (Dogmatics II)

3. **Christ as the Revelation of God**
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** serves the purpose of divine self-revelation.
    - In Christ, God truly reveals Himself in human history without ceasing to be God.
    - The unity of natures enables Christ to be the true Mediator between God and humanity.
    - The Incarnation is the event in which God’s Word becomes genuinely accessible to humanity.
    - "In Jesus Christ, God has spoken to man in a human way, without ceasing to be God." (The Mediator)

4. **Preservation of True Humanity and True Deity**
    - Brunner insists on the full reality of both Christ’s humanity and divinity.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** must not compromise either nature.
    - Christ’s human experiences are genuinely human, not merely appearances.
    - The divine nature remains transcendent even in the Incarnation.
    - "Only if Christ is truly God and truly man can He be the Mediator." (The Mediator)

5. **Mystery and Paradox in Christology**
    - The union of natures is ultimately a mystery that defies rational explanation.
    - Brunner emphasizes the paradoxical character of the Incarnation.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** points to the limits of human understanding in theology.
    - Faith accepts the mystery rather than resolving it through speculation.
    - "The mystery of Christ is the mystery of God with us, which we can only confess, not explain." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to the **communicatio idiomatum** influenced modern Protestant Christology by emphasizing the existential and relational dimensions of the Incarnation. His insistence on the **personal union** and rejection of metaphysical speculation shaped subsequent discussions on the unity of Christ’s natures. Brunner’s dialectical method and focus on revelation continue to inform contemporary theology, especially in debates over the nature of Christ’s person and work. His legacy endures in the ongoing effort to articulate the mystery of the Incarnation within the framework of **Reformed theology**.
