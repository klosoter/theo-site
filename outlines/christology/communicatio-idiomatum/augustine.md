# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **communicatio idiomatum** is foundational for Western Christology, rooted in his understanding of the **Incarnation** and the **hypostatic union**. He insists that the attributes of both the **divine** and **human** natures are truly predicated of the one **Person of the Word**, while carefully preserving the distinction between the natures.

- "For both natures are united in one person, so that both are together the one Christ, God and man." (On the Trinity, I.7)

## Key Works

- On the Trinity (De Trinitate)
- Sermons (especially Sermon 187)
- Letters (notably Letter 137 to Volusianus)
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- Enchiridion

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Person in Christ**
    - Christ is one **Person**, not a fusion of two persons.
    - Both **divine** and **human** natures subsist in the one Christ.
    - The unity of person allows for the predication of attributes from both natures.
    - The subject of all actions and sufferings is the **Word**.
    "For the Word was made flesh, not by the conversion of God into flesh, but by the assumption of flesh by God into His own unity." (On the Trinity, I.7)

2. **Distinction of Natures Maintained**
    - The **divine** and **human** natures remain distinct, unconfused, and unmingled.
    - Each nature retains its own properties and operations.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** does not imply a change in either nature.
    - The distinction is essential for true mediation and **redemption**.
    "He took upon Him the form of a servant, yet without losing the form of God." (Sermon 187)

3. **Predication of Properties**
    - Properties of both natures can be truly predicated of the one **Person**.
    - Scriptural language often attributes human experiences to the divine subject.
    - This predication is grounded in the **hypostatic union**.
    - Augustine uses biblical examples (e.g., "the Lord of glory was crucified").
    "We say that Christ, the Son of God, was crucified, though it was in the flesh that He suffered." (Letter 137)

4. **Role of the Incarnation**
    - The **Incarnation** is the basis for the communication of properties.
    - The eternal **Word** assumed a complete human nature.
    - The union is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is possible only because of this union.
    "The Word became flesh, that is, God became man, not by changing what He was, but by assuming what He was not." (On the Trinity, XIII.17)

5. **Soteriological Implications**
    - The true union of natures is necessary for **redemption**.
    - Only one who is both **God and man** can mediate between God and humanity.
    - The communication of properties undergirds the efficacy of Christ’s work.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** ensures the reality of both divine initiative and human participation in salvation.
    "For unless the Mediator between God and men took upon Him the nature of both, He could not reconcile them." (Enchiridion, 36)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** profoundly shaped Western Christology, influencing the development of doctrine at councils such as Chalcedon. His careful balance of unity and distinction in Christ’s person and natures provided a framework for later theologians, including Aquinas and the Reformers. The Augustinian emphasis on the **hypostatic union** remains a cornerstone in discussions of Christ’s person and work.
