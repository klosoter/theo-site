# Sinclair Ferguson (1948–)

Sinclair Ferguson, a contemporary Reformed theologian, affirms the classical doctrine of **communicatio idiomatum** as essential to a robust **Christology**. He upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition**, emphasizing the union of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**, and insists that the properties of each nature are truly communicated to the person, not confused or mingled. Ferguson’s approach is marked by careful attention to **biblical exegesis** and the **Reformed confessional tradition**.

- "The communicatio idiomatum is not a confusion of the natures, but the attribution of the properties of both natures to the one person of Christ." (The Holy Spirit)

## Key Works

- The Holy Spirit (especially chapters on Christology)
- The Whole Christ
- In Christ Alone: Living the Gospel Centered Life
- “The Reformed View” in Christian Spirituality: Five Views of Sanctification
- Some Pastoral Reflections on the Person of Christ (articles and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Upholding the Chalcedonian Christology**
    - Affirms the distinction and union of **divine and human natures** in Christ.
    - Insists that the **person of the Son** is the subject of all Christ’s actions and experiences.
    - Rejects any confusion, change, division, or separation of the natures.
    - Emphasizes the importance of the **hypostatic union** for salvation.
    - "The two natures are united in the one person without confusion, change, division, or separation." (The Holy Spirit)

2. **Communicatio Idiomatum as Personal, Not Essential**
    - Attributes of each nature are predicated of the **person**, not directly of the other nature.
    - The **Son of God** truly suffers, dies, and rises as man, while remaining fully divine.
    - Avoids Eutychian or Nestorian errors by maintaining the integrity of both natures.
    - The communication is real, but always according to the mode of the respective nature.
    - "The communicatio idiomatum is a communication of the properties of the natures to the person, not a mixing of the natures themselves." (The Holy Spirit)

3. **Scriptural Foundation for the Doctrine**
    - Grounds the doctrine in passages like **John 1:14**, **Acts 20:28**, and **Hebrews 2:14**.
    - Argues that biblical language attributes divine and human actions to the one Christ.
    - Stresses the importance of **biblical exegesis** for doctrinal formulation.
    - Sees the doctrine as necessary for understanding the work of Christ in redemption.
    - "Scripture speaks of the blood of God and the suffering of the Lord of glory, showing the unity of Christ’s person." (The Holy Spirit)

4. **Reformed Confessional Alignment**
    - Follows the **Westminster Confession of Faith** and **Heidelberg Catechism** on Christ’s person.
    - Emphasizes the **extra Calvinisticum**: the Son’s divine nature is not limited to the flesh.
    - Rejects Lutheran “ubiquity” of Christ’s human nature in the Lord’s Supper.
    - Sees the doctrine as safeguarding both the reality of the incarnation and the transcendence of God.
    - "The Reformed tradition carefully distinguishes the natures while affirming their union in the person." (The Whole Christ)

5. **Pastoral and Soteriological Significance**
    - Connects the doctrine to the assurance of **salvation** and the believer’s union with Christ.
    - Argues that only one who is truly God and truly man can mediate between God and humanity.
    - Sees the communicatio idiomatum as vital for understanding Christ’s sympathy and intercession.
    - Applies the doctrine to Christian living and worship, stressing Christ’s ongoing ministry.
    - "Our salvation depends on the reality that the one person, Jesus Christ, is both God and man for us." (In Christ Alone)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s exposition of the **communicatio idiomatum** has helped clarify this doctrine for a new generation of Reformed pastors and scholars. His work bridges rigorous **systematic theology** and practical pastoral application, ensuring that the doctrine is not merely theoretical but vital for Christian faith and life. By rooting his teaching in both **Scripture** and the **Reformed confessions**, Ferguson has strengthened contemporary understanding of the person and work of Christ.
