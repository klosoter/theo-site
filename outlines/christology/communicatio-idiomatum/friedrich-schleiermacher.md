# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the **communicatio idiomatum** within his broader project of **Christological reconstruction**, emphasizing the unity of Christ’s person over traditional metaphysical distinctions. He critiqued classical formulations of the **two natures** in Christ, instead grounding the communication of attributes in the unique **God-consciousness** realized in Jesus. Schleiermacher’s approach shifted the focus from ontological categories to the experiential and redemptive significance of Christ.

- "The Redeemer is distinguished from all other men by the constant potency of his God-consciousness, which was a veritable existence of God in him." (The Christian Faith, §94)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redefinition of the Two Natures**
    - Christ’s **divinity and humanity** are united in the consciousness of absolute dependence.
    - Rejects metaphysical speculation about the union of natures.
    - The **God-consciousness** is the locus of the divine in Christ.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is interpreted existentially, not ontologically.
    - "The divine attributes are not transferred to the human nature, but are manifest in the unique God-consciousness of Christ." (The Christian Faith, §94)

2. **Primacy of God-Consciousness**
    - Christ’s uniqueness lies in the perfect realization of **God-consciousness**.
    - This consciousness is the medium for the communication of divine and human attributes.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is the expression of this consciousness in historical existence.
    - The unity of person is psychological, not metaphysical.
    - "In Him the divine essence is communicated to human nature through the immediacy of God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §96)

3. **Functional Christology**
    - Emphasizes the **redemptive function** of Christ over ontological status.
    - The significance of communicatio idiomatum is soteriological, not speculative.
    - Christ’s role as Redeemer is grounded in his exemplary God-consciousness.
    - The communication of attributes is meaningful in the context of salvation history.
    - "The Redeemer’s influence is the communication of his God-consciousness to the community." (The Christian Faith, §106)

4. **Critique of Classical Formulations**
    - Challenges the Chalcedonian definition as philosophically outdated.
    - Argues that traditional **hypostatic union** categories are inadequate.
    - Seeks to reinterpret communicatio idiomatum in light of modern consciousness.
    - Prioritizes religious experience over metaphysical explanation.
    - "The Church’s dogmatic expressions must be reinterpreted in terms of religious self-consciousness." (On the Glaubenslehre)

5. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - Stresses the indivisible unity of Christ’s person.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is possible because of this unity, not as a transfer between natures.
    - The person of Christ is the subject of all predicates, divine and human.
    - The unity is dynamic, realized in the historical life of Jesus.
    - "All predicates, whether divine or human, are ascribed to the one person of Christ, not to the natures in abstraction." (The Christian Faith, §97)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of the **communicatio idiomatum** profoundly influenced modern **Christology**, shifting the discussion from metaphysical speculation to the realm of religious experience and consciousness. His approach paved the way for later liberal and existential theologians to rethink the doctrine of the person of Christ. While often criticized by orthodox theologians, his emphasis on the unity of Christ’s person and the centrality of **God-consciousness** remains a significant reference point in contemporary theology.
