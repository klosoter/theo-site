# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **communicatio idiomatum** within the broader context of **Christology** and the doctrine of the **incarnation**, emphasizing the unity of divine and human natures in the person of Christ. He argued that the communication of attributes is grounded in the eschatological self-revelation of God in Jesus, where the **history of Jesus** is the decisive locus of divine action and identity. For Pannenberg, the communicatio idiomatum is not merely a metaphysical assertion but is rooted in the historical and relational reality of Christ's person.

- "The unity of the person of Christ is constituted by the eschatological event of the resurrection, in which the divine and human natures are fully revealed in their mutual relation." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Key Works

- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (1991)
- Theology and the Kingdom of God (1969)
- Revelation as History (1961, with R. Rendtorff et al.)
- The Idea of God and Human Freedom (1973)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Revelation as the Basis for Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - The unity of Christ’s person is established in the historical event of the resurrection.
    - The communication of attributes is not abstract but grounded in the concrete history of Jesus.
    - Divine and human natures are revealed in their relation through historical acts.
    - The eschatological fulfillment in Christ is central to understanding the union of natures.
    - "The resurrection is the decisive event in which the unity of the divine and human is manifest." (Jesus—God and Man)

2. **Dynamic Unity of Christ’s Person**
    - Rejects static metaphysical accounts in favor of a relational, event-based unity.
    - The person of Christ is constituted through the ongoing self-revelation of God.
    - Communicatio idiomatum is possible because the divine Son actualizes his identity in history.
    - The unity is not a fusion of natures but a relational participation.
    - "The unity of Christ is not a substance but an event." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Eschatological Orientation of Christology**
    - Christ’s identity and the communication of attributes are oriented toward the future consummation.
    - The full significance of the communicatio idiomatum is realized eschatologically.
    - The resurrection anticipates the final revelation of Christ’s person.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is a proleptic reality, grounded in God’s future.
    - "The future of Jesus is the key to his identity as the God-man." (Jesus—God and Man)

4. **Rejection of Monophysitism and Nestorianism**
    - Affirms the distinction and unity of natures without confusion or separation.
    - The communicatio idiomatum safeguards the integrity of both divine and human in Christ.
    - Avoids reducing Christ to a mere human or a divine apparition.
    - Emphasizes the Chalcedonian Definition as a framework for understanding the union.
    - "The Chalcedonian formula remains indispensable for a proper understanding of Christ’s person." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Trinitarian Context of the Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - Christ’s person is understood within the dynamic relations of the Trinity.
    - The communication of attributes is possible because of the Son’s eternal relation to the Father and Spirit.
    - The incarnation is a Trinitarian event, not merely a Christological one.
    - The communicatio idiomatum reflects the self-giving of God in history.
    - "The incarnation is the act of the triune God, in which the Son assumes humanity for the sake of revelation and salvation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s treatment of the **communicatio idiomatum** has influenced contemporary discussions of **Christology** by rooting the doctrine in the historical and eschatological reality of Jesus. His emphasis on the event-character of Christ’s person challenged static metaphysical models and encouraged a more dynamic, relational approach. Pannenberg’s integration of history, eschatology, and Trinitarian theology continues to shape both academic and ecclesial understandings of the incarnation and the unity of Christ’s natures.
