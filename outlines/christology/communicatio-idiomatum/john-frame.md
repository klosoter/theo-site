# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **communicatio idiomatum** within the broader context of **Christology** and the **doctrine of the Trinity**, emphasizing the unity of Christ’s person while maintaining the distinction of his **divine and human natures**. He situates this doctrine within a **Reformed** framework, highlighting its importance for understanding the work of **redemption** and the coherence of biblical revelation.

- "The communicatio idiomatum is a necessary implication of the hypostatic union, for the person of Christ is both God and man." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ is one person with both a fully **divine** and fully **human nature**.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** arises from the union of these two natures in one person.
    - The properties of each nature are truly present and operative in Christ.
    - The unity of Christ’s person is foundational for all his mediatorial work.
    - "The hypostatic union is the basis for the communication of properties." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Rejection of Eutychianism and Nestorianism**
    - Frame insists on avoiding confusion or separation of the natures.
    - The **divine and human natures** remain distinct, not mixed or altered.
    - The person of Christ is not divided into two persons.
    - The communicatio idiomatum does not mean the natures themselves are exchanged.
    - "We must not confuse the natures, nor separate them." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Biblical Foundation for Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - Frame grounds the doctrine in scriptural passages that attribute divine and human properties to the one Christ.
    - He highlights texts such as Acts 20:28 and John 1:14.
    - The unity of Christ’s person is consistently affirmed in biblical revelation.
    - The doctrine safeguards the truth of the incarnation and atonement.
    - "Scripture attributes both divine and human qualities to the one person, Jesus." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Functional Significance for Redemption**
    - The communicatio idiomatum is essential for understanding Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - Only one who is both God and man can accomplish **atonement** and represent humanity.
    - The doctrine ensures the efficacy of Christ’s obedience and suffering.
    - It undergirds the believer’s confidence in the sufficiency of Christ’s work.
    - "The work of redemption depends on the unity of Christ’s person." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Integration with Trinitarian and Covenantal Theology**
    - Frame relates the communicatio idiomatum to the broader **Trinitarian** context.
    - He emphasizes the covenantal relationship between the Father and the incarnate Son.
    - The doctrine is seen as part of God’s self-revelation in history.
    - It is integrated into his **multiperspectival** approach to theology.
    - "The communicatio idiomatum fits within the broader framework of God’s covenantal dealings with his people." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s treatment of the **communicatio idiomatum** has reinforced its centrality in contemporary Reformed theology, particularly through his clear articulation of the doctrine’s biblical and systematic foundations. His work has influenced pastors, theologians, and students by integrating this classical doctrine with a robust **Trinitarian** and covenantal perspective. Frame’s multiperspectival method has provided fresh insight into the coherence and practical significance of Christological doctrines for the church today.
