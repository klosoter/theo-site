# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulates the **communicatio idiomatum** as a vital aspect of **Christology**, affirming the real union of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**. He upholds the classic **Reformed** understanding that the properties of each nature are truly communicated to the person, without confusion or separation, thus safeguarding both the integrity of Christ’s natures and the unity of his person.

- "The attributes of both natures are ascribed to the one person, but the natures themselves remain unconfused and distinct." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- The Wonderful Works of God
- Essays on Jesus Christ (in Bavinck Review)
- "The Doctrine of God" (sections on Christology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - Christ is one person in two natures, divine and human.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is possible because of the hypostatic union.
    - The person, not the natures, is the subject of all Christ’s actions and experiences.
    - The unity of personhood ensures that the attributes of both natures are truly predicated of Christ.
    - "The subject who acts and suffers is always the one person, the Son of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Distinction and Integrity of the Natures**
    - The divine and human natures remain unconfused and unmixed.
    - Each nature retains its own properties even in union.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** does not entail a transfer of properties between natures.
    - The distinction is essential to avoid both Nestorianism and Eutychianism.
    - "The properties of the natures are not transferred, but are attributed to the person." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Rejection of Lutheran Ubiquity**
    - Bavinck critiques the Lutheran view that Christ’s human nature shares in divine omnipresence.
    - He maintains that only the person, not the human nature, is omnipresent.
    - The Reformed position avoids confusion of the natures by denying ubiquity to Christ’s humanity.
    - This preserves the true humanity of Christ and the integrity of the incarnation.
    - "The Reformed, therefore, reject the ubiquity of Christ’s human nature." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Scriptural Foundation for Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - Bavinck grounds the doctrine in biblical passages attributing divine and human properties to Christ.
    - He highlights texts where Christ is described with attributes of both natures.
    - The doctrine is necessary to make sense of the biblical witness to Christ’s person and work.
    - Scripture itself predicates both suffering and glory to the one Christ.
    - "Scripture ascribes to the one Christ what belongs to both natures." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Soteriological Significance**
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is essential for understanding the efficacy of Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - Only one who is both God and man can truly redeem.
    - The unity of person ensures that Christ’s obedience and suffering have infinite value.
    - The doctrine safeguards the reality of both Christ’s atoning death and his divine power to save.
    - "Only he who is both God and man can be Mediator and Savior." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** has shaped modern Reformed **Christology**, providing a robust defense of the classic doctrine against both ancient and contemporary errors. His careful distinction between the natures and their properties, while maintaining the unity of Christ’s person, continues to influence theological scholarship and confessional formulations. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the mystery of the incarnation and the person of Christ.
