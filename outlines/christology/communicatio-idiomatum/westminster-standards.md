# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a classic **Reformed Christology** that affirms the doctrine of **communicatio idiomatum**—the communication of properties between the two natures of Christ—while carefully maintaining the distinction and integrity of the **divine and human natures** in the **one person** of the Mediator. The Standards uphold the **hypostatic union** as foundational, ensuring that the properties of each nature are ascribed to the person, not confused or transferred between natures.

- "Christ, in the work of mediation, acteth according to both natures, by each nature doing that which is proper to itself; yet, by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by the other nature." (Westminster Confession of Faith, 8.7)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 8 ("Of Christ the Mediator")
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 36–40
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 21–23
- The Westminster Assembly’s Minutes and Papers (for historical context)
- Robert Letham, The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Hypostatic Union Maintained**
   - Christ is one person with two distinct, unconfused natures: **divine** and **human**.
   - The union is personal (in the person), not essential (in the natures).
   - Each nature retains its own properties without mixture or change.
   - The **person** of Christ is the subject of all actions and experiences.
   - "Two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion." (WCF 8.2)

2. **Communication of Properties to the Person**
   - Properties of each nature are attributed to the **person** of Christ, not transferred between natures.
   - Scriptural statements about Christ may refer to either nature, but always to the one person.
   - This communication preserves the integrity of both natures.
   - The person acts according to both natures, each doing what is proper to itself.
   - "That which is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by the other nature." (WCF 8.7)

3. **Rejection of Eutychian and Nestorian Errors**
   - Denies any mixing or confusion of natures (Eutychianism).
   - Rejects any division of the person (Nestorianism).
   - Affirms the full reality and integrity of both natures in the one person.
   - The **mediatorial work** depends on this orthodox Christological framework.
   - "The two natures are without conversion, composition, or confusion." (WCF 8.2)

4. **Mediatorial Work Rooted in Both Natures**
   - Christ’s obedience and suffering are truly human, yet of infinite value due to the divine person.
   - The efficacy of redemption depends on the union of natures in the one Mediator.
   - The **communicatio idiomatum** allows for statements like "God purchased the church with his own blood."
   - The person of the Son acts through both natures in the work of salvation.
   - "The Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself...hath fully satisfied the justice of his Father." (WCF 8.5)

5. **Scriptural Basis for Communicatio Idiomatum**
   - The Standards ground their doctrine in biblical texts (e.g., Acts 20:28, John 1:14).
   - They interpret passages attributing divine actions to the man Jesus, and human experiences to God the Son, as examples of this communication.
   - The doctrine safeguards both the reality of the incarnation and the unity of the Redeemer.
   - The **Westminster Standards** see this as essential for a biblical and confessional understanding of Christ.
   - "The Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of one substance and equal with the Father, did...take upon him man’s nature." (WCF 8.2)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped **Reformed Christology**, providing a careful and precise articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** that guards against both ancient and modern Christological errors. Their balanced approach has influenced confessional documents and theological education in Presbyterian and Reformed traditions worldwide. By rooting their doctrine in Scripture and the ecumenical creeds, the Standards continue to serve as a benchmark for orthodox teaching on the person of Christ.
