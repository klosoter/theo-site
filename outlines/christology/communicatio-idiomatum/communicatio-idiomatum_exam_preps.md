### ESSAY
The doctrine of the **communicatio idiomatum**, the communication of properties, articulates how the one person of the incarnate Son is the subject of all the predicates of both natures without any transfer, mixture, or confusion of those natures. In more precise terms, it asserts that the properties and operations that are proper to the divine nature, and those that are proper to the human nature, can be truly predicated of the one person of Christ, yet never as if the divine nature became human or the human nature became divine. What is communicated is not the attributes themselves, but the right to predicate them of the one person. This apparently technical rule in fact governs worship of Christ, confession that God truly suffered and died in the flesh, and the coherence of atonement with **divine simplicity** and **impassibility**.

The decisive turning point of the tradition lies with Cyril of Alexandria and the Chalcedonian settlement that both appropriated and disciplined his insight. Cyril, in the context of the Nestorian controversy, perceived that the gospel itself demanded the confession that the one who was born of Mary is the eternal Son and that the one who was crucified is truly God. His preferred formula, “one nature of the Word incarnate,” from his second letter to Nestorius and subsequent writings, stressed the unity of the acting subject. For Cyril, the predicates of humility and suffering are truly those of the Word, because the Word has made the flesh his own. His polemical use of theopaschite language, “God suffered in the flesh,” was not a careless collapse of the Creator creature distinction but a deliberate safeguard of the unity of the person. This gives us the first key to the **communicatio idiomatum**: all Christological predications terminate in the person of the Logos.

Yet Cyril’s formulations raised anxieties about whether the integrity of the human nature was adequately secured. Antiochene critics feared that to say “one nature of the Word” endangered the full reality of Christ’s humanity and opened a path toward Eutychian or Monophysite collapse of the human into the divine. The Council of Chalcedon (451), drawing on Leo the Great as a second decisive figure, sought to preserve Cyril’s insight into personal unity while clarifying the duality of natures. Leo’s Tome provides a programmatic instance of **communicatio idiomatum** in nuce. He insists on one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only begotten, acknowledged in two natures, without confusion, change, division, or separation. The properties of each nature are preserved and come together in one person and subsistence. Hence Leo can say the same one is “remaining what he was and taking up what he was not,” and he speaks of the divine nature performing what is proper to it in communion with the human, and conversely the human performing what is proper to it in communion with the divine. The person acts according to either nature. That is precisely the metaphysical ground for saying that the Lord of glory was crucified, or that the Son of God hungers and sleeps.

The Chalcedonian pattern therefore yields the classic rule: predicates proper to either nature may be predicated of the person, and by further extension, predicates with a grammatical subject of one nature can be predicated of the person named according to the other. So “God suffered” is true but must be carefully specified as “God the Son suffered according to the human nature.” Orthodoxy refuses the Nestorian scruple that would refuse such speech for fear of attributing suffering to deity as deity, just as it rejects Eutychian collapse that would treat the divinity itself as altered by human limitations.

John of Damascus, as a third decisive figure, serves as the classical synthesizer of conciliar doctrine and helps crystallize the grammar that later scholastics and Reformers inherit. In his Exposition of the Orthodox Faith he insists that the union is hypostatic. There is no mixture or confusion of the natures, but a union in the one hypostasis of the Logos. Here the precise metaphysical distinction of nature, person, and hypostasis becomes a key tool for the **communicatio idiomatum**. Damascene can affirm, with Ambrose and earlier fathers, that “one of the Trinity suffered in the flesh,” while safeguarding that the divine nature remained impassible and immutable. The hypostasis is the common subject of both sets of properties, the locus where the predicates meet. Damascene explicitly articulates the rule that we may transfer the names from either nature to the person and, in a certain sense, across the natures, because the person who is named by either title is one and the same. Yet we must mentally discern in which nature the operation or property belongs. This is the classical Christological **analogy of attribution**: the predication is true of the person, but not univocally of both natures.

At this point a Westminster examiner might press: is this just semantic juggling, or does something real happen between the natures? The orthodox answer, elaborated especially by Reformed scholasticism, is that there is no real transfer of properties between the natures, but there is a real and ineffable personal union that grounds relational and representative predications. When we say “the man Jesus is omnipotent,” we speak truly because this man is the person of the Son who is omnipotent according to his divine nature. The human nature does not become omnipotent as such. The **communicatio idiomatum** is not a communication of essential attributes between essences, but of idioms to the hypostasis.

This patristic settlement already contains internal tensions. The Alexandrian insistence on personal unity inclines toward strong theopaschite and Marian predications, such as Theotokos, and risks obscuring the psychological integrity of Christ’s human soul and will. The Antiochene concern for the integrity of the human nature risks a functional dyarchy of subjects, one divine and one human. The communicatio functions as a control: if the communication is only moral or conjunctive, then the subject of the saving work is no longer unambiguously the eternal Son. Conversely, if the communication implies a physical mixture, the integrity of human obedience and sufferings is destroyed.

The Western medievals inherit this conciliar grammar and refine it in scholastic terms, but for the purpose of oral examination the pressure point comes with the Reformation debates, particularly between Martin Luther and John Calvin and their respective heirs. Luther, our fourth decisive figure, receives the patristic **communicatio idiomatum** but expands its application, especially in relation to the Lord’s Supper. Against Zwingli and others whom he perceives as Nestorianizing the Supper, Luther emphasizes that the human nature of Christ truly shares in, or at least is inseparably joined to, the divine attributes, especially omnipresence and life giving power. This stands behind his doctrine of the ubiquitous body of Christ. For Luther, because the person of the Son is omnipresent according to the divine nature, and because the human nature is personally united to the Son, the human nature is wherever the Son is. He thus speaks of a communication of majesty from the divine to the human.

Lutheran scholastics developed a threefold classification of **communicatio idiomatum**. First, a communication of idioms in concrete, where what is proper to one nature is predicated of the person, named with reference to the other nature. Second, a communication of majesty, where the human nature of Christ receives participation in certain divine perfections such as omnipresence. Third, a communication of operations, where operations of either nature are operations of the one person. The second category is the crux of the Lutheran Reformed dispute. Luther’s own instincts, driven by the Eucharistic controversy, wanted to be able to say that the body of Christ is truly present in, with, and under the elements everywhere they are celebrated. He reasoned that any denial of this threatened the unity of the person and the reality of feeding on the true body and blood.

Calvin, as a fifth decisive figure, sharply resists this extension. In the Institutes and polemical writings, Calvin insists on Chalcedon’s “without confusion” and the integrity of each nature’s essential properties. For Calvin and later Reformed scholastics such as Turretin, the **communicatio idiomatum** remains strictly a communication of idioms at the level of personal predication, not a real sharing of essential attributes between natures. To say the human nature becomes omnipresent is, in their judgment, either to make creaturely finitude vanish or to blur the Creator creature distinction in a way incompatible with **divine simplicity** and **immutability**. Calvin therefore presses the extra Calvinisticum: the eternal Son is not comprehended by the humanity he assumed but continues to exist and operate beyond, or extra, the flesh. This is not a Nestorian separation but a consequence of the infinite qualitative distinction between divine and human natures.

An examiner pressing the Reformed candidate might ask: does your denial of a communication of majesty imply that there is no real union, only an external relation? The answer must be an emphatic no. The Reformed affirm a true hypostatic union, such that the human nature has no independent personal subsistence and subsists only in the person of the Son. The union is ontological at the level of person, not accidental. Yet the natures remain really distinct in their essential properties. The person is the “suppositum” of both, and so we may predicate the idioms of either nature of the person, but we never collapse the natures. Hence a Reformed theologian can affirm with equal vigor that the Son of God died and that the divine nature did not die, by distinguishing the subject of the predicate from the mode according to which the predicate is true.

At this internal level, then, we have a key debate: Lutherans charge that the Reformed threaten to partition Christ by emphasizing the extra and denying a real communication of majesty. Reformed theologians respond that the Lutheran anthropology of Christ risks a quasi Eutychian deification of the humanity and blurs the line between God and creature. The Reformed also argue that the presence of Christ in the Supper is best explained Christologically by the Holy Spirit’s uniting us to the ascended humanity of Christ, who remains locally in heaven according to his human nature but is truly present to faith by the Spirit. The Supper debate is not a mere sacramental quarrel but a test case for how far one can extend **communicatio idiomatum** without violating Chalcedonian constraints.

Externally, the **communicatio idiomatum** stands as a boundary marker against several persistent Christological errors. Against Nestorianism and all modern functional dyarchies, it insists on the unity of the subject. To say “this man, Jesus, is God,” or “God died for us,” is not mere metaphor; it is theologically necessary for soteriology. A merely conjoined man and God cannot save, because the acts of the man would not be the acts of God. Against Eutychian and Monophysite tendencies, **communicatio idiomatum** blocks the idea that the divine nature is altered by assuming humanity or that the human nature is annihilated in deification. The very possibility of personal predication from both sides presupposes that there are, in fact, two intact sets of properties to predicate.

Modern kenotic Christologies transpose the issue. They propose that the Son, in becoming incarnate, divests himself of certain divine attributes such as omniscience or omnipresence to live a genuinely human life. This is often justified by appeal to Christ’s ignorance of the day and hour or his growth in wisdom. Here the orthodox use of **communicatio idiomatum** provides a clear response. Those texts are properly predicated of the human nature. The one who knows all things according to his divine nature truly does not know in his human cognitive experience according to his human nature. There is no need to posit a change in the divine nature. The moment one posits such change one has abandoned **divine immutability** and simplicity. The two sets of predicates can coexist because they belong to different natures united in one person. The failure to maintain this Christological grammar usually correlates with a collapse of classical theism.

Contemporary debates further stress test the doctrine with respect to impassibility and the atonement. To say “God suffers” has become in some circles a shibboleth of pastoral sensitivity and divine compassion. The classical doctrine, informed by **communicatio idiomatum**, insists that the subject who suffers is indeed God the Son, yet he suffers in and according to the assumed human nature. The divine nature remains impassible, not because God is apathetic, but because his mode of being is pure act. God does not undergo change in his being to suffer. The human nature, however, is constituted precisely to be capable of suffering. Because the subject of those human sufferings is the Son, this suffering is theandric, of infinite worth, truly the suffering of God in the flesh. Any attempt to make the divine essence itself passible in order to underwrite the reality of suffering tends to flatten the **communicatio idiomatum** into a material change in God rather than a personal union.

Examiner challenges here often take the form: if the divine nature does not suffer, are you not left with a merely human atonement, and how can that suffice for infinite guilt? The patristic and Reformed answer is that the value of the work is determined by the dignity of the person who performs it. Because the one who suffers and obeys is the person of the Son, the work has divine value, even though it is executed in the human nature. That is exactly what the **communicatio idiomatum** enables us to say: “God purchased the church with his own blood.” The blood is human, the subject divine. To demand that the divine essence itself bleed or suffer is to misconstrue both the transcendence of God and the logic of the incarnation.

The doctrine also has implications for worship and prayer. When believers worship Jesus, bow before the crucified and risen Lord, and sing to the Lamb who was slain, they are directing divine worship to a visible, tangible, human Lord. The **communicatio idiomatum** explains this without idolatry: the humanity is not worshiped for its own sake, as if a mere creature, but as personally united to the Son. The adoration terminates in the person, not in the nature considered abstractly. This undercuts any charge that Christian worship of the man Jesus violates the second commandment. Similarly, when we pray “Lord Jesus, have mercy,” we invoke the one who is simultaneously omnipotent and sympathetic, divine and human, precisely because the personal subject of both natures hears and answers.

The Christological grammar also guards adjacent loci such as **analogical knowledge** of God, the doctrine of **divine simplicity**, and the Creator creature distinction. If communication of idioms were turned into a univocal transfer of properties between natures, the structure of analogy would collapse. If the human nature literally became omniscient or omnipresent, we would have a created subject bearing divine attributes intrinsically, which would erode the uniqueness of the divine essence. The classical view maintains that all divine perfections remain rooted in and identical with the simple divine essence, and that the humanity, though uniquely graced and exalted, remains creaturely. The personal union is the only bridge.

Defending the classical Reformed reception of **communicatio idiomatum**, then, involves several critical affirmations. First, the communication is strictly at the level of hypostatic predication. The subject of all actions and properties is the one person of the Son. Second, the natures retain their essential properties without mixture or change. There is no real transfer or enhancement of human nature into deity. Third, the language of “God suffering,” “God dying,” or “God being born” is legitimate and necessary, provided we specify the mode “according to the human nature.” Fourth, any extension of the doctrine that implies a new real property in the divine nature, or the acquisition of divine properties by the human nature as such, must be rejected as inconsistent with Chalcedon and classical theism.

If an examiner were to challenge: but does this not leave your doctrine of the Supper thin, with Christ absent from the table? The Reformed answer, following Calvin, is no. The same **communicatio idiomatum** which teaches that we truly partake of Christ’s flesh and blood in the Supper does so by the Spirit’s uniting us to the whole Christ. Christ is locally present in heaven in his humanity, yet spiritually and really present to us on earth by the Spirit. The human nature remains finite and located, but the person of the Son, who is omnipresent according to his divine nature, is able truly, by the Spirit, to make his whole self present to the faith of communicants. Thus the Reformed do not undermine the unity of Christ’s person in the Supper; they preserve it without collapsing the natures.

Alternatively, the examiner may probe whether the Reformed view falls into a merely logical or “virtual” union. Here one must insist that the hypostatic union is not conceptual but ontological: the human nature has its very subsistence in the person of the Son. It never exists, even for an instant, as an independent human person. This underwriting of the human nature by the divine person is itself a real union, unique and unparalleled, yet it does not require any transfer of intrinsic properties across the natures. The metaphysical category of person or hypostasis is the key.

In conclusion, the doctrine of **communicatio idiomatum** functions as the Christological rule that allows the church to speak biblically robustly, liturgically reverently, and metaphysically coherently about the incarnate Lord. Cyril ensures that we never split Christ into two subjects. Leo and Chalcedon ensure that we never fuse the natures. John of Damascus bequeaths a metaphysical grammar of hypostasis and nature that makes the predications intelligible. Luther presses the unity toward a strong affirmation of Christ’s presence, while Calvin reins that pressure back within the Chalcedonian boundaries in order to preserve the transcendence and immutability of God and the integrity of Christ’s humanity. In siding with the classical and Reformed restriction of **communicatio idiomatum** to personal predication, one safeguards both the evangelical heart of confession that “God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself” and the classical theistic convictions about God’s simplicity, immutability, and impassibility that Westminster examiners will rightly demand.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Communicatio idiomatum** is the communication of properties such that what is proper to either nature may be truly predicated of the one person of Christ, without any real transfer or confusion of the natures themselves.
- Decisive figures: Cyril of Alexandria emphasized unity of person and theopaschite predication; Leo the Great and Chalcedon balanced personal unity with duality of natures; John of Damascus systematized hypostatic union and personal predication; Luther expanded the communication toward a communication of majesty; Calvin restricted it to personal predication, rejecting any real transfer of attributes between natures.
- Debates: Internal – Alexandrian versus Antiochene emphases, Lutheran versus Reformed on majesty and ubiquity, Eucharistic presence; External – Nestorian denial of full personal predication, Eutychian and Monophysite confusion of natures, kenotic Christologies altering the divine nature; Contemporary – divine impassibility, atonement value, worship of Christ, and the mode of Christ’s presence in the Supper and in the church.
- Defended position: Classical conciliar and Reformed view that **communicatio idiomatum** is a hypostatic communication of idioms, not an essential communication of attributes, thereby upholding real personal unity, full divinity and humanity, and classical theism.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - How can you say “God suffered” if God is impassible? Because the person who is God the Son truly suffered in and according to his human nature, so the subject is divine though the capacity to suffer is human.
  - Do you affirm a communication of majesty to Christ’s humanity? No, I affirm exaltation and unique grace to the humanity but deny any intrinsic acquisition of divine attributes by the human nature as such.
  - Does the extra Calvinisticum divide Christ into two persons? No, it asserts that the one person of the Son subsists and operates both within and beyond his assumed humanity according to distinct natures.
  - How does **communicatio idiomatum** relate to the value of the atonement? The atonement has infinite worth because the one who obeys and suffers is the divine person of the Son, even though the obedience and suffering occur in his human nature.
  - How is Christ really present in the Supper if his body is in heaven? By the Holy Spirit the whole Christ is truly communicated to faith, while his human nature remains locally in heaven and his divine nature is omnipresent, preserving both personal unity and natural distinction.
