# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **communicatio idiomatum** through the lens of his existential and demythologizing project, questioning the traditional metaphysical categories used in **Christology**. He emphasized the existential significance of the **incarnation** and the unity of the person of Christ, while remaining skeptical of classical formulations that treat the communication of attributes as ontological realities. For Bultmann, the importance of the doctrine lies in its proclamation of the **kerygma**, not in metaphysical speculation.

- "It is not the metaphysical structure of Christ’s person that is decisive, but the event of revelation in which God encounters man." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologizing Christological Formulations**
    - Seeks to reinterpret traditional doctrines, including communicatio idiomatum, in existential terms.
    - Rejects metaphysical speculation about the union of divine and human natures.
    - Focuses on the proclamation (kerygma) rather than ontological explanations.
    - Views the doctrine as a mythological expression of the encounter with God in Christ.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of the Incarnation**
    - Emphasizes the existential impact of Christ’s person for the believer.
    - The significance of Jesus is found in his role as the revealer, not in metaphysical attributes.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is meaningful only as it relates to faith and decision.
    - Downplays the importance of ontological categories in favor of existential encounter.
    - "What matters is not the metaphysical nature of Christ, but the fact that in him God encounters us." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - Affirms the unity of Christ’s person as essential for faith.
    - Rejects any division between the divine and human in Jesus.
    - The communication of attributes is a way of expressing the unity of revelation.
    - Christ is the locus of God’s self-disclosure, not a metaphysical puzzle.
    - "The unity of the person of Christ is not a problem of substance but of event." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Critique of Classical Metaphysics**
    - Challenges the adequacy of Chalcedonian and scholastic categories.
    - Argues that metaphysical language obscures the existential message of the New Testament.
    - Sees the communicatio idiomatum as a product of Hellenistic thought.
    - Calls for a reinterpretation of doctrine in light of modern existential philosophy.
    - "The dogma of the two natures is unintelligible to modern man." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is central, not metaphysical explanation.
    - The communicatio idiomatum serves the preaching of the gospel, not speculative theology.
    - Faith is response to the kerygma, not assent to metaphysical propositions.
    - The doctrine’s value is in its existential import for the believer.
    - "Faith is not assent to propositions, but decision in the face of the kerygma." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **communicatio idiomatum** challenged traditional Christological formulations and shifted the focus to existential interpretation and the proclamation of the **kerygma**. His demythologizing project influenced generations of New Testament scholars and theologians, prompting ongoing debate about the relevance of classical dogmatic categories. While often criticized by more orthodox traditions, Bultmann’s work remains a pivotal reference point in discussions of modern Christology and the interpretation of doctrinal language.
