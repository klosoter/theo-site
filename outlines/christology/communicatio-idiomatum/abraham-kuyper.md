# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper addressed the **communicatio idiomatum** within the framework of **Reformed orthodoxy** and the **doctrine of the two natures of Christ**. He upheld the classical Chalcedonian distinction, emphasizing the **personal union** of divine and human natures in Christ, and maintained a Reformed caution against any blurring of the distinction between the natures. Kuyper’s approach to the **communication of properties** was shaped by his desire to safeguard both the integrity of Christ’s humanity and the sovereignty of his divinity.

- "The union of the two natures in one Person does not result in a mingling of the natures, but in a communion of properties, each nature retaining its own attributes." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Strict Adherence to Chalcedonian Christology**
    - Upholds the **two natures** of Christ as "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation."
    - Rejects any **Eutychian** or **Nestorian** tendencies in the interpretation of the communicatio idiomatum.
    - Emphasizes the **personal union** as the locus for the communication of properties.
    - Insists that each nature retains its own essential attributes.
    "The two natures are united in one Person, but each nature remains distinct and unconfused." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Reformed Critique of Lutheran Ubiquitarianism**
    - Argues that the **human nature** of Christ does not become omnipresent through union with the divine.
    - Maintains that the **attributes of divinity** are not transferred to the humanity.
    - Sees the Lutheran view as a threat to the true humanity of Christ.
    - Affirms that the **communicatio idiomatum** is a communication of properties to the person, not between natures.
    "The Reformed have always opposed the idea that the human nature of Christ shares in the divine attribute of omnipresence." (E Voto Dordraceno)

3. **Communication Occurs at the Level of the Person**
    - The subject of the communication is the **person of the Son**, not the natures themselves.
    - Both divine and human predicates can be truly affirmed of the one person, Jesus Christ.
    - The properties of each nature are not transferred but are predicated of the person.
    - This safeguards the integrity of both natures while affirming the unity of the person.
    "It is the Person who acts, and in Him the divine and human are united, yet not confused." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

4. **Safeguarding the Integrity of Christ’s Humanity**
    - Christ’s human nature remains fully human, with all its limitations.
    - The **communication of properties** does not divinize the humanity.
    - The humanity of Christ is not omniscient, omnipotent, or omnipresent.
    - This ensures Christ’s true solidarity with humanity and his role as Mediator.
    "The human nature of Christ is not changed into the divine, nor does it lose its own characteristics." (E Voto Dordraceno)

5. **Theological Function of Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - Serves to explain how Christ can be the subject of both divine and human actions.
    - Supports the doctrine of **atonement** by affirming the unity of the acting subject.
    - Provides a framework for understanding the mystery of the **incarnation**.
    - Ensures that worship and faith are directed to the one person, Jesus Christ.
    "The communicatio idiomatum is necessary for the unity of Christ’s work and person." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** reinforced the classic **Reformed Christological** position, providing clarity and nuance in debates with Lutheran and modernist theologians. His careful distinction between the natures and his emphasis on the unity of the person influenced later Dutch Reformed theology and contributed to the preservation of orthodox Christology in the Neo-Calvinist tradition. Kuyper’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold the integrity of both the divine and human in the person of Christ.
