# Peter Lombard (c. 1100–1160)

Peter Lombard provided a foundational articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** within the context of **Christology** in his seminal work, the Sentences. He affirmed the unity of the **person of Christ** and explained how the **divine** and **human natures** could each be truly predicated of the one person, while maintaining the distinction of the two natures. Lombard’s approach shaped subsequent medieval and Reformed discussions of the **hypostatic union** and the proper attribution of properties to Christ.

- "Because of the unity of person, the properties of either nature are attributed to the one Christ." (Sentences, Book III, Distinction 6)

## Key Works

- Sentences (Libri Quattuor Sententiarum), especially Book III, Distinctions 5–7
- Peter Lombard: The Sentences, Book 3: On the Incarnation of the Word (English translation, relevant sections)
- Medieval commentaries on the Sentences (e.g., Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure)
- Scholarly studies: Philipp W. Rosemann, Peter Lombard (Great Medieval Thinkers)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Person**
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is grounded in the one **hypostasis** of the Word.
    - Both **divine** and **human** predicates are truly spoken of the one Christ.
    - The person, not the nature, is the subject of predication.
    - This unity avoids confusion or mingling of the two natures.
    - "It is not the nature, but the person, to whom the properties of both natures are attributed." (Sentences III.6.1)

2. **Distinction of Natures Maintained**
    - The **divine** and **human natures** remain distinct within the one person.
    - Each nature retains its own properties and operations.
    - The communication of idioms does not blend or alter the natures.
    - This distinction safeguards orthodox **Chalcedonian Christology**.
    - "The properties of the natures are not confused, but remain in their own integrity." (Sentences III.6.2)

3. **Predication According to Person**
    - Statements about Christ (e.g., "God suffered") are true by virtue of the person.
    - The subject of predication is always the person, not the nature alone.
    - This allows for true statements that cross the divine-human boundary.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is a logical consequence of the **incarnation**.
    - "Because of the unity of person, it is said that God was born, suffered, and died." (Sentences III.6.3)

4. **Scriptural Foundation**
    - Lombard grounds his doctrine in biblical texts (e.g., Acts 20:28, "God purchased with his own blood").
    - He interprets such passages as evidence of the legitimacy of the **communication of properties**.
    - Scripture’s language is not merely metaphorical but reflects ontological reality.
    - The doctrine is necessary to make sense of the biblical witness to Christ.
    - "Scripture attributes to God what belongs to the flesh, because of the unity of person." (Sentences III.6.4)

5. **Rejection of Heretical Alternatives**
    - Lombard rejects **Nestorianism** (which divides the person) and **Eutychianism** (which confuses the natures).
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is a safeguard against both errors.
    - The doctrine upholds the full reality of both natures in the one Christ.
    - It ensures the coherence of **redemption** accomplished by the God-man.
    - "If the properties of the natures were not communicated to the person, neither could salvation be accomplished." (Sentences III.6.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Peter Lombard’s formulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** in the Sentences became a standard reference for medieval and Reformation theologians. His careful distinction between **person** and **nature** shaped the scholastic tradition and provided a framework for later debates on the **hypostatic union**. Lombard’s influence is evident in the writings of Aquinas, Calvin, and the Reformed confessions, making his work a cornerstone for the ongoing development of orthodox Christology.
