# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a classic **Reformed Christology** that affirms the **communicatio idiomatum**—the communication of properties between Christ’s two natures—while upholding the **Chalcedonian distinction** between the divine and human natures. These confessions maintain the **personal union** of Christ’s natures, ensuring that the attributes of each nature are truly predicated of the one **Person of the Son**, without confusion or separation.

- "For since the divine and the human nature are so closely united in one person, it follows that the properties of each nature are ascribed to the person." (Heidelberg Catechism Q. 35)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 18–19
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 15, 17, 35, 48
- The Canons of Dort (1619), esp. Main Points II and III/IV
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.
- The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism by Lyle D. Bierma

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Personal Union of Two Natures**
   - Christ is one **Person** in whom the **divine** and **human natures** are inseparably united.
   - The union does not result in a mixture or confusion of natures.
   - Each nature retains its own distinct properties.
   - The union is essential for Christ’s mediatorial work.
   "We believe that by this conception the person of the Son is inseparably united and joined with the human nature." (Belgic Confession, Art. 19)

2. **Communication of Properties**
   - The attributes of both natures are truly predicated of the one Person.
   - The **communicatio idiomatum** is affirmed in a manner consistent with Chalcedonian orthodoxy.
   - The divine nature does not become human, nor does the human become divine.
   - The properties of each nature are not transferred but are ascribed to the Person.
   "Therefore we confess that He is very God and very man: very God by His power to conquer death, and very man that He might die for us according to the infirmity of His flesh." (Belgic Confession, Art. 19)

3. **Rejection of Eutychianism and Nestorianism**
   - The confessions explicitly reject any confusion or separation of natures.
   - Christ is not a mixture of God and man, nor two persons.
   - The unity is personal, not essential or accidental.
   - The integrity of both natures is preserved in the one Person.
   "These two natures are so closely united in one person that they were not separated even by His death." (Heidelberg Catechism Q. 48)

4. **Christ’s Mediatorial Work Depends on Both Natures**
   - Only one who is both God and man can be the Mediator.
   - The divine nature gives infinite value to Christ’s obedience and suffering.
   - The human nature enables Christ to represent humanity and to suffer.
   - The **communicatio idiomatum** grounds the efficacy of Christ’s atonement.
   "He must be true God, that by the power of His Godhead He might bear in His manhood the burden of God’s wrath." (Heidelberg Catechism Q. 17)

5. **Ascription of Actions to the Person**
   - Actions and experiences of either nature are ascribed to the one Person.
   - The confessions speak of God suffering and dying, but only according to the human nature.
   - The language of the confessions reflects the unity of the Person in all Christ does.
   - This ascription safeguards both the reality of the incarnation and the integrity of the natures.
   "We confess that by reason of this unity of the divine and human natures, the properties of each are given to the person." (Belgic Confession, Art. 19)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have provided a foundational articulation of **Reformed Christology**, shaping the doctrine of the **communicatio idiomatum** for generations of Reformed churches. Their careful balance of **Chalcedonian categories** and biblical fidelity has influenced confessional standards worldwide. By maintaining the unity of Christ’s Person and the distinction of His natures, these confessions continue to serve as a touchstone for orthodox teaching on the person and work of Christ.
