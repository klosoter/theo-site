# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a nuanced account of the **communicatio idiomatum** within the framework of **Chalcedonian Christology**. He affirmed the real union of **divine and human natures** in the one **Person of Christ**, allowing for the predication of properties from either nature to the person, while carefully distinguishing between the natures themselves.

- "Because of the unity of the person, it is correct to say that God is man, and that man is God." (Summa Theologiae III, q.16, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, Part III (esp. qq. 16–17)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book III
- De Veritate, q. 29
- Thomas Weinandy, Does God Suffer? (secondary, for analysis of Aquinas on communicatio idiomatum)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Person in Christ**
   - The **hypostatic union** joins two complete natures, divine and human, in one **person** (hypostasis).
   - All predicates of either nature can be truly affirmed of the one person of Christ.
   - The person, not the nature, is the subject of predication.
   - This unity grounds the legitimacy of the communicatio idiomatum.
   - "The union took place in the person, so that whatever belongs to either nature can be predicated of the person." (Summa Theologiae III, q.16, a.4)

2. **Distinction of Natures Maintained**
   - The **divine** and **human natures** remain unconfused and distinct after the union.
   - Properties of each nature are not transferred or mixed.
   - The communicatio idiomatum does not imply a change in the natures themselves.
   - Each nature retains its own proper operations and attributes.
   - "The properties of the divine and human natures remain distinct, though they belong to the same person." (Summa Theologiae III, q.16, a.1)

3. **Predication According to Suppositum**
   - Predication is made of the **suppositum** (the person), not directly of the nature.
   - Thus, statements like "God suffered" are true because the person who is God suffered in his human nature.
   - The communicatio idiomatum is a logical consequence of the hypostatic union.
   - This avoids Nestorian separation and Eutychian confusion.
   - "It is not the nature, but the person, who is the subject of predication." (Summa Theologiae III, q.16, a.2)

4. **Threefold Communication of Idioms**
   - Aquinas distinguishes three ways idioms are communicated: concrete terms, abstract terms, and relative terms.
   - Concrete terms (e.g., "Christ is God") are always true of the person.
   - Abstract terms (e.g., "divinity is humanity") are not interchangeable.
   - Relative terms (e.g., "the Son of God was born") require careful qualification.
   - "Concrete names of natures can be predicated of the person, but not abstract names." (Summa Theologiae III, q.16, a.8)

5. **Soteriological Significance**
   - The communicatio idiomatum undergirds the reality of the **Incarnation** and **atonement**.
   - It ensures that the acts of Christ, including suffering and death, are truly acts of the divine person.
   - This affirms the efficacy of Christ's work for human salvation.
   - The doctrine safeguards the reality of both Christ’s divinity and humanity in redemption.
   - "It was necessary for our salvation that the same person who is God should also be man." (Summa Theologiae III, q.1, a.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** became foundational for later Western Christology, influencing both Roman Catholic and Protestant scholasticism. His careful distinctions between **person** and **nature** provided a framework for orthodox reflection on the Incarnation and safeguarded against heretical tendencies. The clarity and precision of his account continue to shape contemporary discussions on the unity and distinction in the person of Christ.
