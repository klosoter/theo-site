# Cyril of Alexandria (c. 376–444)

Cyril of Alexandria was a central figure in shaping the doctrine of **communicatio idiomatum**, emphasizing the unity of Christ’s **divine and human natures** in the one **Person** (hypostasis) of the Word. He argued that the properties of both **natures** are truly predicated of the one Christ, thereby safeguarding the reality of the **Incarnation** and the efficacy of **redemption**.

- "We do not say that the nature of the Word was changed into flesh, but that the Word, having united to Himself flesh endowed with a rational soul, became man in an ineffable and incomprehensible manner." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

## Key Works

- Scholia on the Incarnation of the Only-Begotten

- Commentary on John
- Letters to Succensus

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Person**
    - Christ is one **Person** (hypostasis), not two, after the **Incarnation**.
    - The divine and human natures are united without confusion or division.
    - The union is real and ontological, not merely moral or external.
    - This unity grounds the possibility of the **communicatio idiomatum**.
    "For there is one Son and not two, even though He is conceived as having both the divine and the human." (On the Unity of Christ)

2. **Distinction without Separation of Natures**
    - The divine and human natures remain distinct within the one Person.
    - Each nature retains its own properties and operations.
    - The distinction is maintained to avoid **Eutychianism** and **Nestorianism**.
    - The communicatio idiomatum does not entail a mixing or confusion of natures.
    "We do not divide the natures, but confess one Christ, the Son and Lord." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

3. **Predication of Properties**
    - The attributes of both natures can be truly predicated of the one Person.
    - It is proper to say "God suffered" or "the Word was crucified" because of the hypostatic union.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is grounded in the unity of subject, not a change in natures.
    - This predication is essential for the reality of **salvation**.
    "The Word Himself, being impassible, is said to have suffered in the flesh." (Scholia on the Incarnation)

4. **Soteriological Significance**
    - The communicatio idiomatum is necessary for the efficacy of **redemption**.
    - Only if the Word truly assumes humanity can He heal and save it.
    - The union ensures that Christ’s actions and sufferings are those of the divine Son.
    - This undergirds the reality of the atonement and the deification of humanity.
    "He who is by nature God became man, and did not disdain the economy of the flesh, that He might save those who are in the flesh." (On the Unity of Christ)

5. **Scriptural Foundation**
    - Cyril grounds his doctrine in the language of **Scripture**, especially the Gospels and Pauline epistles.
    - He interprets biblical passages that attribute human experiences to the divine Word as evidence of the communicatio idiomatum.
    - Scriptural Christology is read through the lens of the hypostatic union.
    - The biblical witness is decisive for doctrinal formulation.
    "For the Word was made flesh, not by the conversion of the Word into flesh, but by the assumption of the flesh to Himself." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

## Legacy and Impact

Cyril’s articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** became foundational for later **Christological** developments, especially at the **Council of Chalcedon**. His insistence on the unity of Christ’s Person while maintaining the distinction of natures shaped the orthodox understanding of the Incarnation. The language and logic of his doctrine continue to inform Reformed and ecumenical discussions of the person and work of Christ. Cyril’s influence endures in the ongoing affirmation of the true divinity and true humanity of the one Lord Jesus Christ.
