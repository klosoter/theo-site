# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield addressed the **communicatio idiomatum** within the context of **Christology**, emphasizing the unity of the **person of Christ** while maintaining the distinction between His **divine and human natures**. Warfield upheld the **Chalcedonian Definition**, insisting that the properties of each nature are truly predicated of the one person, yet without confusion or mixture.

- "The attributes of both the divine and the human natures belong to the one person of Christ, and are predicated of Him as such." ("The Person of Christ," in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Person of Christ" (in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 2)
- "The Emotional Life of Our Lord"
- "The Divine and Human in the Saviour's Life" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Humanity and Divinity of Christ" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Two Natures of Christ" (in Selected Shorter Writings)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Personal Union**
    - Christ is a single **person** possessing both a **divine** and a **human nature**.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is grounded in the unity of Christ’s person, not in a fusion of natures.
    - The person, not the nature, is the subject of all predicates.
    - Warfield insists on the **hypostatic union** as the basis for attributing the properties of both natures to Christ.
    - "It is the person who acts, and the natures supply the capacities for action." ("The Person of Christ")

2. **Distinction Without Separation of Natures**
    - The divine and human natures remain **distinct** and unconfused in the one person.
    - The properties of each nature are not transferred or mixed.
    - Warfield rejects any Eutychian or Nestorian tendencies.
    - The communicatio idiomatum does not entail a change in the natures themselves.
    - "The natures are united in the person, but not confused in the union." ("The Person of Christ")

3. **Predication of Attributes to the Person**
    - Attributes of both natures can be truly predicated of the one person of Christ.
    - Warfield affirms that Christ can be called both **God** and **man** without contradiction.
    - The predication is always personal, not natural.
    - Scriptural language supports this dual predication (e.g., "the Lord of glory was crucified").
    - "Whatever may be said of either nature may be said of the one person." ("The Person of Christ")

4. **Functional Integrity of Each Nature**
    - Each nature retains its own **integrity** and functions according to its properties.
    - The divine nature does not become human, nor does the human become divine.
    - Christ’s actions are performed according to either nature, but always by the one person.
    - The communicatio idiomatum does not imply the transfer of properties, but their personal attribution.
    - "The divine does not become human, nor the human divine, but both subsist in the one person." ("The Person of Christ")

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Communicatio Idiomatum**
    - Warfield grounds his doctrine in the **biblical witness** to Christ’s person and work.
    - He appeals to passages where divine and human attributes are predicated of Christ.
    - The New Testament presents Christ as acting and suffering in both natures.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is necessary for a coherent biblical **Christology**.
    - "The Scriptures themselves teach us to attribute to Christ all that is true of either nature." ("The Person of Christ")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum** has shaped Reformed and evangelical approaches to **Christology**, reinforcing the importance of the **hypostatic union**. His careful distinctions helped safeguard orthodox doctrine against both **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors. Warfield’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of the person and work of Christ, especially regarding the unity and distinction of Christ’s natures. His work remains a standard reference for those defending classical **Reformed Christology**.
