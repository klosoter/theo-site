# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til interpreted the **delay of the Parousia** through the framework of **Reformed eschatology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He argued that the apparent delay is not a theological problem but a demonstration of the **sovereignty of God** and the unfolding of **covenantal revelation** in redemptive history. For Van Til, the delay ultimately affirms the consistency and reliability of **Scripture**.

- "The delay of the Parousia is itself part of the plan of God, serving to display both his patience and his faithfulness to his covenant promises." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sovereignty of God in Redemptive History**
    - God ordains the timing of all events, including the Parousia.
    - The delay is purposeful within God's eternal decree.
    - Human history unfolds according to the divine plan, not autonomous human expectation.
    - The delay magnifies God's patience and mercy toward the elect.
    "God’s counsel alone determines the course of history, including the return of Christ." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenantal Revelation and Consistency**
    - The promises of Christ’s return are rooted in the covenantal structure of Scripture.
    - The delay confirms, rather than undermines, the reliability of God’s Word.
    - Redemptive history unfolds progressively, revealing more of God’s purposes.
    - The covenantal context explains the patience and apparent delay in fulfillment.
    "The covenant God is always faithful to his promises, even when their fulfillment seems delayed." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Presuppositional Apologetics and the Problem of Delay**
    - Unbelieving critiques of the delay rest on autonomous reasoning.
    - Only the Christian worldview provides the proper context for understanding the Parousia.
    - The delay is problematic only if one rejects the presuppositions of biblical revelation.
    - Apologetics must expose the antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought on eschatology.
    "It is only on the basis of the Christian presupposition that the delay of Christ’s coming has meaning." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Scripture’s Authority and Self-Attestation**
    - Scripture interprets its own teaching on the timing of the Parousia.
    - The authority of Scripture is not diminished by the delay.
    - Apparent difficulties are resolved within the self-attesting nature of the Bible.
    - The delay highlights the need for submission to biblical revelation over human speculation.
    "The Scriptures are self-attesting and must be accepted on their own authority, even regarding the Parousia." (The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture)

5. **Eschatological Hope and Christian Living**
    - The delay of the Parousia calls believers to perseverance and faithfulness.
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in the certainty of God’s promises, not in human timetables.
    - The church’s mission continues during the period of delay, empowered by the Spirit.
    - The delay is an opportunity for the ingathering of the elect and the display of God’s grace.
    "The Christian’s hope is not diminished by delay but strengthened by the assurance of God’s sovereign purpose." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **delay of the Parousia** reinforced the Reformed emphasis on the **sovereignty of God** and the reliability of Scripture. His presuppositional method shaped generations of Reformed apologists to address eschatological questions from within a robustly biblical worldview. Van Til’s integration of **covenantal theology** and apologetics continues to influence contemporary Reformed thought on the significance of the Parousia’s timing.
