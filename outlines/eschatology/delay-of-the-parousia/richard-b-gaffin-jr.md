# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. interprets the **delay of the Parousia** within the framework of **redemptive history**, emphasizing the inaugurated yet not consummated nature of **eschatology**. He argues that the **resurrection of Christ** marks the beginning of the end times, but the full realization of the **kingdom of God** awaits Christ’s return, explaining the apparent delay as intrinsic to the church’s present age.

- "The period between Christ’s resurrection and return is not a parenthesis but the era of the Spirit, integral to the fulfillment of God’s eschatological purposes." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "The Eschatology of the New Testament Church" (in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology is Already/Not Yet**
    - The **resurrection of Christ** inaugurates the last days, but their consummation is future.
    - The church lives in the tension between the **already** of salvation accomplished and the **not yet** of salvation consummated.
    - The delay of the Parousia is not a failure but a necessary phase in **redemptive history**.
    - This framework shapes the Christian’s understanding of history and hope.
    - "The New Testament church is an eschatological community, living between the times." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **The Spirit’s Role in the Interim**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is poured out as the down payment of the age to come.
    - The Spirit’s presence assures believers of their future inheritance during the delay.
    - The gifts and ministry of the Spirit are signs of the inaugurated kingdom.
    - The Spirit sustains the church’s mission until the Parousia.
    - "The Spirit is the eschatological gift, the guarantee of the not yet." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

3. **Christ’s Resurrection as Eschatological Turning Point**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the firstfruits of the general resurrection.
    - The delay is not a gap but the outworking of resurrection power in history.
    - Believers participate in resurrection life now, awaiting its fullness.
    - The Parousia will consummate what began in Christ’s resurrection.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the end, not the end itself." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Mission and Suffering in the Present Age**
    - The church’s mission unfolds in the context of the delay.
    - Suffering and opposition are expected until Christ returns.
    - The delay provides opportunity for the gospel to reach the nations.
    - The church’s endurance is grounded in eschatological hope.
    - "The interim is marked by suffering as well as by the spread of the gospel." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Theological Coherence of the Delay**
    - The delay is not accidental but divinely purposed within **God’s plan**.
    - It allows for the full gathering of the elect and the maturation of the church.
    - The New Testament anticipates and explains the delay, not as a problem but as a stage in fulfillment.
    - The coherence of the delay is rooted in the unity of **redemptive history**.
    - "The so-called delay of the Parousia is integral, not incidental, to the outworking of God’s eschatological purposes." ("The Eschatology of the New Testament Church")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **already/not yet** structure of eschatology has profoundly shaped Reformed and evangelical understandings of the delay of the Parousia. His emphasis on the **resurrection of Christ** as the turning point in redemptive history has influenced both academic theology and pastoral ministry. Gaffin’s work continues to provide a robust biblical-theological framework for interpreting the church’s present age and its hope for Christ’s return.
