# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards address the **delay of the Parousia** within the broader framework of **eschatology**, emphasizing the certainty of Christ’s return while affirming the inscrutability of its timing. They stress the necessity of **watchfulness**, the unfolding of **God’s redemptive plan**, and the importance of **gospel proclamation** before the end. The Standards maintain that the apparent delay serves to display God’s **patience** and to gather the full number of the **elect**.

- "As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin, and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity; so will He have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be always watchful." (Westminster Confession of Faith 33.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Q&A 37–38)

## Legacy and Impact

Their emphasis on **watchfulness**, gospel proclamation, and the certainty of Christ’s return continues to inform confessional churches and theological education. By situating the delay within God’s sovereign and redemptive purposes, the Standards offer enduring resources for pastoral ministry and Christian hope.
