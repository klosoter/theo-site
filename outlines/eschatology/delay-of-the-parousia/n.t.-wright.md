# N.T. Wright (1948–)

N.T. Wright approaches the **delay of the Parousia** by re-examining traditional eschatological frameworks, arguing that much New Testament language about the "coming" of Jesus refers to the **vindication of Jesus and the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70**, rather than a postponed end of history. He contends that the **Kingdom of God** was inaugurated in Christ’s ministry and resurrection, and that the early church’s expectation was not mistaken but misunderstood by later interpreters.

- "When Jesus spoke of the coming of the Son of Man, he was referring not to the end of the world but to events within a generation, above all the destruction of Jerusalem." (Jesus and the Victory of God)

## Key Works

- Jesus and the Victory of God (1996)
- The Resurrection of the Son of God (2003)
- Surprised by Hope (2007)
- Paul and the Faithfulness of God (2013)
- The New Testament and the People of God (1992)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Reframing the Parousia in Historical Context**
    - Argues that much New Testament **eschatological** language refers to the events of AD 70.
    - Sees the "coming" of the Son of Man as **vindication** rather than a physical return.
    - Emphasizes the importance of **Second Temple Jewish expectations** for interpreting Jesus’ words.
    - Suggests that the early church did not expect a simple, imminent end of the world.
    - "The language of imminent expectation is not about the collapse of the space-time universe but about events within history." (Jesus and the Victory of God)

2. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
    - Asserts that the **Kingdom of God** was inaugurated in Jesus’ ministry, death, and resurrection.
    - The "delay" is a misunderstanding; the **new age** has already begun.
    - The church lives in the tension of the "already" and "not yet."
    - The final consummation remains future, but the decisive victory has occurred.
    - "God’s future has already broken into the present in Jesus." (Surprised by Hope)

3. **Critique of Traditional Apocalyptic Readings**
    - Challenges readings that see Jesus as predicting an imminent end to the cosmos.
    - Argues that **apocalyptic imagery** is symbolic of God’s judgment on Israel.
    - Maintains that Jesus’ predictions were fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem.
    - Sees misunderstanding of genre as a source of confusion about the Parousia.
    - "Jesus’ language about the sun and moon darkening is drawn from Old Testament imagery of judgment." (Jesus and the Victory of God)

4. **Resurrection as Central Eschatological Event**
    - The **bodily resurrection** of Jesus is the turning point of history.
    - Resurrection inaugurates the new creation and affirms the goodness of the material world.
    - The hope of the church is not escape but **renewal of creation**.
    - The Parousia is the completion of what began at Easter.
    - "The resurrection is not about life after death, but about life after life after death." (Surprised by Hope)

5. **Mission of the Church in the Present Age**
    - The church is called to embody the **Kingdom of God** in the present.
    - Christian mission is rooted in the reality of the inaugurated Kingdom.
    - The delay is not a problem but an opportunity for **witness and transformation**.
    - The church anticipates the final return by living out resurrection life now.
    - "The church is to be for the world what Jesus was for Israel." (Surprised by Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

N.T. Wright’s reinterpretation of the **delay of the Parousia** has significantly influenced contemporary discussions of **eschatology** and the historical Jesus. By situating New Testament expectations within the context of **Second Temple Judaism**, he has challenged both skeptical and traditionalist readings. His work has encouraged a renewed focus on the **Kingdom of God** as a present reality and shaped how scholars and pastors understand the church’s mission in the world. Wright’s approach continues to provoke debate and inspire further research on the meaning of Jesus’ eschatological teaching.
