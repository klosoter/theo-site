# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine addressed the **delay of the Parousia** within his broader eschatological framework, emphasizing the mysterious nature of God's timing and the necessity of perseverance in the **present age**. He interpreted the postponement of Christ's return as a period for the **growth of the Church**, the spread of the **gospel**, and the testing of the faithful, all under the sovereign providence of God. Augustine cautioned against speculative calculations, urging believers to focus on **faithful living** rather than predicting the end.

- "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power." (City of God, XX.5)

## Key Works

- City of God (De Civitate Dei), especially Books XX–XXII
- Expositions on the Psalms
- Sermons (various, especially on eschatological texts)
- Letters (notably Epistle 199 to Hesychius)
- On the Trinity (De Trinitate)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty over Eschatological Timing**
    - The timing of the **Parousia** is known only to God and is not subject to human calculation.
    - Augustine insists that all history unfolds according to **divine providence**.
    - The delay serves God's purposes in the redemption and sanctification of the elect.
    - Human impatience or speculation reflects a lack of trust in God's wisdom.
    - "The Lord Himself says, 'It is not for you to know the times or the seasons.'" (City of God, XX.5)

2. **Purpose of the Delay: Growth of the Church**
    - The postponement allows for the **gathering of the elect** from all nations.
    - Augustine sees the Church’s expansion as a fulfillment of prophecy during the interim.
    - The delay is a period for the **preaching of the gospel** and repentance.
    - It provides time for the wheat and tares to grow together until the final judgment.
    - "The reason for the delay is that the full number of the saints may be gathered in." (City of God, XX.8)

3. **Warning Against Eschatological Speculation**
    - Augustine strongly opposes attempts to calculate the date of Christ’s return.
    - He interprets biblical warnings as a call to humility and vigilance.
    - Speculation distracts from the call to **holy living** and readiness.
    - The Church is to live in constant expectation, not in anxiety over timing.
    - "Let us not fix the time, which He has hidden from us." (City of God, XX.30)

4. **Present Age as a Time of Testing and Perseverance**
    - The delay exposes the faith and perseverance of believers amid trials.
    - Augustine views the present as a period of spiritual warfare between the **City of God** and the **earthly city**.
    - Suffering and tribulation are integral to the Church’s pilgrimage.
    - The faithful are called to endure, trusting in the ultimate fulfillment of God’s promises.
    - "This life is a time of patience, not of glory." (City of God, XIX.10)

5. **Christ’s Return as Certain and Sudden**
    - Despite the delay, the **Parousia** is assured and will come unexpectedly.
    - Augustine emphasizes the need for constant readiness and moral vigilance.
    - The suddenness of Christ’s return is a recurring theme in his preaching.
    - The certainty of judgment motivates ethical conduct and hope.
    - "He will come, but we know not when; let us be always ready." (Sermon 93)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s interpretation of the **delay of the Parousia** shaped Western Christian eschatology, discouraging speculative millenarianism and emphasizing the Church’s mission in the present age. His focus on **divine providence** and the spiritual significance of the interim period influenced both medieval and Reformation thought. Augustine’s approach continues to inform contemporary discussions on eschatological expectation, patience, and the nature of Christian hope.
