# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—address the **delay of the Parousia** within the broader framework of **eschatology**. They affirm the certainty of **Christ’s return** while emphasizing the necessity of patient expectation and the ongoing work of the **church** in the present age. The confessions maintain that the apparent delay serves God’s redemptive purposes and underscores the call to **perseverance** and **watchfulness**.

- "We must always be prepared for the return of Christ, though we do not know the day or the hour." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 52)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Articles 37 ("The Last Judgment")
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Day 19 (Q&A 52)
- Canons of Dort, Fifth Head of Doctrine (Perseverance of the Saints)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- The Reformation Study Bible (notes on the Three Forms of Unity and eschatology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Certainty of Christ’s Return**
   - Affirms the **visible, bodily return** of Christ as a foundational article of faith.
   - The timing is unknown and not for believers to calculate.
   - The delay does not diminish the certainty or imminence of the event.
   - The church is called to live in hope and readiness.
   - "We believe, according to the Word of God, that when the time appointed by the Lord is come... our Lord Jesus Christ will come from heaven." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

2. **Purposeful Delay**
   - The delay of the Parousia is attributed to God’s sovereign plan.
   - It allows for the **gathering of the elect** from all nations.
   - The delay is a demonstration of God’s patience and mercy.
   - It provides opportunity for repentance and faith.
   - "The Lord does not delay his promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance." (cf. 2 Peter 3:9, reflected in Canons of Dort I.3)

3. **Call to Perseverance**
   - Believers are exhorted to **persevere in faith** amid suffering and temptation.
   - The delay tests and refines the faith of the church.
   - Assurance of final victory is grounded in Christ’s intercession.
   - The sacraments and preaching sustain hope during the interim.
   - "In all my sorrow and persecution, I lift up my head and eagerly await... Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 52)

4. **Watchfulness and Readiness**
   - Christians are to remain spiritually vigilant and morally upright.
   - The unknown timing of the Parousia motivates continual readiness.
   - The confessions warn against complacency and false security.
   - The church is to encourage one another as the day approaches.
   - "We must always be prepared for the return of Christ, though we do not know the day or the hour." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 52)

5. **Eschatological Hope and Comfort**
   - The delay is not cause for despair but for hope in God’s promises.
   - The final judgment will vindicate the righteous and renew creation.
   - The confessions stress the **comfort** believers have in Christ’s return.
   - The hope of the Parousia shapes Christian life and worship.
   - "This is our comfort, that Christ will come as judge from heaven." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed understandings of the **delay of the Parousia**, emphasizing both the certainty and the purposefulness of Christ’s return. Their balanced approach—combining assurance, patience, and ethical exhortation—continues to inform Reformed preaching, catechesis, and pastoral care. By rooting eschatological hope in God’s sovereignty and faithfulness, these confessions have provided enduring comfort and direction for generations of believers awaiting the consummation of all things.
