# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray addressed the **delay of the Parousia** within the framework of **Reformed eschatology**, emphasizing the sovereignty of God over redemptive history and the certainty of Christ’s return. He argued that the apparent delay is not a failure of promise but a manifestation of **divine patience** and the outworking of God’s **redemptive purpose** in history.

- "The apparent delay is not a postponement but the interval determined by the counsel of God for the accomplishment of his saving purpose." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT, especially commentary on Romans 11 and 13)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "The Advent Hope" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "The Immediacy of the Parousia" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1960)
- "The Epistle of James" (NICNT, relevant for discussion of eschatological patience)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Certainty of Christ’s Return**
    - The **Parousia** is a definite, future event grounded in the promises of Scripture.
    - The delay does not undermine the certainty or imminence of Christ’s return.
    - God’s faithfulness guarantees the fulfillment of eschatological hope.
    - The church is called to live in expectation, not speculation.
    - "The certainty of the event is not diminished by the uncertainty of the time." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Divine Sovereignty Over Redemptive History**
    - The timing of the Parousia is determined by God’s sovereign will.
    - Human perceptions of delay are subordinate to God’s eternal counsel.
    - The interval serves the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan.
    - The church’s mission is framed by God’s timetable, not human calculation.
    - "The apparent delay is the interval fixed by God for the accomplishment of his saving purpose." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Purpose of the Delay: Salvation of the Elect**
    - The delay allows for the gathering in of all the elect.
    - God’s patience is directed toward the full realization of redemption.
    - The interval is a period of gospel proclamation and repentance.
    - The church’s evangelistic mandate is rooted in this redemptive patience.
    - "The longsuffering of God is salvation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Imminence and Watchfulness**
    - The New Testament teaches the **imminence** of Christ’s return, not its immediacy.
    - Believers are exhorted to constant readiness and vigilance.
    - Imminence fosters ethical living and perseverance.
    - The delay tests and refines the faith of the church.
    - "Imminence means that the event may occur at any time, not that it must occur immediately." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Interpretation of Eschatological Passages**
    - Eschatological texts must be read in light of the whole counsel of God.
    - Apparent references to an immediate Parousia are to be understood theologically, not chronologically.
    - The language of nearness serves to intensify hope and ethical urgency.
    - The delay is not a contradiction but a mystery of God’s providence.
    - "The nearness of the Parousia is ethical and redemptive, not chronological." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s treatment of the **delay of the Parousia** has shaped Reformed eschatological thought by emphasizing the harmony of **divine sovereignty** and human responsibility in the unfolding of redemptive history. His careful exegesis and theological clarity have influenced generations of pastors and scholars, particularly within the Westminster tradition. Murray’s insistence on the certainty of Christ’s return, despite the apparent delay, continues to inform contemporary discussions on eschatological hope and the mission of the church.
