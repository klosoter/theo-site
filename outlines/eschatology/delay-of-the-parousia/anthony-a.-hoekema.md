# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema addressed the **delay of the Parousia** within the framework of **Reformed eschatology**, emphasizing the already/not yet tension of the **kingdom of God**. He argued that the apparent postponement of Christ’s return is not a failure of divine promise but a reflection of God’s redemptive purpose and patience, allowing for the full ingathering of the elect and the completion of the church’s mission.

- "The delay of Christ’s return is not a postponement of God’s plan, but an integral part of it." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Key Works

- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- "Eschatology" in The Encyclopedia of Christianity
- "The Reformed Perspective" in The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views
- Created in God’s Image (1986) [for broader theological context]

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Already/Not Yet Structure of the Kingdom**
    - The **kingdom of God** is both a present reality and a future hope.
    - The delay of the Parousia highlights the ongoing fulfillment of redemptive history.
    - Believers live in the tension between inaugurated and consummated eschatology.
    - This framework explains why the Parousia has not yet occurred.
    - "The kingdom is present, but not yet fully realized." ("The Bible and the Future")

2. **Purposeful Divine Delay**
    - The delay is intentional, serving God’s redemptive plan.
    - It allows time for the gospel to be preached to all nations.
    - God’s patience is an expression of His mercy toward the elect.
    - The delay is not a result of human failure or unforeseen circumstances.
    - "God’s apparent delay is a manifestation of his patience, not of his forgetfulness." ("The Bible and the Future")

3. **Certainty of Christ’s Return**
    - The Parousia remains a certain and future event.
    - The delay does not undermine the reliability of God’s promises.
    - Believers are called to live in expectancy and readiness.
    - The timing is hidden within God’s sovereign will.
    - "The fact that Christ has not yet returned does not mean he will not return." ("The Bible and the Future")

4. **Mission of the Church During the Delay**
    - The church’s mission continues until Christ returns.
    - Evangelism and discipleship are essential in the interim period.
    - The delay provides opportunity for the church’s witness and growth.
    - The church is to live in holiness and hope, anticipating the Parousia.
    - "The church must continue its task until the Lord comes." ("The Bible and the Future")

5. **Interpretation of New Testament Expectation**
    - New Testament writers express an imminent expectation, but not a fixed timetable.
    - The language of imminence is pastoral, urging vigilance and faithfulness.
    - Early Christians understood the possibility of delay within God’s plan.
    - The delay is consistent with apostolic teaching and eschatological hope.
    - "The New Testament does not teach that Christ must return within a generation, but that he may return at any time." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of the **delay of the Parousia** has shaped modern Reformed eschatology, providing a robust theological rationale for the ongoing expectation of Christ’s return. His emphasis on the already/not yet dynamic and the purposeful nature of the delay has influenced evangelical discussions of eschatological hope and mission. Hoekema’s work continues to serve as a standard reference for understanding the relationship between the present age and the consummation of all things in Christ.
