# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin addressed the **delay of the Parousia** within the broader framework of **Reformed eschatology**, emphasizing the sovereignty of God over the timing of **Christ’s return**. He maintained that the apparent postponement serves the purposes of **divine patience** and the ongoing call to **repentance**, while warning against speculative attempts to determine the exact time of the **Second Coming**.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty Over the Parousia**
    - The timing of **Christ’s return** is known only to God.
    - Human speculation about the date is both futile and presumptuous.
    - The delay serves God’s redemptive purposes in history.
    - Believers are called to trust in God’s providence regarding the end.
    - "Let us not be so rash as to inquire into things which the Lord has been pleased to conceal from us." (Institutes 3.25.4)

2. **Purposeful Delay: Divine Patience and Repentance**
    - The delay is an expression of God’s **patience** toward sinners.
    - It allows time for the **gospel** to be proclaimed to all nations.
    - The postponement is a call to ongoing **repentance** and faith.
    - This period is not arbitrary but is filled with divine intention.
    - "The Lord delays because he is unwilling that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance." (Commentary on 2 Peter 3:9)

3. **Warning Against Eschatological Speculation**
    - Calvin strongly opposes date-setting for the **Second Coming**.
    - He sees such speculation as a distraction from faithful living.
    - The focus should be on readiness, not prediction.
    - The church is warned against being led astray by false teachers.
    - "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power." (Commentary on Acts 1:7)

4. **Eschatological Watchfulness and Readiness**
    - The delay calls believers to **vigilance** and spiritual alertness.
    - Christians are to live in expectation, not complacency.
    - The uncertainty of the timing is meant to foster continual readiness.
    - Faithful stewardship is required until the Lord returns.
    - "Since the day is hidden from us, we ought to be always prepared." (Commentary on Matthew 24:42)

5. **Christ’s Return as the Consummation of Redemption**
    - The **Parousia** will bring the final fulfillment of God’s promises.
    - The delay does not diminish the certainty of Christ’s return.
    - The hope of the **resurrection** and final judgment remains central.
    - The church’s longing for Christ’s return is both present and future-oriented.
    - "He will come, but at the time which he has appointed, to gather us into his everlasting kingdom." (Institutes 3.25.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s approach to the **delay of the Parousia** shaped subsequent **Reformed eschatology**, emphasizing trust in God’s hidden counsel and the importance of spiritual vigilance. His warnings against speculative date-setting influenced later Protestant caution regarding end-times predictions. Calvin’s insistence on the pastoral function of eschatology—calling believers to repentance and readiness—remains a hallmark of his enduring theological legacy.
