# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the **delay of the Parousia** through the lens of **religious consciousness** and the evolving self-understanding of the **Christian community**. He reinterpreted traditional eschatological expectations, emphasizing the ongoing presence of **Christ** in the life of the church rather than a literal, imminent **second coming**. For Schleiermacher, the significance of the Parousia lies in its transformative effect on **Christian piety** and ethical development.

- "The Redeemer is present to the Church, not as an individual to individuals, but as the Spirit of the new corporate life." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Parousia as Symbolic Presence**
    - The Parousia is not a future historical event but a symbol of Christ’s ongoing presence in the church.
    - Emphasizes the **immanence of Christ** within the community of believers.
    - Shifts focus from apocalyptic expectation to the lived experience of **redemption**.
    - Interprets eschatological language as expressing the deepening of **Christian consciousness**.
    - "The expectation of Christ’s return is fulfilled in the continual renewal of the Church’s life." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Historical Development of Doctrine**
    - Views the delay as evidence of the progressive unfolding of **Christian doctrine**.
    - Argues that the church’s understanding of eschatology matures over time.
    - Theological concepts adapt to the changing self-awareness of the community.
    - The delay prompts reinterpretation rather than disillusionment.
    - "Dogmas are not fixed, but develop as the religious self-consciousness of the Church matures." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - Grounds eschatological hope in the **feeling of absolute dependence**.
    - The Parousia is experienced inwardly through the transformation of the believer.
    - Downplays external, miraculous expectations in favor of inner renewal.
    - The delay highlights the ongoing nature of **salvation**.
    - "The essence of religion consists in the sense and taste for the Infinite." (On Religion)

4. **Ethical Implications of Eschatology**
    - The delay of the Parousia motivates ethical engagement in the world.
    - Eschatological hope inspires the pursuit of **moral transformation**.
    - The church’s mission is to embody Christ’s presence through love and justice.
    - The future is shaped by the community’s response to Christ’s call.
    - "The kingdom of God is realized in the ethical life of the community." (Christian Ethics)

5. **Critique of Literalism**
    - Rejects literal interpretations of biblical prophecy regarding the Parousia.
    - Advocates for a **hermeneutic** that recognizes symbolic and existential meanings.
    - The delay exposes the limitations of a purely historical reading of Scripture.
    - Encourages a dynamic, living faith over static doctrinal formulations.
    - "Scripture speaks in the language of the heart, not of the calendar." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of the **delay of the Parousia** profoundly influenced modern **liberal theology** and the development of **eschatology** as an existential and communal reality. His emphasis on **religious experience** and the symbolic presence of Christ shifted the focus of Christian hope from future events to present transformation. Subsequent theologians have built upon his insights, making his approach foundational for discussions of eschatology in the context of modernity and the ongoing life of the church.
