# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield addressed the **delay of the Parousia** within the broader framework of **Reformed eschatology**, emphasizing the sovereignty of God over redemptive history and the reliability of **Scripture**. He argued that the apparent postponement of Christ’s return is not a failure of prophecy but reflects the unfolding of God’s **redemptive plan**, particularly the gathering of the **elect** and the progress of the **gospel**. Warfield maintained that the **Second Coming** is certain, but its timing remains hidden within God’s providential purposes.

- "The Lord’s delay is not slackness, but long-suffering, giving space for repentance and the accomplishment of His gracious purposes." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

## Key Works

- "The Millennium and the Apocalypse" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Gospel of the Second Coming" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The New Testament Terminology of the Second Advent" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Idea of Systematic Theology" (for methodological context)
- "Revelation" (in The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Sovereignty over Eschatological Timelines**
    - God alone determines the timing of the **Parousia**.
    - Human perceptions of delay reflect limited understanding, not divine indecision.
    - The apparent postponement serves the fulfillment of God’s redemptive purposes.
    - The certainty of Christ’s return is grounded in God’s unchanging will.
    - "God’s purposes ripen slowly, but they never fail." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

2. **Scriptural Reliability and the Delay**
    - The New Testament does not teach an imminent return in the sense of a fixed date.
    - Apparent delays are anticipated within the biblical witness.
    - Prophetic language often employs **apocalyptic imagery** rather than precise chronology.
    - The trustworthiness of Scripture is not undermined by the ongoing wait for Christ’s return.
    - "The Scriptures do not commit themselves to any date, but urge constant readiness." ("The Gospel of the Second Coming")

3. **Purpose of the Delay: Gathering the Elect**
    - The delay allows for the full ingathering of the **elect** from all nations.
    - Evangelism and missions are integral to the period before the Parousia.
    - The church’s task is to proclaim the gospel until the appointed end.
    - The patience of God is an expression of His mercy toward sinners.
    - "The delay is the opportunity for the world’s salvation." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

4. **Christ’s Return as Certain but Unpredictable**
    - The Second Coming is a definite future event, not a mere ideal.
    - Its timing is unknown and unknowable to humanity.
    - Believers are called to live in expectancy and faithfulness.
    - Speculation about dates is discouraged as contrary to biblical teaching.
    - "No man knows the day or the hour, and it is not for us to know." ("The Gospel of the Second Coming")

5. **Eschatological Hope and Perseverance**
    - The delay fosters Christian perseverance and hope.
    - Suffering and tribulation are to be expected in the interim.
    - The church’s hope is anchored in the promise of Christ’s return.
    - The delay is not defeat, but a period of purposeful waiting.
    - "We wait, not in despair, but in hope, for the coming of our Lord." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of **divine sovereignty** and the reliability of **Scripture** shaped Reformed approaches to eschatology, especially regarding the delay of the Parousia. His insistence that the delay serves God’s redemptive purposes influenced later evangelical and Reformed thought, reinforcing the church’s mission and hope. Warfield’s careful exegesis and theological clarity continue to inform discussions on the **Second Coming** and the nature of biblical prophecy.
