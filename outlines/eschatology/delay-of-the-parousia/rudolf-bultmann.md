# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann addressed the **delay of the Parousia** by reinterpreting New Testament eschatology through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He argued that the expectation of Christ’s imminent return should not be understood as a literal, future event but as a call to authentic decision in the present, emphasizing the **kerygma** and the existential encounter with Christ rather than a chronological fulfillment.

- "The real meaning of the eschatological event is not a cosmic catastrophe, but the eschatological decision which is demanded of every man here and now." (Kerygma and Myth)

## Key Works

- "Kerygma and Myth" (1941, essays and responses)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Eschatology**
    - The New Testament’s apocalyptic language is mythological and must be reinterpreted for modern understanding.
    - The **delay of the Parousia** exposes the need to move beyond literal expectation.
    - Demythologization seeks the existential truth behind the mythic form.
    - The focus shifts from future events to present existential decision.
    - "Mythological eschatology is not a permanent element of Christian faith." (Kerygma and Myth)

2. **Existential Interpretation of the Parousia**
    - The Parousia is not a future historical event but a present existential reality.
    - Faith involves an encounter with the risen Christ in the proclamation (kerygma).
    - The urgency of eschatology is internalized as the call to authentic existence.
    - The delay highlights the need for decision in the present moment.
    - "Eschatology is not the end of history, but the end of my self-understanding in the world." (History and Eschatology)

3. **Kerygma as the Center of Christian Proclamation**
    - The message (kerygma) is the decisive event, not the expectation of a literal return.
    - The proclamation confronts hearers with the demand for faith now.
    - The delay of the Parousia redirects attention to the ongoing power of the Word.
    - The kerygma mediates the presence of Christ existentially.
    - "The kerygma itself is the eschatological event." (Kerygma and Myth)

4. **Critique of Apocalyptic Expectation**
    - Early Christian apocalypticism was historically conditioned and not essential.
    - The failed expectation of an imminent Parousia necessitates reinterpretation.
    - Apocalyptic motifs are to be understood symbolically, not literally.
    - The real significance lies in the existential transformation, not cosmic events.
    - "The apocalyptic expectation is only the form in which the demand for decision is clothed." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Faith as Decision in the Present**
    - The delay of the Parousia underscores the importance of present faith.
    - Authentic existence is realized in response to the call of Christ now.
    - The eschatological crisis is existential, not chronological.
    - The believer stands always at the threshold of decision, not awaiting future fulfillment.
    - "Faith means living in the presence of God here and now." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **delay of the Parousia** profoundly shaped modern New Testament theology, especially through his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. His work challenged traditional eschatological frameworks and redirected theological focus to the existential encounter with the kerygma. While controversial, Bultmann’s reinterpretation remains a pivotal reference point in debates over eschatology and the relevance of apocalyptic expectation in contemporary theology.
