# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner addressed the **delay of the Parousia** by emphasizing the existential and ethical implications of living in the "between times." He argued that the **eschatological hope** is not undermined by the delay but is instead reframed as a call to responsible action and faithfulness in the present. Brunner maintained that the **second coming of Christ** remains central to Christian faith, but its timing is subordinate to the ongoing encounter with God in history.

- "The Christian hope is not a calculation of dates, but the certainty that God will bring His work to completion." ("Eternal Hope")

## Key Works

- "Eternal Hope" (1954)
- "The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption" (Dogmatics, Vol. II, 1952)
- "The Mediator" (1934)
- "The Divine-Human Encounter" (1943)
- "Truth as Encounter" (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Existential Expectation**
    - The **delay of the Parousia** shifts focus from speculation to existential readiness.
    - Christian hope is grounded in the certainty of God's ultimate fulfillment, not in timetables.
    - The believer's life is characterized by anticipation and ethical responsibility.
    - The present is the arena for authentic encounter with God.
    - "The expectation of the End is not a matter of calculation, but of readiness." ("Eternal Hope")

2. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - The **second coming of Christ** is the focal point of Christian hope.
    - Brunner rejects attempts to demythologize or spiritualize the Parousia.
    - The delay does not diminish the reality or necessity of Christ's return.
    - Christ's lordship is affirmed both now and in the future consummation.
    - "The Parousia is the completion of the work of Christ, not its contradiction." ("The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption")

3. **Ethical Implications of the Delay**
    - The delay calls Christians to active engagement in the world.
    - Ethical responsibility is heightened by the uncertainty of the timing.
    - The church is to live as a sign of the coming kingdom.
    - Hope motivates perseverance and faithfulness in daily life.
    - "The Christian is called to live as if the Lord might come at any moment." ("Eternal Hope")

4. **Rejection of Apocalyptic Speculation**
    - Brunner warns against date-setting and apocalyptic fanaticism.
    - The meaning of the Parousia is theological, not chronological.
    - The delay exposes the folly of human attempts to control divine action.
    - Faith is trust in God's promise, not in human calculations.
    - "The time is God's secret; our task is faithfulness, not speculation." ("Eternal Hope")

5. **The Parousia and the Kingdom of God**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is both already present and not yet consummated.
    - The delay highlights the tension between the "now" and the "not yet."
    - The church lives in hope, witnessing to the coming reign of God.
    - The Parousia will bring the final realization of God's purposes in history.
    - "The Kingdom is present in promise, but its fulfillment awaits the Parousia." ("The Divine-Human Encounter")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to the **delay of the Parousia** influenced 20th-century Protestant eschatology by shifting the focus from speculative chronology to existential and ethical readiness. His emphasis on the **already/not yet** tension and the centrality of the **second coming of Christ** shaped later discussions on Christian hope and responsibility. Brunner’s thought remains significant for those seeking to balance eschatological expectation with active engagement in the world.
