# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer addressed the **delay of the Parousia** within the broader framework of **Reformed eschatology**, emphasizing the dynamic relationship between **God’s redemptive plan** and the unfolding of history. He rejected speculative timetables, focusing instead on the **ethical implications** of eschatological expectation and the ongoing significance of **Christ’s lordship** in the present age. For Berkouwer, the delay is not a theological problem but a call to **watchfulness** and **faithful living**.

- "The delay of the Parousia is not a postponement but a period filled with the riches of God’s patience and the call to repentance." (The Return of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Return of Christ (De wederkomst van Christus)
- The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Perseverance
- Studies in Dogmatics: The Return of Christ
- Holy Scripture: Revelation, Inspiration, and Interpretation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Dynamic Expectation**
    - Emphasizes the ongoing tension between the "already" and "not yet" of **redemptive history**.
    - Rejects static or purely futuristic conceptions of the **Parousia**.
    - Views the delay as integral to the unfolding of God’s purposes.
    - Stresses the ethical dimension of waiting for Christ’s return.
    - "The expectation of Christ’s return is not a passive waiting, but a dynamic involvement in the world." (The Return of Christ)

2. **Rejection of Speculative Chronology**
    - Critiques attempts to calculate or predict the timing of the **Parousia**.
    - Argues that Scripture intentionally leaves the timing ambiguous.
    - Warns against eschatological sensationalism within the church.
    - Upholds the mystery of God’s sovereign timing.
    - "Scripture does not satisfy our curiosity about times and seasons, but directs us to faith and obedience." (The Return of Christ)

3. **The Delay as Divine Patience**
    - Interprets the delay as an expression of **God’s patience** and mercy.
    - Connects the delay to the ongoing call to **repentance** and mission.
    - Sees the period between the advents as a time of grace, not abandonment.
    - Relates the delay to the fulfillment of the **Great Commission**.
    - "The so-called delay is filled with the riches of God’s patience, not with emptiness or absence." (The Return of Christ)

4. **Christ’s Present Lordship**
    - Affirms that Christ reigns now, even as believers await his return.
    - The delay does not diminish the reality of **Christ’s kingship**.
    - Encourages the church to live under Christ’s authority in the present.
    - The Parousia will consummate, not inaugurate, Christ’s reign.
    - "The church lives in the certainty of Christ’s lordship, even as it prays, ‘Come, Lord Jesus.’" (The Return of Christ)

5. **Ethical Implications of Eschatological Hope**
    - The delay calls believers to **watchfulness** and **faithful service**.
    - Eschatological hope motivates engagement, not withdrawal, from the world.
    - The church’s mission is energized by the expectation of Christ’s return.
    - Ethical living is inseparable from true eschatological faith.
    - "The expectation of the Parousia is inseparable from the call to holiness and service." (The Return of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced approach to the **delay of the Parousia** shaped Reformed eschatological thought by emphasizing the theological and ethical significance of waiting. His rejection of speculative timetables and focus on the present implications of **Christ’s lordship** influenced both academic theology and pastoral practice. Berkouwer’s work continues to guide those seeking a biblically grounded, hope-filled, and responsible approach to eschatology within the Reformed tradition.
