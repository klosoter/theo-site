# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth addressed the **delay of the Parousia** within his broader **Christocentric eschatology**, emphasizing that the timing of Christ’s return is subordinate to the ongoing reality of **God’s revelation** in Jesus Christ. For Barth, the **eschatological event** is not a future calendar date but the ever-present encounter with the risen Lord, which relativizes human expectations of chronological fulfillment and places the emphasis on **faithful vigilance** and **hope**.

- "The Christian waits, but he waits in the light of the resurrection, and therefore he waits for what is already present." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics IV/3: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics III/2: The Doctrine of Creation
- Church Dogmatics I/2: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (especially the commentary on Romans 13)
- Dogmatics in Outline

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Center of Eschatology**
    - The meaning of the **Parousia** is found in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in the completed work of Christ, not in speculative chronology.
    - The presence of Christ is both a past event and a present reality for the church.
    - The future return is inseparable from the ongoing revelation of Christ.
    - "The future of Jesus Christ is not a second act, but the unveiling of what has already taken place." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

2. **Revelation Determines Eschatological Expectation**
    - Human knowledge of the **Parousia** is limited by the self-disclosure of God.
    - The delay is not a problem to be solved but a mystery to be received in faith.
    - The church lives in the tension between the 'already' and the 'not yet.'
    - Eschatological fulfillment is always God’s initiative, not human calculation.
    - "We do not know the times or the seasons; we know only the One who comes." (Dogmatics in Outline)

3. **Vigilance and Hope in the Present**
    - The church is called to **watchfulness** and readiness, not speculation.
    - The delay serves to orient believers toward faithful living in the present.
    - Hope is sustained by the promise, not by visible signs or timetables.
    - The Parousia is a summons to ethical responsibility and mission.
    - "The Christian life is lived in expectation, but it is an expectation that acts." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

4. **Critique of Chronological Speculation**
    - Barth rejects attempts to calculate or predict the timing of Christ’s return.
    - Theological focus should remain on the certainty of God’s promise, not its scheduling.
    - The delay exposes the futility of human attempts to control eschatological events.
    - The church’s proclamation is about Christ, not about end-times speculation.
    - "To ask 'When?' is to misunderstand the nature of the promise." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

5. **Eschatology as the Shape of Christian Existence**
    - The delay of the Parousia shapes the church’s identity as a pilgrim people.
    - Christian existence is marked by **anticipation** and **participation** in God’s ongoing work.
    - The church lives between the resurrection and the consummation, defined by hope.
    - The delay is not absence, but the mode of Christ’s presence in the Spirit.
    - "We live between the times, but we live in the light of the end." (Dogmatics in Outline)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s approach to the **delay of the Parousia** redirected eschatological discussion from speculative chronology to the centrality of **Christ’s ongoing presence** and the ethical implications for the church. His emphasis on **revelation** and the "already/not yet" tension has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the Reformed tradition. Barth’s legacy endures in his insistence that Christian hope is rooted in the certainty of God’s promise, not in human calculation or anxiety over delay.
