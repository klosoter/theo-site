### TITLE
The So-Called Delay of the Parousia: Apostolic Eschatology, Historical Pressures, and the Integrity of New Testament Hope

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: whether and how the New Testament expectation of Christ’s **Parousia** can be coherently maintained in light of the apparent “delay” of his coming, without collapsing apostolic authority, biblical inerrancy, or eschatological hope.
- Decisive figures: Albert Schweitzer, C H Dodd, Oscar Cullmann, Rudolf Bultmann, N T Wright.
- Relevant traditions: early Christian apocalyptic and patristic exegesis, critical historical theology of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Reformed and evangelical doctrines of **inerrancy**, **eschatology**, and **providence**, and contemporary New Testament scholarship on apocalyptic and inaugurated eschatology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: differing conservative strategies for handling “imminence,” realized vs futurist emphases, preterist vs futurist readings of key texts.
  - External: classic liberal claims of failed apocalyptic expectation, existential reinterpretation of eschatology, secular critiques of prophetic failure.
  - Contemporary: the meaning of “imminence,” the status of time and **divine patience**, second-temple apocalyptic background, and how to preach the Parousia now.
- Defended position: the “delay of the Parousia” is a misframed problem; rightly interpreted, the New Testament teaches a theologically coherent **imminent yet open-ended** eschatology in which Christ’s return is certain, temporally indeterminate within the divine plan, and already partially realized, so that there is no failure of apostolic expectation or biblical authority.

### ESSAY
The phrase “delay of the Parousia” already risks distorting the New Testament’s own categories. To speak of a “delay” implies a scheduled time that has been missed, an eschatological appointment God set and failed to keep. Yet the central New Testament emphasis is not on a missed timetable but on the certainty, nearness, and unpredictability of the **Parousia** of the risen Christ. Properly framed, the question becomes whether the apostles taught a chronologically mistaken expectation of the end, and whether nearly two thousand years of continuing history expose an inner incoherence in the Christian doctrine of **eschatology**. Because Westminster examiners will probe the doctrinal ripple effects, this issue cannot be quarantined from **inerrancy**, **Christology**, **providence**, and **the doctrine of Scripture**. If Christ and the apostles were wrong about something so central, the entire dogmatic structure is destabilized. My contention is that the “delay of the Parousia” problem arises from reading the New Testament through modern historicist assumptions rather than through its own covenantal and apocalyptic logic. Once the categories of **imminence**, **inaugurated eschatology**, and **divine patience** are rightly ordered, the charge of eschatological failure cannot be sustained.

Albert Schweitzer stands as the watershed figure for the modern formulation of the problem. Writing in the context of nineteenth century historical criticism and its confident reconstruction of “the historical Jesus,” Schweitzer argued in The Quest of the Historical Jesus that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet wholly determined by the expectation of an imminent end. For Schweitzer, Jesus expected the apocalyptic arrival of the kingdom within the lifetime of his contemporaries. Key texts such as Mark 9.1, Matthew 10.23, and Mark 13.30 were read as straightforward chronological predictions. When the end did not come, Jesus died in despair, and the early church reinterpreted his failure as redemptive suffering. On Schweitzer’s reading, Christianity is built on a mistake: the mistaken expectation of an imminent cosmic transformation. Schweitzer’s conceptual contribution was to shift the center of gravity from dogmatic synthesis to an allegedly unvarnished apocalyptic Jesus, thereby forcing the question whether the New Testament can be doctrinally true if it is historically wrong about the timing of the end.

Schweitzer’s challenge defines the external debate at a fundamental level. If Jesus and the apostles were governed by a mistaken apocalyptic timetable, then any attempt to preserve **biblical inerrancy** or the full authority of Christ’s teaching seems vain. Liberal theology in his wake often adopted precisely this conclusion: the apocalyptic core of early Christianity was untenable, but one could still salvage a moral kernel or an existential attitude. Examiners will press you: If Schweitzer is right that Jesus predicted the imminent end and was wrong, can you still affirm Chalcedonian **Christology** and the sinlessness of Christ’s human knowledge? The answer, I will argue, is that Schweitzer has misread both the texts and the nature of prophetic and apocalyptic discourse. The New Testament does not present Jesus as a failed apocalyptic visionary but as the Lord of history who inaugurates the last days in his death and resurrection and reserves the exact timing of his return in the Father’s secret counsel.

If Schweitzer pressed an apocalyptic Jesus whose expectation failed, C H Dodd countered with what he termed **realized eschatology**. Dodd’s work, especially The Parables of the Kingdom and The Apostolic Preaching and its Developments, emphasized that in Jesus’ ministry the kingdom of God has already come. For Dodd, eschatology is largely fulfilled in the historical coming of Jesus and the birth of the church; the imagery of future judgment and cosmic consummation is symbolic language for the decisive crisis now confronting humanity in the encounter with Christ. The “delay” of the Parousia is then less a problem because the real eschaton has already occurred. Dodd’s reading underscores genuine biblical themes: Jesus does proclaim that the kingdom has drawn near, that in his exorcisms and healings the reign of God is already at work. Yet Dodd’s reduction of future expectation to present fulfillment proves unstable. It risks evacuating the robust futurity of texts like 1 Thessalonians 4, 1 Corinthians 15, or Revelation 21, where the bodily **resurrection**, visible return, and new creation remain outstanding events.

The internal debate here, especially in Reformed and evangelical circles, turns on how strongly we may affirm **realized eschatology** without surrendering the future dimension of hope. Some conservative readings, reacting to Schweitzer, overemphasize futurity and underplay present realization, while others, eager to meet Dodd’s historical criticisms, absorb too much of his program and flatten New Testament expectations into an existentially present kingdom. Examiners will ask: Are you a futurist or a realized eschatologist? The correct answer is that the New Testament teaches an inaugurated or “already and not yet” eschatology: Christ has inaugurated the last days decisively in his resurrection and Pentecost, yet the full **consummation** awaits his future appearing. Both Schweitzer and Dodd seize on one pole of this tension and absolutize it.

Oscar Cullmann refined this dialectic in a way that remains indispensable. In Christ and Time, Cullmann contrasted the cyclical conceptions of time in Hellenistic thought with the linear, redemptive-historical timeline of Scripture. His famous D-Day and V-Day analogy captures inaugurated eschatology: with Christ’s death and resurrection, the decisive battle has occurred, like D-Day in 1944, but the war is only finally ended at V-Day, corresponding to the Parousia. For Cullmann the New Testament does not miscalculate the end but locates believers in the tension between decisive victory and awaiting consummation. Cullmann also paid careful attention to the language of the “last days” in the New Testament, arguing that the early Christians rightly understood themselves as already living in the eschatological era.

Cullmann’s contribution is decisive for integrating internal theological concerns with external historical criticism. His model preserves the objectivity of future hope against Dodd while avoiding Schweitzer’s thesis of failed imminence. It offers a nuanced account of **apocalyptic** imagery as historically referential but not tied to rigid chronological predictions. Yet one must sharpen Cullmann’s framework by explicitly addressing the texts commonly invoked by Schweitzer. For example, Mark 13.30, where Jesus says “this generation will not pass away until all these things take place,” must be handled carefully. A responsible inaugurated eschatology will argue that much of the Olivet Discourse refers to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 and the judgment on apostate Israel, which indeed occurred within a generation, while the final cosmic coming of the Son of Man remains future. This is a form of partial preterism that sits comfortably within **Reformed eschatology** and avoids the total relativization of prophecy while responding directly to Schweitzer’s chronological critique.

Rudolf Bultmann, though critical of Schweitzer on some points, radicalizes the external challenge by denying the possibility of maintaining apocalyptic expectation in a modern scientific age. For Bultmann, the mythological worldview of the New Testament, including its expectation of a literal Parousia, is incompatible with modern cosmology. His program of **demythologization** aims to extract the existential kerygma from mythic clothing. In this framework, the Parousia is reinterpreted as the existential encounter with the word of the cross in the present; the call to decision is the true “coming” of Christ. Delay becomes a non-problem because there never was, in any theologically serious sense, a future cosmic coming to be delayed.

Bultmann’s move, however, comes at the cost of the concrete historical hope of the gospel. By dissolving the Parousia into existential decision, he severs **eschatology** from history. Examiners will press: Is Bultmann’s demythologization just a sophisticated concession to liberalism, or does he preserve something valuable? You should grant that Bultmann exposes the naivety of simply repristinating ancient apocalyptic imagery without reflection on genre and worldview. Yet his deeper claim that myth must be stripped away in order to find a timeless existential core contradicts the grain of biblical revelation, which is relentlessly historical, covenantal, and public. The resurrection itself, the cornerstone of apostolic preaching, is not a mere symbol of existential renewal but a concrete event in history. Likewise the Parousia is not simply a metaphor but the promised future act of the same Lord who rose.

Against these external challenges, contemporary scholarship, especially represented by N T Wright, has significantly reframed the discussion. Wright, immersed in second-temple Jewish apocalyptic and covenant thought, argues that much modern debate over the “delay” is misdirected because it assumes an unJewish, decontextualized reading of Jesus’ kingdom language. In works such as Jesus and the Victory of God and Paul and the Faithfulness of God, Wright contends that Jesus’ apocalyptic predictions about the coming of the Son of Man, judgment, and the shaking of the heavens are first and foremost symbolic and prophetic descriptions of the impending destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, which occurred in 70. The “coming” of the Son of Man in Daniel 7 imagery is not a descent to earth but a coming to the Ancient of Days, a vindication. Thus, the generation sayings do not predict the end of the world but the climactic covenantal crisis of Israel. On this reading there is no failure: what was predicted within a generation happened within a generation.

Wright’s insistence on second-temple Jewish context is a major corrective to the abstracted, de-Judaized reconstructions of Schweitzer and Bultmann. He restores the covenantal and political dimensions of Jesus’ message and avoids the charge that Jesus promised something he did not deliver. Furthermore, Wright maintains a robust future dimension of **new creation**: the resurrection of the body, renewal of creation, and final appearing of Christ remain essential. Yet some caution is warranted. Wright’s approach can be overstated so that virtually all seemingly futurist texts in the Gospels are preterized into the first century, leaving the church with a more attenuated explicit expectation of a definitive future Parousia. Examiners may push: Does Wright’s preterist emphasis undermine the clarity of future hope? A balanced stance would affirm Wright’s hermeneutical insight into the 70 event while maintaining that New Testament eschatology transcends that horizon in Paul, Hebrews, and Revelation. The exhortations to watchfulness, the promise that “every eye will see him,” and the expectation of the transformation of the cosmos cannot be compressed into first-century political catastrophe alone.

So how should one integrate these strands into a coherent dogmatic account that can withstand cross examination? First, one must clarify what “imminence” means in biblical terms. The New Testament does not give a date but speaks of the end as “near,” “at hand,” and presents believers as those upon whom the ends of the ages have come. The logic is covenantal and redemptive-historical rather than chronological in a modern sense. With Christ’s death, resurrection, and Pentecost the decisive turning of the ages has already occurred. Nothing remains in the economy of redemption that must happen before the Lord may return. That is the core of **imminent yet open-ended** expectation. Imminence speaks to contingency from the human vantage point and to the completeness of Christ’s work, not to a countdown clock.

Second, one must insist on the Creator–creature distinction and **divine simplicity** when examiners press on God’s relation to time. The claim that God “delays” presupposes that God is measured by a temporal framework external to himself. Classical Christian theism affirms that God is eternal, not in the sense of endless temporal duration, but in the sense of transcending temporal succession. The New Testament itself gestures toward this when it says that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. The “delay” is therefore a feature of creaturely experience within God’s wise **providence**. Within that providential plan, the period between Christ’s ascension and Parousia is not an embarrassing stretch of unforeseen postponement, but the appointed time of **gospel mission** and **divine patience**, in which God is not slow as some count slowness but patient, not wishing that any should perish.

Third, the mode of prophetic and apocalyptic discourse must be respected. Biblical prophecy often telescopes events, grouping near and far horizons in a single field of vision. Isaiah’s prophecies of return from exile intertwine historical restoration and eschatological new creation. Similarly, Jesus and the apostles may speak of the destruction of Jerusalem, the judgments of history, and the final Parousia in a single prophetic complex, using the same imagery of cosmic upheaval. This compression does not entail error, because the point of prophetic speech is not to satiate chronological curiosity but to summon repentance, perseverance, and hope. Attempts to decode a precise timetable, whether by nineteenth century critics or modern dispensational date setters, misunderstand the genre.

Fourth, one must integrate the doctrine of the Parousia with **Christology** and **soteriology**. The risen Christ’s present reign is not a placeholder until he “really” reigns in the future. He is already Lord, seated at the right hand of the Father, subduing his enemies. The future Parousia is the unveiling of his already existing sovereignty, the public manifestation of what is now hidden. This is why the New Testament links the Parousia to the final justification, resurrection, and glorification of believers. The time between is the time of **sanctification** and mission under the cross. To suggest that Christ erred about the timing of his return would compromise his prophetic office, the perfection of his human knowledge as perfectly suited to his mediatorial vocation, and ultimately the coherency of the gospel. A Reformed defense will therefore hold that any alleged prediction of a specific earliest possible date for the end is a misreading; Christ explicitly disclaims knowledge of the day and hour according to his mediatorial role, and the apostles never set a calendar, only press the church to live as those who may meet the Lord at any moment.

What, then, of texts that seem to teach that the apostles expected the end within their lifetime? Some passages speak of “we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord.” This is natural pastoral rhetoric of solidarity, not a mistaken assertion that Paul knew he would be alive. Elsewhere Paul contemplates his own death and the long-term endurance of the church. Hebrews speaks of “yet a little while,” James says the judge is standing at the door. These expressions function exhortationally: they collapse the distance to the end in order to foster vigilance and holiness. From the standpoint of an individual life, the Parousia is always near, because death ushers each believer into the immediate presence of Christ and the fixedness of eternal destiny. The divine design is that every generation live under the pressure of possible consummation, precisely to prevent complacency.

Internally, within conservative theology, a major debate concerns preterist versus futurist schemas, especially in relation to 2 Peter 3 and Revelation. Some full preterists claim that all eschatological promises, including the Parousia and resurrection, were fulfilled in the first century. This view, however, cannot do justice to the bodily resurrection of the dead, the abolition of death, and the new heavens and new earth as presented in Scripture. Orthodox Reformed theology must insist on a still future, visible, bodily return of Christ and a universal resurrection. Partial preterism, by contrast, rightly sees many prophetic judgments fulfilled historically, while upholding a final consummation. This position best answers the delay question: significant elements of Jesus’ and the apostles’ predictions have already been fulfilled in identifiable history, confirming the reliability of their words, while the open-endedness of the final consummation is maintained.

Contemporary debates add another layer: How should we preach the Parousia in a technological, allegedly disenchanted age? Secular critics argue that two thousand years of waiting expose Christian hope as illusion. In response, one must reassert that the timescale of **redemptive history** cannot be converted into the impatient tempo of modernity. The same Lord who orchestrated centuries between Abraham and Christ orders the time between the first and second coming. Moreover, the very persistence of the church and the global spread of the gospel fulfil Jesus’ own prophecies that the message would be preached in all nations before the end. The so-called delay is not a defeater but the stage on which Christ exhibits the power of his resurrection through the conversion and perseverance of countless believers across cultures and centuries.

My defended position, then, is that the “delay of the Parousia” is best understood as a misframed problem created by importing modern chronological expectations into apocalyptic discourse. The New Testament presents Christ’s return as certain, imminent in the sense of being the next major act in the economy of redemption, but divinely indeterminate in its exact timing. Inaugurated eschatology, rightly articulated along lines suggested by Cullmann and refined by Wright’s attention to first-century context, shows that much of what was expected has in fact occurred, while the final consummation remains outstanding. Schweitzer’s charge of failed apocalypticism and Bultmann’s demythologizing response both collapse under closer textual and theological scrutiny. Dodd’s realized eschatology overcorrects Schweitzer but undervalues futurity. Maintaining **biblical inerrancy**, classical **theism**, and a full-orbed doctrine of Christ, one can and should affirm that there is no divine failure, no apostolic mistake, but only the wise and patient unfolding of the Father’s plan until the day when the Son is revealed from heaven.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The “delay of the Parousia” designates the alleged problem that Jesus and the apostles expected Christ’s return imminently and were proved wrong by the long interval of church history; properly understood, Scripture teaches a **certain, imminent yet open-ended** Parousia within an inaugurated eschatological framework, not a missed deadline.
- Decisive figures:
  - Albert Schweitzer: framed Jesus as a mistaken apocalyptic prophet whose failed expectation undercuts traditional dogma.
  - C H Dodd: stressed **realized eschatology**, seeing fulfillment in Jesus’ ministry and the church, reducing robust futurity.
  - Oscar Cullmann: articulated inaugurated eschatology and linear **redemptive history**, preserving both “already” and “not yet.”
  - Rudolf Bultmann: demythologized apocalyptic imagery into existential decision, abandoning a concrete future Parousia.
  - N T Wright: recontextualized Jesus’ apocalyptic language in second-temple Judaism and 70, combining preterist insight with ongoing future hope.
- Debates:
  - Internal: how to balance realized and future **eschatology**, partial preterism vs full preterism vs futurism, the meaning of “imminence,” and harmonizing these with **inerrancy** and **Christology**.
  - External: liberal claims of failed apocalyptic, existential reinterpretations that evacuate history, and secular arguments from prophetic failure.
  - Contemporary: preaching hope after long delay, understanding divine **patience** and providence, and the role of apocalyptic genre in interpretation.
- Defended position: There is no real “delay” in the sense of divine failure or apostolic error; the New Testament teaches that in Christ the last days have begun, that much prophesied judgment has already occurred in history, and that the final visible Parousia remains certain but temporally indeterminate in God’s eternal plan, compatible with **biblical inerrancy** and classical **theism**.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Did Jesus make a mistaken prediction about the timing of his return? No, he explicitly denies knowing the day and hour in his mediatorial role and speaks in apocalyptic, telescoping categories that do not constitute a failed date-setting.
  - How do you reconcile “this generation will not pass away” with a still-future Parousia? By seeing a primary reference to the 70 judgment on Jerusalem, fulfilled within a generation, alongside a further horizon of final consummation.
  - What does “imminence” mean if two thousand years have passed? It means that no further redemptive events are required before Christ’s return and that believers in every age are rightly called to watchfulness.
  - Does inaugurated eschatology undermine future hope? No, it grounds future hope in an already accomplished victory, ensuring that consummation is the extension, not the negation, of present realities.
  - How does this topic bear on inerrancy and Christology? If the delay is misframed and no failed prediction exists, then apostolic and dominical teaching remains fully trustworthy, preserving the sinlessness and prophetic perfection of Christ and the reliability of Scripture.
