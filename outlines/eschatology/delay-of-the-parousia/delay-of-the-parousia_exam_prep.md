### ESSAY
The so‑called delay of the Parousia names a perceived tension: the New Testament speaks as if the return of Christ is near, yet centuries have passed without the consummation. The charge is that Christian proclamation either misread Jesus or that Jesus himself was mistaken. The doctrine of the Parousia thus pressures claims about the nature of **revelation**, the reliability of **Scripture**, Christ’s prophetic office, the character of **divine eternity**, and the shape of ecclesial patience and urgency. A defensible account must do more than harmonize texts. It must show that imminence and delay are intrinsically coherent when read through the grammar of redemptive history, the idiom of biblical prophecy, and the nature of God’s covenantal dealings in time.

Albert Schweitzer framed the modern problem with rare force. In The Quest of the Historical Jesus and The Mystery of the Kingdom of God, Schweitzer argued that Jesus proclaimed the imminent end of the age, expected the Son of Man’s appearing within the lifetime of his contemporaries, and died to force or hasten the eschatological crisis. For Schweitzer, the ethical program of the Sermon on the Mount is not a timeless ideal but an interim ethic for the last days, and the apostolic church was a movement living off the shockwave of an eschatology that failed to occur. Schweitzer’s decisive contribution lies in his insistence that first‑century Jewish apocalyptic provided the native horizon of Jesus’ message. He read texts like Mark 13 and Matthew 10 and 24 with a literal imminence that verged on calendar prediction. When the end did not occur, the church spiritualized and moralized Jesus’ message. The delay thus becomes the engine of theological mutation. Some dismissed his reconstruction as historical cynicism, yet he fixed the terms of debate by demanding that imminence be taken at face value. The resultant dilemma is stark: either history has falsified Jesus, or later theology must rescue him by reinterpretation.

C. H. Dodd’s response was to push in the opposite direction. His realized eschatology contended that the eschaton arrived in the ministry of Jesus. Eternal life is present rather than postponed. Judgment is now. The kingdom is realized where Jesus is. Dodd tightened the grammar of John’s Gospel and pressed the already into the foreground everywhere. On this view the Parousia language functions symbolically to describe the decisive inbreaking of God achieved in Christ’s words and deeds. Delay is defused because the New Testament never meant what Schweitzer thinks it meant. The problem with Dodd’s move is that it often evacuates the concrete hope of resurrection of the body, the new heavens and new earth, and the visible appearing of Christ in glory. If everything is already realized, the church’s groaning and the promise of cosmic renewal become dramatic metaphors, not historical commitments. While Dodd properly stressed that the kingdom is not simply future, his reduction leaves the future horizon thin and the language of the Lord’s coming imprecise. Examiner challenge: does Dodd preserve the integrity of bodily resurrection and final judgment, or does he assimilate them to present existential experience? The latter is the operative tendency, and it creates its own crisis of coherence.

Oscar Cullmann proposed a third way that proved conceptually decisive. In Christ and Time he formulated inaugurated eschatology: the decisive victory has occurred in the death and resurrection of Christ, but the war continues until the Parousia. His D‑Day and V‑Day analogy has limits, yet it captures a basic pattern that pervades the New Testament. The age to come has intruded into the present through the gift of the Spirit, the justification of the ungodly, and the creation of a new humanity. Believers have the firstfruits and the down payment, but not the fullness. On this model, imminence is not a miscalculation but a covenantal posture of watchfulness appropriate to those living in the overlap of the ages. Delay is not failure but the theater of **divine patience** and mission. Cullmann thus rescued Schweitzer’s historical seriousness about apocalyptic horizons while resisting Dodd’s collapse of future hope. The question is whether such inaugurated eschatology can carry the weight of texts that speak of events occurring in that generation and within a rapidly closing window. The answer requires attention to prophetic idiom, to the multiple referents of coming language, and to how Jesus maps near and far horizons.

Geerhardus Vos, the father of Reformed biblical theology, supplies the hermeneutical architecture needed to resolve the tension. In The Pauline Eschatology and in his biblical theology lectures, Vos insisted that eschatology is not a late addendum but the inner structure of revelation from the beginning. Two aeons, this age and the age to come, interpenetrate in the Messiah. The Spirit is the earnest of the inheritance, a pledge that both secures and anticipates the consummation. Vos explicates the **already and not yet** with close textual work across Paul and the Gospels, refusing both Schweitzer’s despair and Dodd’s flattening. Critically for the so‑called delay, Vos recovers the **prophetic perspective** that compresses temporal horizons without collapsing their distinction. Isaiah can speak of near deliverance and ultimate renewal in a single oracle. Jesus, standing in that line, speaks of his coming in judgment on Jerusalem and his final appearing using shared imagery because both are coherent acts of the enthroned Son of Man. On this reading, texts like Matthew 24 include both near referents, such as the fall of Jerusalem, and the ultimate Parousia. The generation language can thus be satisfied in the near horizon without abolishing the final horizon.

N. T. Wright represents a powerful contemporary elaboration of this line. In Jesus and the Victory of God and related works, Wright argues that the coming of the Son of Man in the Gospels is primarily a symbol for the vindication and enthronement of Jesus manifest in the fall of Jerusalem. The language derives from Daniel 7, where the son of man comes to the Ancient of Days rather than to earth. The decisive coming has already occurred in the ascension as earthly manifestation follows in seventy. Wright’s hermeneutic of Jewish apocalyptic idiom thereby relocates the force of imminence to events within living memory of Jesus’ hearers. One must register, however, the risk of over‑preterizing the New Testament. The church does not confess only a coming in judgment in the first century but the appearing in glory to judge the living and the dead. Wright himself affirms that future hope, yet some of his readers have flattened the horizon, undermining the concrete expectation of a visible Parousia and the resurrection of the dead. A Vosian corrective is needed so that multiple horizons can be distinguished without dichotomy.

Richard Bauckham’s study of 2 Peter and Jude adds another indispensable dimension. The scoffers ask, where is the promise of his coming. The apostolic answer is not that the promise has been redefined away but that the Lord is not slow as we count slowness. God’s time is not ours. With the Lord a thousand years are as one day. This is not a metaphysical dodge but a pastoral assertion of **divine patience** oriented toward repentance and salvation. Bauckham highlights that 2 Peter grounds delay in the moral character of God. The doctrine of **divine eternity** operates here not to detach God from history but to render him sovereignly free over it. Time is God’s creature. The delay does not expose indecision but reveals mercy. Examiner challenge: does this text simply pull a timelessness card to deflect scrutiny. Response: no; the argument hinges on covenantal patience, not abstract timelessness. The point is not that God’s clocks are different but that God governs time to fulfill his saving purpose, and he has disclosed that purpose. The promise is secure, yet the church must not confuse patience with forgetfulness.

These decisive figures together enable a coherent position that avoids the false alternatives of failed prophecy on one side and demythologized spirituality on the other. The core claim to defend is that the New Testament’s imminence language is covenantal, ethical, and redemptive‑historical rather than calendrical prediction; that Jesus spoke in the idiom of the prophets where near and far events are narrated with shared imagery; that the fall of Jerusalem is both judgment and vindication that anticipates the universal appearing; and that the present age of the church exists under the sign of **already and not yet**, where the certainty of the end and the uncertainty of its date co‑inhere by design.

Internal debates press this claim on multiple fronts. Within conservative and Reformed traditions, a partial preterist reading of Matthew 24 and parallels competes with futurist readings that relocate most of the discourse to the end. A Vosian synthesis is most defensible. The abomination of desolation, the encircling of Jerusalem by armies, and the flight of disciples from the city fit the first century. The cosmic imagery, the gathering of the elect, and the universal visibility of the Son of Man stretch beyond. The discourse is not a code to decode but a prophetic tapestry whose threads are meant to be discerned. Similarly, debates over the millennium and the order of events can distract from the more basic structure. Amillennialism, as refined through Augustine and Reformed theology, reads Revelation’s thousand years symbolically as the present reign of Christ, and thus neutralizes the panic that delay generates within premillennial timetables. Postmillennial optimism raises a different risk, namely, mistaking historical improvement for eschatological nearness. Theologically, the healthier criterion for imminence is not trend lines but the posture of watchful obedience because no man knows the day or the hour. Examiner objection: does the doctrine of **divine simplicity** and **immutability** compromise genuine responsiveness in time and therefore render the language of patience hollow. The Reformed answer is that God’s single, simple act of willing has temporal effects that are genuinely successive for creatures. He truly wills patience without changing and governs contingencies without being contingent. This sustains both promise and patience without collapsing one into the other.

External debates reprise Schweitzer’s charge in modern dress. Demythologizers argue that apocalyptic is a symbolic myth for existential self‑understanding. The Parousia collapses into decision, judgment into authenticity, and resurrection into kerygmatic proclamation. The price is obvious: apostolic proclamation loses its historical referent and turns into theology of experience. Dispensationalism provides a different external pressure. While defending the visible return, it often reduces imminence to a program of signs and intervals. When those sequences fail or are reconfigured repeatedly, faith is made hostage to elaborate charts, and delay swings between frenetic date setting and disillusionment. A Reformed inaugurated account spares both rationalistic demythologization and speculative calendarism. It anchors hope in history accomplished and promised, refuses to psychologize the future, and resists curiosity that Jesus explicitly rebukes.

Contemporary debates require attention to mission, ethics, and the doctrine of God. The long church age is not an embarrassment but the sphere of the Spirit’s worldwide work. The gospel must be preached to all nations and then the end will come. This is not a condition that binds God, as if he were waiting helplessly, but a revealed means by which he gathers the elect. The delay thus turns mission from optional program to eschatological necessity. Any adoption of open theism to explain delay by positing divine ignorance or changing plans should be rejected as incompatible with **divine foreknowledge** and **providence**. The Lord who is patient is the Lord who has set the day. At the same time, the doctrine of **divine eternity** must be articulated analogically. God is not situated in a cosmic timeline, yet he acts in time truly. His eternity does not render time illusory but rather establishes its reality and theater for covenant fellowship. The church’s liturgy and sacraments embody this. Baptism is union with the once‑for‑all death and resurrection, the Supper is communion with the risen Christ and anticipation of the marriage feast. The sacraments are eschatological signs within history that train the church in **analogical knowledge** of time and promise.

At this point, an examiner may surface three pressure points. First, did Jesus predict his return within the lifetime of his hearers. Answer: he predicted the near judgment on Jerusalem and spoke of the Son of Man’s vindication in ways that anticipate and prefigure his final appearing. The coming of the Son of Man in the clouds language is drawn from Daniel and refers to enthronement and judgment. The near horizon is real; the final horizon remains. Second, does the New Testament use soon language in ways that are dishonest if two millennia intervene. Answer: the soon of Revelation and the near of the epistles function covenantally to cultivate vigilance, to assure justice, and to locate the church in the last days inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection. The last hour is a theological designation of the ages with the Spirit as proof. Third, does appeal to prophetic idiom reduce specificity to a literary trick. Answer: prophetic idiom is not a trick but a disciplined, covenantal way of speaking that binds God’s acts to his promises in typological sequences. The exodus prefigures the return from exile, which prefigures the cross and resurrection, which prefigures the new creation. Near fulfillments establish the pattern and guarantee of the ultimate. This is biblical, not evasive.

Albert Schweitzer deserves extended engagement because his challenge, though overstated, forced clarity. His unsparing insistence that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet was and remains salutary. Yet Schweitzer’s confidence that the end must be understood as a failed countdown rests on a wooden literalism foreign to prophetic discourse and a refusal to acknowledge how Jesus reconfigures eschatology around his own person. Where Schweitzer sees disconfirmation, the apostles see confirmation: the enthroned Christ pours out the Spirit, judges the covenant city, turns to the nations, and awaits the appointed day. The point is not to salvage Jesus by stretching language but to read Jesus as he located himself in the line of Isaiah and Daniel. Further, Schweitzer’s ethic‑of‑interim thesis mistakes the categorical novelty of the new covenant for temporary rules. The Sermon’s ethic is not rendered void by delay because it is the ethic of the kingdom that has already arrived in principle and awaits its consummation in glory.

Geerhardus Vos merits extended treatment because he provides the theological grammar that secures this coherence across loci. By reading eschatology as the structural horizon of all revelation, Vos reorients the doctrine of history. Creation is teleological. Adam was created for consummation. The second Adam has secured that consummation. All of soteriology is ordered accordingly. **Justification** is a verdict of the last day announced now. **Sanctification** is the life of the age to come breaking in now through the Spirit. **Adoption** is the conferment of eschatological sonship in time. The church is the eschatological people, an embassy of the new creation within the old. Imminence thus is not a countdown but the moral and spiritual stance that belongs to citizens of the age to come. Delay is not theological embarrassment but vocational sphere. Vos also secures coherence with **divine simplicity** and **immutability**. The God who decrees the end decrees the means. There is no tension between patience and promise because both are modes of one simple will toward the glory of his Son in the church.

Oscar Cullmann, though already commended, deserves a note of caution and appreciation. His D‑Day analogy is lucid but can be overplayed. The war metaphor does not mean a stalemate between equal powers. The devil is a defeated foe within the sovereignty of God. The analogy nevertheless helps the church to understand why suffering and groaning persist without inferring divine delay as impotence. It also discloses why the church’s mission is not an afterthought. The time between resurrection and Parousia is ordered to the gathering of the saints and the public display of the manifold wisdom of God. Cullmann, more than Dodd, preserves the forward thrust of hope while refusing Schweitzer’s pessimism.

N. T. Wright’s attention to first‑century Jewish idiom aids exegesis precisely where the delay bites. By arguing that the sign of the Son of Man is the temple’s fall and that such language functions as a claim about enthronement, Wright helps us see how Jesus’ words were vindicated within a generation. The caution is to secure the universal, visible appearing promised by the apostles so that the hope of the church does not relocate entirely to past judgments or imperial metaphors of enthronement. The creed’s confession that he will come again in glory is not a poetic restatement of seventy but a hope that anchors the church’s grief and frames the resurrection of the dead.

Richard Bauckham’s reading of 2 Peter 3 restores God’s character to the center of the delay question. Delay is not explained by miscalculation but by mission and mercy. God stretches the church age to call the nations while promising that the day will come like a thief. The practical implication is twofold. First, the delay is not indefinite in the sense of aimless extension. It is indefinite in date yet definite in purpose. Second, the moral weight falls on holy conduct and godliness, waiting and hastening the day through faithful witness. The church hastens not by forcing God’s hand but by participating in the very mission for which he lengthens the time. Examiner challenge: does hastening imply contingency in the divine plan. Response: the language teaches that God’s decree includes the prayers and evangelism of the saints as means toward the day he has fixed. There is no conflict between divine sovereignty and genuine creaturely agency.

Two adjacent loci illuminate the coherence further. First, the doctrine of Scripture. If the New Testament authors and Jesus erred about the timing of the end, inerrancy collapses. The inaugurated account protects inerrancy by reading texts according to their genre and intertextual grammar rather than imposing a modern chronological literalism on prophetic speech. The truthfulness of Scripture is not secured by retreat into vagueness but by this disciplined reading. Second, Christology. If Jesus erred, he is not the faithful prophet. Yet Jesus did not speak to satisfy curiosity but to summon watchfulness. He expressly denied that his disciples could know the day or hour. He spoke authoritatively about near judgments and ultimate hope, locating both under the Father’s authority. His prophetic office is thereby vindicated by the fall of Jerusalem and sustained by the Spirit’s witness to his promise.

One more practical pressure point remains. Does teaching indefinite delay tempt the church to complacency. The answer is that the New Testament refuses to make imminence a function of calendar certainty. Imminence is ethical nearness. It is the urgent claim of the Lord upon his people now. The vice that accompanies failed date setting is matched by the vice that accompanies delay without watchfulness. The only antidote is to recover the telic structure of Christian existence. The church lives from the future. She prays for the day, she measures her life by that day, and she interprets suffering as birth pangs toward that day. The Supper concludes with a promise to drink new in the kingdom. That promise in every celebration is the liturgical answer to delay. It is the pledge that waiting is not empty but filled with the presence of the risen Lord.

What then is the thesis to defend. The Parousia is both imminent and indefinite by divine design. Imminence is a function of the **already and not yet**. The decisive events have occurred, the Spirit has been given, the Judge is at the door. Indefiniteness is a function of divine lordship over time and the moral character of patience. Jesus spoke with prophetic perspective, binding near judgment and final appearing with shared imagery. The apostles developed this with consistency, grounding delay in **divine patience** ordered to repentance, in the mission to the nations, and in the sanctification of the church. Against Schweitzer, there is no failed countdown; against Dodd, there is no reduction of the future horizon. The delay is not a loophole but an ordained epoch for gathering the elect, forming a holy people, and magnifying the glory of Christ before the world. Far from weakening hope, this account intensifies watchfulness, purifies expectations, and secures confidence that the same Christ who came will come again.
