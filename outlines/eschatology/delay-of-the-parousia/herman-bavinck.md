# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck addressed the **delay of the Parousia** within the broader framework of **Reformed eschatology**, emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the certainty of Christ’s return. He argued that the apparent postponement of the **Second Coming** is not a failure of divine promise but reflects God’s sovereign purpose in the unfolding of **salvation history** and the gathering of the **church** from all nations.

- "The delay of the parousia is not a postponement but the period in which the gospel is preached to all nations and the church is gathered." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)
