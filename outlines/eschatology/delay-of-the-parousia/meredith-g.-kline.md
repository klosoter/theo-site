# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the **delay of the Parousia** through the lens of **biblical theology**, emphasizing the **covenantal structure** of redemptive history and the **already/not yet** tension of the **kingdom of God**. He argued that the apparent delay is integral to the outworking of God's **eschatological purposes**, as the **intrusion of the age to come** into the present era anticipates but does not exhaust the final consummation.

- "The interim period is not a postponement of the kingdom but the arena of its progressive realization in the midst of the old order." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - The kingdom is inaugurated but not yet consummated in Christ's first coming.
    - The delay of the Parousia allows for the ongoing realization of redemptive promises.
    - The church lives in the tension between fulfillment and expectation.
    - This framework explains the coexistence of blessing and suffering in the present age.
    - "The new creation has been inaugurated, but its fullness awaits the Parousia." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenantal Structure of History**
    - History unfolds through successive divine covenants, each advancing God's redemptive plan.
    - The delay is a function of the outworking of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The church's mission is shaped by its covenantal identity in the interim.
    - The Parousia marks the final ratification of the covenant.
    - "The covenantal program of God moves inexorably toward consummation, though not according to human timetables." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

3. **Intrusion Ethics**
    - The intrusion of final judgment and blessing into history prefigures the Parousia.
    - Old Testament events (e.g., the flood, conquest) are anticipatory intrusions of the end.
    - The delay allows for the coexistence of common grace and intrusion judgments.
    - This concept guards against over-realized eschatology.
    - "Intrusions of the age to come serve as signs and pledges of the final Parousia." (Images of the Spirit)

4. **Typology and Symbolism**
    - Typological patterns in Scripture foreshadow the Parousia and its delay.
    - The temple, Sabbath, and promised land are types pointing to eschatological fulfillment.
    - The delay is prefigured in the wilderness wanderings and exile motifs.
    - Typology underscores the unity of redemptive history.
    - "Typology is the divinely ordained correspondence between the two stages of the kingdom." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Divine Sovereignty and Patience**
    - The delay is an expression of God's sovereign patience and purpose.
    - God withholds final judgment to allow for repentance and the gathering of the elect.
    - The timing of the Parousia is hidden in the counsel of God.
    - Human speculation about the timing is rebuked by the biblical witness.
    - "The Lord of the covenant is not slow as some count slowness, but is patient toward you." (Structure of Biblical Authority)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline's articulation of the **already/not yet** framework has deeply influenced Reformed biblical theology, especially regarding eschatology and the delay of the Parousia. His emphasis on **covenantal structure** and **intrusion ethics** provided a robust theological rationale for understanding the present age in light of Christ's return. Kline's work continues to shape discussions on the relationship between redemptive history and eschatological hope within confessional Reformed circles.
