# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame addresses the **delay of the Parousia** within his broader commitment to **Reformed eschatology** and the **Lordship of Christ** over history. He emphasizes the **sovereignty of God** in determining the timing of Christ’s return, interpreting the perceived delay as purposeful within God’s redemptive plan and as a call for the church’s ongoing faithfulness and mission.

- "God’s timing is always perfect, and the apparent delay of Christ’s return is an expression of his patience and mercy toward his people." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2013)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty Over History**
    - The timing of the **Parousia** is determined solely by God’s will.
    - Human speculation about the date is both futile and contrary to biblical teaching.
    - The delay serves God’s purposes in redemption and judgment.
    - History unfolds according to God’s comprehensive plan.
    - "God’s lordship means that he alone determines when Christ will return." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective**
    - The delay is integral to the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - God uses the intervening period to gather the elect from all nations.
    - The church’s mission is framed by the expectation of Christ’s return.
    - The delay is not a failure but a feature of God’s covenantal faithfulness.
    - "The so-called delay is part of God’s redemptive program, not a mistake or oversight." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Pastoral and Ethical Implications**
    - The delay calls believers to perseverance and holiness.
    - Christians are to live in constant readiness for Christ’s return.
    - The church’s ethical life is shaped by eschatological hope.
    - The delay provides opportunity for repentance and evangelism.
    - "The church is called to faithfulness in the present, precisely because the timing of the end is unknown." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Christ’s Lordship and Presence**
    - Christ remains present with his people even during the delay.
    - The **already/not yet** tension defines the church’s experience.
    - The delay does not diminish Christ’s authority or reign.
    - The Spirit mediates Christ’s presence until the Parousia.
    - "Jesus is truly with us now, even as we await his visible return." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Biblical Interpretation and Prophecy**
    - Prophetic passages must be interpreted with humility and caution.
    - Apparent “delays” are often due to misunderstanding prophetic language.
    - The New Testament teaches both imminence and delay.
    - The church must avoid speculative eschatology.
    - "Scripture teaches us to be watchful, not to set dates or grow impatient." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s approach to the **delay of the Parousia** has reinforced a robustly **Reformed eschatology** that integrates doctrinal fidelity with practical living. His emphasis on the sovereignty of God and the ongoing mission of the church has shaped contemporary evangelical thought, especially within confessional Reformed circles. Frame’s work continues to encourage a posture of hopeful expectancy, grounded in the lordship of Christ and the trustworthiness of God’s promises.
