# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas addressed the **delay of the Parousia** within his broader eschatological framework, emphasizing the **sovereignty of God** over the timing of **Christ’s Second Coming**. He argued that the apparent delay serves the purposes of **divine providence**, allowing for the fulfillment of the **predestined number of the elect** and the unfolding of **salvation history**.

- "The reason why the time of the coming judgment is hidden from us is that men may be on the watch and keep themselves ever prepared for it." (Summa Theologiae, III, q.59, a.5, ad 3)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially Supplementum, q.73–90
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, ch. 92–97
- Commentary on 1 Thessalonians (notably on 1 Thess 4–5)
- Catena Aurea (commentary on Gospel passages concerning the Parousia)
- De Veritate, q. 18, a. 8

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Providence Governs the Parousia**
    - The timing of the **Second Coming** is determined solely by **God’s providence**.
    - Human speculation about the date is both futile and presumptuous.
    - The delay is not arbitrary but serves the unfolding of **God’s salvific plan**.
    - The hiddenness of the time encourages vigilance and moral readiness.
    - "It is not for you to know the times or moments, which the Father hath put in his own power." (Summa Theologiae, III, q.59, a.5, ad 3)

2. **Fulfillment of the Number of the Elect**
    - The Parousia is delayed until the **full number of the elect** have come to faith.
    - God’s mercy allows time for repentance and conversion.
    - The delay demonstrates God’s patience and desire for the salvation of many.
    - The Church’s mission continues until the appointed time is fulfilled.
    - "The Lord does not delay his promise, but is patient for your sake, not wishing that any should perish." (Commentary on 2 Peter 3:9)

3. **Integration with Salvation History**
    - The delay fits within the broader narrative of **redemptive history**.
    - It allows for the progressive revelation of God’s purposes.
    - The unfolding of history is meaningful and directed toward a final consummation.
    - The Parousia will occur at the divinely appointed climax of history.
    - "The end of the world will not come until the Gospel has been preached to all nations." (Summa Theologiae, Supplementum, q.73, a.1)

4. **Moral and Spiritual Preparation**
    - The uncertainty of the timing is intended to foster continual **watchfulness**.
    - Believers are exhorted to live in a state of readiness and holiness.
    - The delay is a test of faith and perseverance for the Church.
    - The expectation of Christ’s return shapes Christian ethics and hope.
    - "Watch ye therefore, because you know not what hour your Lord will come." (Catena Aurea, Matthew 24:42)

5. **Rejection of Date-Setting**
    - Aquinas explicitly rejects attempts to calculate the date of the Parousia.
    - He views such speculation as contrary to Christ’s own teaching.
    - The mystery of the timing is part of God’s inscrutable wisdom.
    - Faithful obedience is prioritized over curiosity about eschatological details.
    - "It is not for us to know the times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority." (Summa Contra Gentiles, IV, ch.97)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s approach to the **delay of the Parousia** shaped subsequent Catholic and broader Christian eschatology, emphasizing the interplay of **divine providence** and human responsibility. His insistence on vigilance and the futility of date-setting became standard in later theological reflection. By rooting the delay in the purposes of God and the fulfillment of the elect, Aquinas provided a framework that balanced hope with patience, influencing both medieval and modern discussions of **eschatology**.
