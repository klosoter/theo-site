# C.H. Dodd (1884–1973)

C.H. Dodd was a leading proponent of **realized eschatology**, arguing that the New Testament's expectation of the **Parousia** is best understood as the fulfillment of God's promises in the ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus, rather than as a postponed future event. He contended that the **delay of the Parousia** reflects a shift in early Christian thought from imminent expectation to an emphasis on the present reality of the **Kingdom of God**.

- "The eschaton has moved from the future into the present, from the sphere of expectation into that of realized experience." ("The Parables of the Kingdom")

## Key Works

- The Parables of the Kingdom (1935)
- The Apostolic Preaching and Its Developments (1936)
- The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel (1953)
- New Testament Eschatology and the Problem of its Reception (in various essays)
- History and the Gospel (1938)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Realized Eschatology**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is primarily a present reality inaugurated by Jesus.
    - Eschatological language in the New Testament refers to current spiritual experience, not just future hope.
    - The focus shifts from expectation of a future event to the transformation already begun in Christ.
    - The **delay of the Parousia** is resolved by reinterpreting eschatological promises as fulfilled.
    - "The teaching of Jesus is dominated throughout by one theme: the Kingdom of God has come."

2. **Reinterpretation of Parousia**
    - Early Christian expectation of an imminent return was re-evaluated as time passed.
    - The **Parousia** is seen less as a literal future event and more as a metaphor for Christ's ongoing presence.
    - The church adapted its theology to emphasize the significance of Christ's resurrection and the Spirit.
    - The delay prompted a theological shift from apocalyptic to existential categories.
    - "The early Church, faced with the delay of the Parousia, found in the resurrection the true coming of the Lord."

3. **Demythologizing Apocalyptic Expectation**
    - Apocalyptic imagery is interpreted symbolically rather than literally.
    - The urgency of early Christian proclamation is retained, but its temporal framework is redefined.
    - The **eschatological crisis** is internalized as a present spiritual reality.
    - The New Testament's apocalyptic language is a vehicle for existential truth.
    - "The apocalyptic language is the clothing of a profound spiritual experience."

4. **Centrality of Christ’s Resurrection**
    - The resurrection is the decisive eschatological event for the early church.
    - It marks the beginning of the new age and fulfills Old Testament promises.
    - The resurrection reorients hope from a postponed future to present transformation.
    - The **delay of the Parousia** is theologically resolved in the resurrection event.
    - "For the primitive Church, the resurrection of Christ was itself the Parousia in the deepest sense."

5. **Ethical Implications of Realized Eschatology**
    - The present reality of the Kingdom calls for immediate ethical response.
    - Christian life is lived in the tension between the 'already' and the 'not yet.'
    - The delay of the Parousia motivates ongoing mission and moral transformation.
    - The church embodies the Kingdom in the world now, not merely awaiting a future consummation.
    - "The Kingdom is not only a hope; it is a present fact, demanding present response."

## Legacy and Impact

Dodd’s **realized eschatology** profoundly influenced twentieth-century New Testament scholarship, shifting the focus from future apocalyptic expectation to the present reality of salvation in Christ. His interpretation of the **delay of the Parousia** challenged traditional readings and paved the way for existential and demythologizing approaches, notably influencing Rudolf Bultmann. Dodd’s work continues to shape discussions on the nature of **eschatology**, the interpretation of biblical apocalyptic, and the ethical demands of the gospel.
