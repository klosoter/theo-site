# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the **delay of the Parousia** by integrating it into his broader theology of **eschatology** and **revelation**, emphasizing the existential and historical dimensions of Christian hope. He argued that the **Parousia** should not be understood as a postponed event but as a reality already inaugurated in history, with the Church living in the tension between the "already" and the "not yet" of **salvation history**.

- "The expectation of the Parousia is not a matter of calculating dates, but of living in the openness of faith to the coming Lord." ("Theological Investigations," Vol. 10)

## Key Works

- "Theological Investigations," especially Volumes 9 and 10
- "Foundations of Christian Faith"
- "Eschatology: Death and Eternal Life"
- "The Christian of the Future"
- "Theological Investigations," Volume 4

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Existential Reality**
    - The **Parousia** is not merely a future event but an existential dimension of Christian life.
    - Believers are called to live in the tension of the "already" and "not yet."
    - The delay is not a failure but an invitation to deeper faith and hope.
    - The Church embodies the ongoing presence of Christ in history.
    - "The eschaton is not simply postponed; it is already present in mystery." ("Theological Investigations," Vol. 10)

2. **Revelation in History**
    - **Revelation** unfolds within the historical process, not as a single, isolated event.
    - The delay of the Parousia highlights the ongoing nature of God's self-communication.
    - History is the medium through which God’s promises are realized.
    - The Church is the sacrament of this ongoing revelation.
    - "God's self-communication is not bound to a timetable but unfolds in the freedom of history." ("Foundations of Christian Faith")

3. **Christology and the Parousia**
    - The **Parousia** is inseparable from the mystery of Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection.
    - The risen Christ is already present, though not yet fully revealed.
    - The delay emphasizes the hiddenness and universality of Christ’s lordship.
    - The Church participates in the ongoing manifestation of Christ’s presence.
    - "The coming of Christ is both an event of the past and a reality of the future." ("Eschatology: Death and Eternal Life")

4. **Anthropology and Hope**
    - Human existence is marked by openness to the future and the ultimate fulfillment in God.
    - The delay of the Parousia shapes Christian hope as a dynamic, forward-looking reality.
    - Hope is grounded in the promise of God, not in chronological predictions.
    - The believer’s life is oriented toward the ultimate encounter with God.
    - "Christian hope is not frustrated by delay, but purified and deepened." ("Theological Investigations," Vol. 9)

5. **Ecclesiology and Mission**
    - The Church lives in the interim period as the sign and instrument of the coming Kingdom.
    - The delay of the Parousia gives urgency and meaning to the Church’s mission.
    - The Church’s sacramental life anticipates and participates in the final consummation.
    - The community of believers is called to witness to the hope of the Parousia in the world.
    - "The Church is the place where the future of God breaks into the present." ("The Christian of the Future")

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s interpretation of the **delay of the Parousia** has profoundly influenced modern Catholic **eschatology**, shifting the focus from speculative chronology to existential and historical engagement. His theology encouraged the Church to see itself as living in the tension of the **already/not yet**, emphasizing mission and hope rather than disappointment or anxiety over delay. Rahner’s insights continue to shape contemporary discussions on the meaning of Christian expectation and the role of the Church in history.
