# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin addressed the **delay of the Parousia** within the broader framework of **eschatology**, emphasizing the sovereignty of God in determining the timing of **Christ’s second coming**. He rejected speculative attempts to predict the Parousia, insisting that the apparent delay serves the purposes of **divine providence**, the gathering of the **elect**, and the fulfillment of **redemptive history** according to Scripture.

- "The time of the second coming is purposely hidden from us, that we may be always watchful and prepared." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially vol. 3, topics on eschatology)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Commentarius in Epistolam ad Romanos
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Sovereignty over the Parousia**
    - God alone determines the timing of Christ’s return.
    - Human speculation about the date is both futile and presumptuous.
    - The delay is not a sign of divine slackness but of purposeful governance.
    - The Parousia will occur at the divinely appointed moment, unknown to all creatures.
    - "The Father has reserved the knowledge of that day to himself, that men may not be curious." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

2. **Purposeful Delay for the Gathering of the Elect**
    - The delay allows for the full number of the elect to be brought to salvation.
    - God’s patience is directed toward the repentance and faith of His people.
    - The gospel must be preached to all nations before the end comes.
    - The delay is a manifestation of divine mercy, not neglect.
    - "He delays that he may gather all his elect and that none of them may perish." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Fulfillment**
    - The Parousia is the climax of redemptive history.
    - All Old and New Testament prophecies must be fulfilled before Christ’s return.
    - The delay ensures the completion of God’s redemptive purposes in history.
    - The church’s mission is integrally tied to the timing of the end.
    - "The end will not come until all things foretold by the prophets are accomplished." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

4. **Call to Watchfulness and Readiness**
    - The uncertainty of the timing is meant to foster continual vigilance.
    - Believers are exhorted to live in a state of spiritual preparedness.
    - The delay tests and refines the faith of the church.
    - Watchfulness is a mark of true Christian discipleship in the present age.
    - "Since we know not the hour, we must always be ready." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

5. **Rejection of Millenarian Speculation**
    - Turretin opposes chiliastic or millenarian predictions regarding the Parousia.
    - He affirms the Reformed amillennial understanding of the end times.
    - The focus is on Christ’s final coming, not on earthly expectations of a temporal kingdom.
    - Speculation about the delay undermines trust in God’s revealed will.
    - "We ought not to be wise above what is written, nor to fix times which God has concealed." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful articulation of the **delay of the Parousia** shaped subsequent Reformed eschatology, reinforcing the importance of **divine sovereignty** and the futility of human speculation. His emphasis on watchfulness and the gathering of the elect provided a theological rationale for patience and perseverance in the church. Turretin’s approach continues to inform confessional Reformed theology, especially in its resistance to date-setting and its focus on the fulfillment of God’s redemptive purposes.
