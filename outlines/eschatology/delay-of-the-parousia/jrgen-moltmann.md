# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets the **delay of the Parousia** through the lens of **eschatological hope** and the **theology of the cross**, emphasizing the ongoing tension between the **already** and the **not yet** of God's kingdom. He views the delay not as a failure but as a space for **Christian mission**, solidarity with suffering, and the transformation of history in anticipation of Christ’s return.

- "Christianity is eschatology, is hope, forward looking and forward moving, and therefore also revolutionizing and transforming the present." ("Theology of Hope")

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- Jesus Christ for Today’s World (1994)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as the Center of Christian Theology**
    - Eschatology is not a peripheral doctrine but the driving force of Christian faith.
    - The delay of the Parousia shapes the church’s orientation toward the future.
    - Hope in the coming kingdom energizes ethical and social engagement.
    - The future of Christ determines the meaning of history and present existence.
    - "From first to last, and not merely in the epilogue, Christianity is eschatology." ("Theology of Hope")

2. **The Already and the Not Yet**
    - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - The delay is intrinsic to the tension between present reality and promised fulfillment.
    - Believers live in anticipation, embodying hope amid incompleteness.
    - The church is called to witness to the coming reality in the present.
    - "The resurrection hope makes the church a provisional, forward-moving community." ("Theology of Hope")

3. **Redemptive Purpose in Delay**
    - The delay of the Parousia is purposeful, allowing for the transformation of the world.
    - It creates space for repentance, reconciliation, and mission.
    - Suffering and struggle are not meaningless but participate in God’s redemptive plan.
    - The church is empowered to act as an agent of renewal in history.
    - "The time of the church is the time of patient expectation and active hope." ("The Coming of God")

4. **Solidarity with Suffering in the Interim**
    - The delay calls Christians to solidarity with the suffering and oppressed.
    - The crucified Christ is present with humanity in its pain during the waiting.
    - Hope is sustained through participation in Christ’s suffering and resurrection.
    - The church’s mission is shaped by compassion and justice.
    - "God weeps with us so that we may someday laugh with him." ("The Crucified God")

5. **Critique of Apocalyptic Passivity**
    - Moltmann rejects resignation or escapism in response to the delay.
    - The church is not to withdraw but to engage the world with transformative hope.
    - Apocalyptic expectation should inspire ethical responsibility, not passivity.
    - The delay is an invitation to active anticipation, not despair.
    - "Hope’s statements of promise anticipate the future of reality, and change the present." ("Theology of Hope")

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s interpretation of the **delay of the Parousia** has profoundly shaped modern **eschatological theology**, reframing the waiting period as a time for active hope and engagement rather than disappointment or passivity. His emphasis on the theology of hope and the transformative potential of the church in history has influenced both academic theology and practical ministry. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire movements for justice, reconciliation, and mission, making eschatology a dynamic force in contemporary Christian thought.
