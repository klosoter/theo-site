# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl approached the **delay of the Parousia** by reinterpreting traditional eschatological expectations through the lens of the **Kingdom of God** as a present ethical reality rather than a future apocalyptic event. He emphasized the significance of **historical development** and the **community of believers** in realizing Christ’s work, downplaying speculative focus on the timing of Christ’s return. For Ritschl, the meaning of **eschatology** was to be found in the ongoing moral transformation of society rather than in literal fulfillment of prophetic chronology.

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s reinterpretation of the **delay of the Parousia** profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, shifting focus from speculative eschatology to the ethical and communal dimensions of Christian faith. His emphasis on the **Kingdom of God** as a present reality shaped later liberal theology and contributed to the development of the **Social Gospel** movement. While his views were criticized by more traditional theologians, Ritschl’s legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the relationship between eschatology, history, and ethics.
