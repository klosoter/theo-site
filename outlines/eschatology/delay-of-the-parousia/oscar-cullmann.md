# Oscar Cullmann (1902–1999)

Oscar Cullmann was a leading twentieth-century New Testament scholar who interpreted the **delay of the Parousia** through the lens of **salvation history**. He argued that the early church’s experience of the postponed return of Christ was not a theological crisis but a vital period within the **already/not yet** tension of **redemptive history**, emphasizing the ongoing work of the church in the interim.

- "The time between the resurrection and the Parousia is not an empty interval, but a period of salvation history with its own significance." ("Christ and Time")

## Key Works

- "Christ and Time: The Primitive Christian Conception of Time and History"
- "The Christology of the New Testament"
- "Salvation in History"
- "Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Salvation History as Framework**
    - Interprets the New Testament within the unfolding of **Heilsgeschichte** (salvation history).
    - Sees the delay of the Parousia as a meaningful phase, not a theological embarrassment.
    - Emphasizes the linear progression of redemptive events.
    - Contrasts Christian historical consciousness with cyclical pagan views.
    - "Primitive Christianity is essentially a religion of history." ("Christ and Time")

2. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - Stresses the inaugurated but incomplete nature of the **Kingdom of God**.
    - The resurrection marks the decisive victory, but consummation awaits the Parousia.
    - The church lives in the tension between fulfillment and expectation.
    - The delay is intrinsic to the structure of Christian hope.
    - "The time between D-Day and V-Day is the time of the church." ("Christ and Time")

3. **Significance of the Present Age**
    - The interim is a period of active mission and witness.
    - The church participates in the ongoing work of Christ.
    - Ethical responsibility is heightened by the anticipation of Christ’s return.
    - The delay allows for the gathering of the elect and the spread of the gospel.
    - "The present time is not a mere waiting period, but a time of decisive action." ("Christ and Time")

4. **Rejection of Imminent Expectation Crisis**
    - Argues that the early church adapted to the delay without abandoning faith.
    - New Testament writings reflect a developing, not collapsing, eschatological hope.
    - Theological reflection on the delay led to deeper understanding of Christ’s work.
    - The delay is not a failure but a divinely purposed interval.
    - "The expectation of the Parousia was not disappointed, but reinterpreted in light of salvation history." ("Christ and Time")

5. **Christ as the Center of Time**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the turning point of history.
    - All time is oriented around the events of Christ’s first and second comings.
    - The Parousia is the goal toward which history moves.
    - The delay underscores the centrality of Christ in both past and future.
    - "For the New Testament, Christ is the midpoint of time." ("Christ and Time")

## Legacy and Impact

Cullmann’s approach to the **delay of the Parousia** profoundly shaped twentieth-century biblical theology, especially through his articulation of **salvation history** and the **already/not yet** framework. His work provided a robust alternative to existentialist and purely realized eschatologies, influencing both Protestant and Catholic scholarship. Cullmann’s insights continue to inform discussions on the meaning of Christian hope and the church’s mission in the present age.
