# Richard Bauckham (1946– )

Richard Bauckham approaches the **delay of the Parousia** by emphasizing the **eschatological tension** inherent in early Christian expectation and the **apocalyptic framework** of the New Testament. He argues that the apparent delay is not a failure of prophecy but a feature of the **already/not yet** dynamic of **New Testament eschatology**, particularly as seen in **Revelation** and the Synoptic Gospels.

- "The delay of the Parousia is not a problem to be solved, but a feature of Christian eschatology to be understood." (The Theology of the Book of Revelation)

## Key Works

- The Theology of the Book of Revelation
- Jude and the Relatives of Jesus in the Early Church
- Jesus and the Eyewitnesses (contextualizes eschatological expectation)
- "The Delay of the Parousia" (in J. T. Carroll, ed., The Return of Jesus in Early Christianity)
- "The Eschatological Earthquake in the Apocalypse of John" (Novum Testamentum)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Tension in the New Testament**
    - Early Christians lived in the tension between **imminence** and **delay** regarding Christ’s return.
    - The New Testament reflects both urgent expectation and preparedness for a longer period.
    - This tension is especially evident in **Revelation** and the Synoptic traditions.
    - Bauckham sees this as a deliberate theological stance, not a failed prediction.
    - "The New Testament does not simply predict an imminent Parousia, but holds together imminence and delay." (The Theology of the Book of Revelation)

2. **Apocalyptic Framework Shapes Expectation**
    - The **apocalyptic worldview** frames the Parousia as both imminent and subject to divine sovereignty.
    - Apocalyptic literature often uses **symbolic language** to express hope and patience.
    - The delay is interpreted as part of God’s redemptive plan, not as a crisis.
    - Bauckham highlights the function of apocalyptic imagery in sustaining faith during waiting.
    - "Apocalyptic literature is designed to sustain hope in the face of delay." (The Theology of the Book of Revelation)

3. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated but not consummated, explaining the delay.
    - Early Christians understood themselves as living in the overlap of the ages.
    - The delay allows for the ongoing mission and repentance.
    - This framework prevents despair or disillusionment over the Parousia’s timing.
    - "The delay is intrinsic to the already/not yet structure of Christian eschatology." (The Theology of the Book of Revelation)

4. **Theological Purpose of Delay**
    - The delay serves a **missional** and **pastoral** function in the church.
    - It provides time for repentance and the gathering of the elect.
    - The church is called to faithful witness during the period of waiting.
    - Bauckham connects the delay to God’s patience and mercy.
    - "The delay of the Parousia is an expression of God’s patience, not his failure." (The Theology of the Book of Revelation)

5. **Revelation as Paradigm for Eschatological Waiting**
    - The Book of Revelation models how the church should live in light of the delay.
    - It encourages perseverance, worship, and hope amid suffering.
    - Revelation’s visions are meant to orient believers toward ultimate fulfillment.
    - Bauckham sees Revelation as the New Testament’s most developed theology of the delay.
    - "Revelation is the New Testament’s classic statement of the theology of waiting." (The Theology of the Book of Revelation)

## Legacy and Impact

Bauckham’s work has significantly shaped contemporary understanding of the **delay of the Parousia** by reframing it within the **apocalyptic and eschatological** context of the New Testament. His insights have influenced both scholarly and pastoral approaches to Christian hope and expectation. By emphasizing the theological purpose of delay, Bauckham has helped move the discussion beyond apologetic concerns to a richer appreciation of New Testament eschatology. His contributions continue to inform debates on the nature of **Christian eschatological hope** and the interpretation of apocalyptic literature.
