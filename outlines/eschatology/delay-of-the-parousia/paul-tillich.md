# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **delay of the Parousia** through the lens of his existential and ontological theology, interpreting **eschatology** as a symbol of the ongoing tension between the **"already" and "not yet"** in history. Rather than viewing the Parousia as a literal, future event, Tillich emphasized its significance as a symbol of the **ultimate fulfillment** and **transformation** of existence within the **kairos** of God's self-disclosure.

- "The expectation of the end is the expectation of the ultimate meaning of history, not of its chronological end." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Symbolic**
    - The **Parousia** is not a literal event but a symbol for the ultimate meaning and fulfillment of history.
    - Eschatological language expresses existential hope rather than chronological prediction.
    - The "end" is understood as the **telos** or ultimate purpose, not a temporal conclusion.
    - The delay of the Parousia highlights the symbolic nature of Christian expectation.
    - "The symbols of end and fulfillment are not predictions but expressions of ultimate concern." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Kairos and Historical Fulfillment**
    - **Kairos** represents the decisive moment of God's action in history, not a fixed date.
    - The delay is inherent to the ongoing dialectic of history and revelation.
    - Every moment can become a kairos in which the ultimate breaks into the temporal.
    - The Parousia is always anticipated, never fully realized in history.
    - "Kairos is the moment in which history is invaded by the eternal." (The Interpretation of History)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Expectation**
    - The delay of the Parousia reflects the existential tension of human existence.
    - Expectation is an expression of **ultimate concern** rather than a timetable.
    - The "not yet" sustains hope and openness to the future.
    - The existential attitude is one of waiting, not calculation.
    - "The expectation of the end is the expectation of the fulfillment of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Critique of Literalism**
    - Tillich rejects literal readings of biblical eschatology as mythological.
    - The delay exposes the inadequacy of purely historical or predictive interpretations.
    - Eschatological symbols must be demythologized to reveal their existential meaning.
    - Literalism leads to disappointment and loss of faith in the face of delay.
    - "The mythological expectation of the end must be transformed into existential anticipation." (The Protestant Era)

5. **The Ongoing Presence of Christ**
    - The **Christ event** is the decisive manifestation of the New Being, not a postponed return.
    - The presence of Christ is experienced in the community and in history.
    - The delay of the Parousia points to the continuous work of **reconciliation** and **transformation**.
    - The ultimate is always present as a possibility within the finite.
    - "The Christ is present wherever the New Being is manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich's interpretation of the **delay of the Parousia** shifted the focus of modern theology from literal expectation to existential and symbolic understanding. His approach influenced later **existentialist** and **process theologians**, encouraging a reinterpretation of eschatological hope as an ongoing, transformative reality. By emphasizing the **kairos** and the symbolic nature of Christian expectation, Tillich provided a framework for engaging eschatology in a secular and pluralistic age. His legacy endures in discussions of the meaning of **ultimate fulfillment** and the role of eschatology in contemporary theology.
