# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **final judgment** and **eternal states** within the framework of **Reformed eschatology**, emphasizing the absolute antithesis between the redeemed and the reprobate as the consummation of **redemptive history**. He insisted that the final judgment is the ultimate vindication of God's **covenantal sovereignty** and the definitive revelation of the Creator-creature distinction, culminating in the eternal destinies of heaven and hell as the outworking of God's **self-attesting revelation**.

- "The final judgment is the public manifestation of the absolute difference between those who have built their lives upon the foundation of Christ and those who have not." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Final Judgment as Covenant Consummation**
    - The final judgment is the climax of God's **covenantal dealings** with humanity.
    - It publicly reveals the outcome of the **covenant of grace** and the **covenant of works**.
    - The event is not merely forensic but redemptive-historical, displaying God's faithfulness.
    - Judgment is the vindication of God's justice and mercy in Christ.
    - "The final judgment is the point at which the history of redemption reaches its full disclosure." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Antithesis Between Believer and Unbeliever**
    - The final judgment eternally separates the regenerate from the unregenerate.
    - This antithesis is rooted in the **noetic effects of sin** and the work of the Spirit.
    - The destinies of heaven and hell are the outworking of this fundamental distinction.
    - The judgment exposes the futility of all non-Christian worldviews.
    - "There is no neutral ground at the last day; the antithesis is absolute and final." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Eternal States as Revelation of God’s Character**
    - Heaven and hell are the ultimate expressions of God's **justice** and **grace**.
    - The eternal state of each individual is determined by their relation to Christ.
    - The glory of God is displayed both in the salvation of the elect and the just condemnation of the reprobate.
    - The eternal states are not arbitrary but flow from God's self-consistency.
    - "The eternal destinies of men are the revelation of the character of the triune God." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Self-Attesting Revelation and Eschatological Certainty**
    - The certainty of final judgment and eternal states is grounded in the **self-attesting authority of Scripture**.
    - Human reason cannot autonomously judge or reinterpret eschatological realities.
    - The eschaton is revealed, not discovered, and must be received by faith.
    - Apologetic engagement must presuppose the truth of biblical eschatology.
    - "We know of the final judgment only because God has told us; it is not a matter of speculation but of revelation." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective on Eschatology**
    - The final judgment and eternal states are integral to the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - Eschatology is not a mere appendix but central to the Christian worldview.
    - The consummation is the goal toward which all of history moves under God's providence.
    - The believer's hope in the eternal state shapes present obedience and apologetic witness.
    - "Eschatology is not an afterthought; it is the very telos of the covenantal drama." (Essays on Christian Education)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **final judgment** and **eternal states** has profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and systematic theology, especially through his emphasis on the antithesis and the covenantal structure of redemptive history. His insistence on the self-attesting nature of Scripture as the only sure ground for eschatological certainty has influenced generations of theologians and apologists. By integrating eschatology into the heart of the Christian worldview, Van Til ensured that the doctrines of judgment and eternity remain central to both theological reflection and practical ministry.
