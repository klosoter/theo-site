# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **final judgment** and **eternal states** is foundational for Western Christian theology. He taught that at the end of history, Christ will return to judge all humanity, assigning the righteous to **eternal life** and the wicked to **eternal punishment**. Augustine’s views emphasize the irrevocability of these destinies and the centrality of **divine justice** and **grace** in determining the outcome.

- "The eternal punishment of the lost shall be no less than the eternal happiness of the saved." (The City of God, XXI.23)

## Key Works

- The City of God (especially Books XIX–XXII)
- Enchiridion (Handbook on Faith, Hope, and Love)
- Sermons on the Creed
- Expositions on the Psalms
- Letters (Epistulae), especially those addressing eschatological questions

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Final Judgment is Universal and Definitive**
    - All humans, resurrected bodily, will appear before Christ’s tribunal.
    - Judgment is based on both faith and works, manifesting **divine justice**.
    - The separation of the righteous and wicked is final and irreversible.
    - The event marks the consummation of history and the visible triumph of the **City of God**.
    - "All shall rise, and all shall be judged, so that some may enter into everlasting life, and others into everlasting punishment." (Enchiridion, 111)

2. **Eternal States: Heaven and Hell**
    - The righteous enjoy **eternal life** in perfect fellowship with God.
    - The wicked suffer **eternal punishment**—not annihilation, but conscious separation from God.
    - Both states are unending and correspond to the soul’s ultimate orientation.
    - Augustine rejects the notion of universal salvation or post-mortem repentance.
    - "For the same word 'eternal' is used of both, the punishment of the lost and the life of the saints." (The City of God, XXI.23)

3. **Resurrection of the Body**
    - Both the just and unjust will be raised bodily at the last day.
    - The resurrection body of the righteous is glorified, incorruptible, and suited for eternal communion with God.
    - The wicked also receive a body, but one fitted for enduring punishment.
    - The resurrection affirms the goodness of creation and the holistic nature of salvation or judgment.
    - "The flesh shall rise again, and the very flesh in which each man lived shall be restored to each." (Sermons on the Creed)

4. **Role of Divine Grace in Salvation**
    - Entry into eternal life is ultimately the result of **God’s sovereign grace**.
    - Human merit is insufficient; salvation is a gift, though works bear witness to faith.
    - The elect are preserved by grace, while the reprobate are justly condemned.
    - Augustine’s doctrine combats Pelagianism by emphasizing the necessity of grace for perseverance.
    - "Not by their own merits, but by the grace of God, are the saints predestined to eternal life." (The City of God, XXI.24)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment of the Two Cities**
    - History is a conflict between the **City of God** and the **earthly city**.
    - The final judgment reveals the true character and destiny of each city.
    - The eternal states are the ultimate realization of these two communities.
    - The vision of the **beatific vision** is reserved for the citizens of the City of God.
    - "Two loves have made two cities: love of self, even to contempt of God; love of God, even to contempt of self." (The City of God, XIV.28)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s teaching on the **final judgment** and **eternal states** shaped both medieval and Reformation theology, providing a framework for understanding **heaven**, **hell**, and the consummation of history. His insistence on the eternity of both reward and punishment became standard in Western Christianity. Augustine’s integration of **grace**, **justice**, and eschatology continues to influence theological reflection on the destiny of humanity and the meaning of divine judgment.
