### TITLE
Judgment as Public Truth: The Final Assize, the Beatific Vision, and the Perpetuity of Two Eternal States

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: how the one public **final judgment** consummates God’s purposes in Christ by rendering creatures to their ends in two everlasting states without compromising **divine justice**, **mercy**, or the integrity of the **new creation**.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Jonathan Edwards, Origen.
- Relevant traditions: patristic anti-universalism and exegesis, medieval scholastic accounts of the **beatific vision** and punishment, Reformation and confessional Reformed eschatology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: relation of justification to judgment according to works, degrees of glory and punishment, beatific vision and new-creation embodiment, the nature of time in eternity.
  - External: universalism and apokatastasis, annihilationism and conditional immortality, the justice of eternal punishment, inclusivist soteriology.
  - Contemporary: trauma and restorative justice, theological anthropology and freedom, cosmic scope and environmental eschatology, analytic accounts of eternity.
- Position: I defend a single visible assize at Christ’s return with bodily resurrection of all, judgment according to works that publicly vindicates grace, everlasting communion with God in the **new heavens and new earth** including the **beatific vision**, and everlasting conscious punishment of the wicked with proportionate degrees, rejecting universalism and annihilationism while affirming the pastoral and doxological necessity of this doctrine.

### ESSAY
Final judgment and eternal states name the eschatological event and condition in which God, through the risen Christ, renders public verdict on all rational creatures and assigns them to their ends, confirming the righteous in everlasting life and consigning the impenitent to everlasting punishment. Doctrinally, this locus integrates the divine perfections with Christology, soteriology, and the doctrine of creation. Theologically precise confession requires clarifying the nature of judgment as public truth and rectification, the grounds and logic of judgment according to works within an economy of grace, the metaphysics of resurrected life and retribution, and the finitely knowable shape of eternity under **analogical knowledge**. The defense of a twofold eternal outcome rests on the character of God as just and merciful, the covenantal headship of Adam and Christ, and the revealed telos of the cosmos.

Augustine of Hippo (354–430) framed the western grammar of the last judgment and the two cities with unrivaled depth. In City of God, especially books 19 and 21, Augustine argues that the saeculum is a mixed body marked by pilgrim citizens of the City of God mingled with the earthly city, ordered to divergent ends disclosed on the day when Christ will judge the living and the dead. His method is anti-Manichaean, insisting on the goodness of creation and the justice of God, while rejecting fatalism. Augustine contends that Matthew 25, John 5, and Revelation 20 require the resurrection of both just and unjust to bodily destinies proportioned to their loves. He denies any symmetry between the cities but insists on symmetry of duration: the life and punishment are both called eternal, and it is exegetical special pleading to read one as endless and the other as temporary. Responding to Origenist apokatastasis, Augustine rejects any post-judgment purgation of the damned. Purification belongs to the pilgrim church and, for some, to an intermediate purgatorial process before the last day, but not beyond the public verdict. His anthropology is moral and affective: the will is captivated by its supreme love; hell is not merely privation but the just retribution for disordered love crystallized as character. Augustine’s contribution lies in re-centering eschatology on God’s righteousness rather than on cosmic arithmetic, binding eternal destinies to Christ’s lordship and to the proportional justice of God’s rectifying verdict.

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) codifies metaphysical clarity on the nature of the final judgment and the eternal states. In the Summa Theologiae, especially the Supplement and Prima Pars questions on **divine simplicity** and beatitude, Aquinas synthesizes scriptural judgment with a careful account of creaturely ends. Beatitude consists formally in the **beatific vision**, the immediate intellectual apprehension of the divine essence granted by grace. This vision does not negate the body but perfects embodied persons whose resurrected life is integrated, social, and luminous. Aquinas distinguishes the visio as the formal cause of glory from the accidental joys of the renewed creation and communion of saints. This resolves a perceived tension between contemplative heaven and the biblical picture of a renewed earth: the vision is the highest act of the soul and the wellspring of all other perfected acts in the cosmos. Regarding punishment, Aquinas argues that the reprobate undergo the pain of loss, the privation of God, and the pain of sense, proportionate to their deeds. He defends perpetual punishment by grounding it in the perpetuity of the will’s evil habitus at death, fixed by its last end. This is not a metaphysical necessity that overrules God’s mercy, but a moral truth: the grace that heals is freely resisted to the end by some, and the rectitude of divine governance demands publicity and permanence. Further, Aquinas’s metaphysics of eternity clarifies creaturely mode: glorified creatures are not timeless as God is but are gathered into aeviternity, a mode of stable life with succession only in operations, not in decay. This allows for growth in accidental joy without imperfection in the essential possession of God. Aquinas also articulates degrees of glory and punishment, rooted in differences in charity and malice, so that God’s justice is not indifferent but carefully proportioned.

These two decisive figures set the deep grammar of judgment and eternal states. Augustine anchors the two cities and public verdict in the biblical drama of love and lordship. Aquinas integrates this drama into a metaphysics that defends the **beatific vision**, the resurrected body, and the proportionality of retribution under **divine simplicity** and justice. Their convergence allows Reformed theology to inherit both biblical urgency and metaphysical coherence while reforming according to Scripture.

John Calvin (1509–1564) consolidates a Protestant account that is at once Augustinian in soteriology and ecclesial in pastoral application. In the Institutes and sermons on the Decalogue and the Gospels, Calvin emphasizes that the Christ who justifies will return to judge, thus binding assurance not to escapism but to union with the Judge. Calvin denies psychopannychia and insists the intermediate state is blessed for the faithful, but he reserves the consummation of all hope and terror for the last day when the one public assize will render a definitive verdict. Calvin’s tight Christocentric framing is crucial: salvation and judgment are not two acts by different gods but one act of Christ’s royal priesthood. The forensic logic of justification by faith alone raises an apparent internal tension with judgment according to works. Calvin resolves it by distinguishing the ground and the evidence. The sole ground of acquittal is Christ’s righteousness imputed; works are the Spirit’s fruits that publicly manifest that union. Final judgment thus vindicates God’s grace and reveals the truth of persons before the world. Calvin follows Scripture in affirming degrees of reward and punishment and places weight on the doxological end: God will be all in all, and the saints will enjoy God by the Spirit in the world renewed. He avoids speculative details yet rejects universalism as incompatible with Christ’s explicit words about destruction and with justice rightly understood.

Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758) renders the existential and aesthetic contours of heaven and hell with unparalleled intensity. In sermons such as The Justice of God in the Damnation of Sinners and Discourses on Heaven, Edwards defends eternal conscious punishment by arguing that the gravity of sin corresponds to the majesty of the offended God. Sin is not a discrete event but a standing opposition to infinite excellence, and the obstinacy of the unregenerate will is neither coerced nor excusable. Edwards integrates this with a high view of God’s ends. God’s ultimate end is the communication of his own glory; heaven is not static but an ever-rising tide of joy as the saints behold more of God’s beauty and, in seeing, love more, in loving, see more. Edwards’s dynamic eternity aligns with Aquinas at the core, the **beatific vision**, while accenting the expansion of accidental glory through ever new displays of divine wisdom in the communion of saints and the exploration of the new creation. His account of hell likewise includes a moral and psychological analysis: the damned hate God and one another, their identities curving in on themselves. The punishment is not only externally imposed but internally fitting to the condition of the soul. Edwards thus answers the objection that eternal punishment is arbitrary by arguing that it is narratively and morally coherent.

Origen of Alexandria (184–253) represents the decisive alternative that continues to animate contemporary challenges. In On First Principles, Origen reads the biblical fire and judgment through a universalist lens, arguing for apokatastasis, a final restoration of all rational creatures after purifying chastisements. His method is profoundly allegorical, moving from literal to spiritual sense where literal exegesis appears unworthy of God’s goodness. He frames divine punishment as therapeutic and temporal, designed to heal rather than to retribute. Origen’s conceptual contribution includes a cosmology of multiple aeons and free rational souls falling and being restored, all subordinated to the eventual reconciliation of all to God. While later condemnations targeted Origenism rather than Origen in every detail, his universalist trajectory was judged incompatible with apostolic teaching that posits an irreversible judgment. Origen sets the terms for all subsequent universalist hopes, from Gregory of Nyssa’s disputed passages to modern arguments for restorative eschatology. Engaging Origen forces precision on the nature of divine justice and the exegesis of texts about eternal fire and death.

The internal debates within the classical Augustinian and Reformed trajectories concern the relation of justification and judgment, the degrees and basis of reward and punishment, and the structure of the saints’ final state. The charge is frequently that judgment according to works compromises sola fide. But Scripture insists on both, and the distinction of ground and evidence, already evident in Calvin and sharpened in Reformed scholastics, protects the glory of Christ’s righteousness while honoring the juridical publicity of God’s verdict. Another internal debate involves the **beatific vision** and the new-creation motif. Some Protestants fear the vision as medieval intellectualism, but both Augustine and Aquinas, followed by Edwards, present the vision as the formal perfection of human nature perfected by grace, integrating rather than displacing embodied flourishing. The biblical promise that we shall see him as he is unites with the promise of a renewed earth where nations bring their glory; the vision orders all creaturely delights to God and secures the integration of worship, work, and love. A final internal question concerns temporality in eternity. Aquinas’s doctrine of aeviternity offers a mediating account: creatures possess stable life without decay yet engage in successive acts of praise and discovery. This resists both crude timelessness and endless boredom.

External challenges include universalism, annihilationism, and moral objections to eternal punishment. Universalism appeals to the universality texts and the moral intuition that God’s victory requires universal restoration. Origen’s exegesis and method press us to ask whether the evangelical pair of eternal life and punishment can be asymmetrical in duration. Augustine replies: the same term eternal modifies both; to spiritualize one and not the other is hermeneutically tendentious. Aquinas adds that the permanence of the will’s final orientation and the need for rectitude in public governance make reversible verdicts incoherent. Annihilationism argues that the wages of sin is death and that life belongs only to the redeemed, with figures like John Stott and Edward Fudge proposing conditional immortality. The most substantial form emphasizes divine mercy and proportionality: ceasing to exist seems proportionate and non-sadistic. The classical reply emphasizes that spiritual death in Scripture is not simple nonexistence but alienation from God under wrath, and that the symbolic language of fire and darkness, when read under **analogical knowledge**, denotes realities more terrible than mere cessation. Moreover, both justice and biblical testimony about degrees of punishment sit uneasily with annihilation, which flattens retribution to a single end. Moral objections insist that infinite punishment for finite sins is unjust. Edwards responds by recalling that the moral value of an act is determined not only by its duration but by the worth of the object offended and the abiding posture of the will; Aquinas adds that the vice of contempt, as a habit, persists. If an examiner presses that eternity of punishment contradicts mercy, Augustine counters that mercy is not owed and that God’s patience in history abundantly displays his will that sinners repent, while the final act of judgment vindicates the oppressed and manifests the holiness that mercy presupposes.

Contemporary debates stress-test these classical claims. Some argue for a restorative model of divine justice against so-called retributive models, appealing to trauma theory and the need for healing. The classical account replies that retribution and restoration are not competitors. The saints’ restoration includes the rectification of wrongs by public truth, which is what a court does. Without a final assize, victims are never publicly vindicated and the world remains morally ambiguous. Others propose hopeful universalism in the line of Hans Urs von Balthasar, claiming that we may hope without asserting that all will be saved. The rejoinder is twofold. Hope cannot target what God has not promised; the warnings of Christ are neither theatrical nor idle. And pastoral practice shaped by such hope dulls the moral seriousness of apostolic preaching. Analytic philosophy raises questions about the experience of eternity, whether endless duration is livable, and whether hell could be self-chosen as C. S. Lewis contends. The best synthesis grants that the wicked’s state is self-willed rebellion that becomes its own prison, yet this does not eliminate the juridical nature of the sentence or its infliction by the righteous Judge. Questions about nonhuman creation are also live: does the final judgment include animals and ecosystems. The prophetic and apostolic witness to cosmic renewal suggests a holistic verdict on the order of creation. Aquinas’s account of accidental glory and Calvin’s emphasis on the renewed world make room for meaningful creaturely life under the saints’ rule, with Christ as head of all things.

Scripture remains the final warrant. John 5 depicts resurrection to life and to judgment under the Son, whose voice summons all from the tombs. Matthew 25 portrays the Son of Man separating sheep and goats in a public session where works reveal identity. Romans 2 speaks of a day when God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus, rewarding those who by perseverance in good work seek glory, honor, and immortality. Revelation 20 to 22 binds the lake of fire and the New Jerusalem to the final verdict, with the nations bringing their honor into the city. The hermeneutical key is Christ’s lordship. The judgment is not an abstract moral calculus but the act of the crucified and risen Judge whose wounds are the pledge of mercy and whose throne is the guarantee of rectitude.

The relation of covenant and judgment must be explicit. Under **federal theology**, Adam’s disobedience brought condemnation to all in him, and Christ’s obedience secures justification and life for all in him. The final judgment publicly discloses this covenantal structure: those united to Christ by faith, whose lives manifest Spirit-wrought obedience, are openly acquitted; those who remain in Adam bear their own sin. This protects against any Pelagian drift in the doctrine of works while explaining the consistent biblical insistence on obedience. It also grounds the public nature of the verdict in ecclesiology. The church’s sacraments are provisional judgments and foretastes. Baptism separates and binds to Christ; the Supper anticipates the marriage feast. Church discipline is a temporal anticipation of the last day, loosing and binding as Christ’s delegated court. The final assize, then, is not a surprise addition but the telos of the church’s moral life and mission.

An examiner will press whether the **beatific vision** is compatible with the New Jerusalem’s civic descriptions. The answer, following Aquinas and Edwards, is that the vision perfects and radiates through the entire creaturely life. Seeing God as he is does not evacuate sociality or culture but secures their right ordering, because all the saints’ activity flows from and returns to the one Good. Another objection concerns God’s immutability and the pathos of judgment. Does God suffer anger eternally. Classical theism replies that **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** deny passions in God in the creaturely sense. Judgment is not emotional volatility in God but the creature’s new relation to the one immutable act of holy love. The damned are related to God’s goodness as wrath because of their sin, while the redeemed are related to that same goodness as bliss. Yet God’s act remains simple; the difference lies in the creature’s moral state and God’s just rectification. A further question concerns infants and the cognitively disabled. Scripture does not index the verdict to cognitive capacity but to federal union and divine mercy. The Reformed tradition entrusts those who die in infancy to God’s electing grace, which is not tied to ordinary means, while resisting novelty that ignores Adamic guilt. The point for the doctrine of judgment is that its justice and mercy are not frustrated by special cases; they reveal the depth of covenantal ordering.

Pastorally, the doctrine shapes preaching, sacramental life, and perseverance. Judgment according to works warns believers against antinomianism and consoles the oppressed with the promise that God will vindicate. The promise of the **new creation** motivates creation care without idolatry and anchors sacrifice in hope. The reality of hell sobers and energizes mission, not as fearmongering but as love for souls. The saints ought to meditate on the **beatific vision** as the heart of blessedness, to orient their loves now to what will be their joy forever. The doctrine also disciplines speculative curiosity. We confess what is revealed and interpret images reverently. Fire, darkness, and gnashing of teeth are **analogical knowledge** that signal realities beyond our ordinary experience. The safest course is to insist that the reality is not less but greater than the sign and to avoid taming the terror and the bliss.

What, finally, of the relation of God’s universal salvific will and the particularity of judgment. Augustine and Aquinas together teach that God truly wills the salvation of all in a preceptive sense and that his mercy overflows. Yet he has willed, for the greater manifestation of the full range of his perfections, that some receive mercy and some justice. The cross itself is both mercy and judgment. The last judgment does not introduce a new logic but consummates that displayed at Calvary, where sin was judged in the flesh and mercy triumphed over wrath for the elect. The eschatological publicness of this judgment ensures that truth, which is the form of all justice, will be visible to creatures: God will be vindicated, the saints glorified, the wicked silenced, the cosmos reordered.

In sum, Augustine supplies the moral and biblical scaffolding of two cities and two destinies; Aquinas gives metaphysical precision to the **beatific vision**, punishment, and eternity; Calvin keeps Christological and soteriological clarity so that judgment according to works vindicates grace; Edwards unfolds the existential weight and aesthetic telos of heaven and the fittingness of hell; Origen presses the church to articulate why universalist hopes fail biblically and theologically. The defended position is that at Christ’s return there will be a single, universal, and public assize. All will rise bodily. The righteous, by grace alone through faith alone in union with Christ, will be openly acquitted and enter everlasting life under the **beatific vision** in the **new heavens and new earth**, enjoying degrees of glory. The wicked, having freely and finally rejected God, will endure everlasting conscious punishment with degrees proportioned to their wickedness. This scheme secures the coherence of **divine simplicity**, justice, and mercy, honors covenantal order, and resolves internal tensions between justification and judgment by distinguishing ground and evidence. It answers external and contemporary challenges by demonstrating that without a final public truth there is neither restoration for the world nor moral seriousness in the gospel, and that God’s victory is not quantitative universalism but qualitative rectitude in which God is all in all.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: the one public **final judgment** by Christ rendering all creatures to their ends, with the bodily **resurrection of the body** of just and unjust, the righteous entering the **beatific vision** in the **new creation**, and the wicked assigned to everlasting conscious punishment with degrees proportioned to their deeds.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: two cities, symmetry of eternal duration, moral psychology of loves, anti-universalist exegesis.
  - Thomas Aquinas: formal beatitude as vision of God, aeviternity, proportional rewards and punishments, permanence of will’s last end.
  - John Calvin: Christ the Judge, judgment according to works as public vindication of grace, pastoral and ecclesial framing, degrees of glory.
  - Jonathan Edwards: aesthetic telos of heaven, dynamic accidental glory, fittingness and justice of hell.
  - Origen: apokatastasis as therapeutic punishment and universal restoration, decisive alternative rejected by classical tradition.
- Debates:
  - Internal: justification and judgment according to works, **beatific vision** with embodied **new creation**, degrees of glory and punishment, temporality of eternity.
  - External: universalism and apokatastasis, annihilationism and conditional immortality, moral objections to eternal punishment, inclusivism.
  - Contemporary: restorative justice models, trauma and moral injury, freedom and self-chosen hell, cosmic scope of judgment, analytic questions of eternity.
- Defended position: one visible assize at Christ’s return, public verdict according to works that evidences union with Christ, everlasting communion with God and everlasting conscious punishment, both with degrees, rejecting universalism and annihilationism while integrating **divine simplicity**, justice, mercy, and **federal theology**.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - How does sola fide cohere with judgment according to works? Ground is Christ’s righteousness; works are evidentiary fruits that publicly vindicate grace.
  - Does the **beatific vision** undermine new-creation embodiment? No, it formally perfects the person and radiates through embodied life.
  - Why deny universalism if God wills all to be saved? Scripture’s warnings and the permanence of the will’s last end show the verdict is irreversible; God’s victory is rectitude, not mere universality.
  - Is eternal punishment proportionate to finite sin? Sin’s demerit scales with God’s infinite worth and the abiding obstinacy of the will.
  - Is hell self-chosen or imposed? Both; the state is self-willed rebellion judicially ratified by the righteous Judge.
