# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **final judgment** and **eternal states** with a strong emphasis on the **sovereignty of God**, the seriousness of **human responsibility**, and the ultimate **revelation of God’s righteousness**. He rejected speculative details about the afterlife, focusing instead on the **biblical witness** to judgment and the hope of **consummation** in Christ. Berkouwer’s theology is marked by a careful avoidance of dogmatic excess and a persistent call to humility before the mystery of God’s final acts.

- "The final judgment is not a threat hanging over the world, but the revelation of the righteousness of God in Christ." (The Return of Christ)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Final Judgment as Revelation of Righteousness**
    - The final judgment is the unveiling of God’s **righteousness** rather than a mere punitive event.
    - It is inseparable from the **work of Christ** and the fulfillment of God’s promises.
    - Judgment is not arbitrary but rooted in God’s **covenantal faithfulness**.
    - The event is both sobering and hopeful, revealing the seriousness of **sin** and the certainty of **redemption**.
    - "Judgment is the revelation of the meaning of history in the light of God’s righteousness." (The Return of Christ)

2. **Eternal States: Heaven and Hell in Biblical Perspective**
    - Berkouwer resists speculative descriptions of **heaven** and **hell**, focusing on their biblical function.
    - He stresses the **reality** of both, but warns against imaginative excess or dogmatic detail.
    - The eternal states are the ultimate outcome of one’s relationship to **Christ**.
    - Both are understood in the context of God’s **justice** and **mercy**.
    - "Scripture does not satisfy our curiosity about the hereafter, but directs us to the seriousness of decision before God." (The Return of Christ)

3. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - The person and work of **Jesus Christ** are central to Berkouwer’s understanding of the end times.
    - The final judgment is the consummation of Christ’s **mediatorial reign**.
    - All hope for the eternal state is grounded in **union with Christ**.
    - Eschatology is not a separate doctrine but integrated with **soteriology** and **Christology**.
    - "The return of Christ is not an appendix to the gospel, but its fulfillment." (The Return of Christ)

4. **Human Responsibility and Divine Sovereignty**
    - Berkouwer maintains the tension between **human responsibility** and **divine sovereignty** in judgment.
    - He rejects both fatalism and Pelagianism, affirming that God’s judgment is just and personal.
    - Human choices have real significance in the light of eternity.
    - The seriousness of judgment calls for humility and repentance.
    - "The seriousness of the final judgment is not diminished by the certainty of grace." (The Return of Christ)

5. **Rejection of Speculation and Emphasis on Mystery**
    - Berkouwer is critical of speculative eschatology and detailed systems about the afterlife.
    - He insists on the **limits of revelation** and the necessity of theological humility.
    - The mystery of the eternal states should lead to worship, not curiosity.
    - The church’s hope is grounded in God’s promises, not human imagination.
    - "The mystery of the future is not a puzzle to be solved, but a promise to be trusted." (The Return of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s approach to **final judgment** and **eternal states** has influenced Reformed eschatology by emphasizing biblical restraint, theological humility, and the centrality of Christ. His insistence on the **sovereignty of God** and the seriousness of human response continues to shape discussions on the doctrine of last things. Berkouwer’s legacy is marked by a refusal to speculate beyond Scripture, encouraging the church to live in hope and reverence before the coming consummation.
