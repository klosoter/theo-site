# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the doctrines of **final judgment** and the **eternal states** through his program of **demythologization**, seeking to reinterpret New Testament eschatology in existential terms. He argued that traditional apocalyptic imagery should be understood as symbolic of the individual's encounter with God in the present, rather than as literal predictions of future events. For Bultmann, the true significance of **judgment** and **eternity** lies in the existential decision each person faces before God.

- "The eschatological event is not a cosmic catastrophe but the eschatological decision that takes place in every moment." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Eschatology**
    - Interprets biblical language of **final judgment** and **eternal life** as mythological expressions.
    - Seeks the existential meaning behind apocalyptic imagery.
    - Rejects a literal, future-oriented understanding of cosmic judgment.
    - Emphasizes the individual's present confrontation with God's call.
    - "Mythological eschatology must be replaced by an existential interpretation." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Decision as Judgment**
    - Judgment is realized in the individual's response to the kerygma.
    - The decisive moment is the present encounter with the Word.
    - Eternal destiny is determined by authentic or inauthentic existence before God.
    - The focus shifts from future events to present existential reality.
    - "The real eschatological event is the decision which is made here and now." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Rejection of Apocalyptic Literalism**
    - Apocalyptic descriptions are not predictions of historical events.
    - The imagery of resurrection, judgment, and heaven/hell is symbolic.
    - The New Testament's eschatology reflects the worldview of its time.
    - Calls for a reinterpretation compatible with modern scientific understanding.
    - "We cannot use electric light and radio, and in the event of illness avail ourselves of modern medical and clinical means, and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

4. **Eternal Life as Present Possession**
    - Eternal life is not a future reward but a present reality for the believer.
    - It is experienced in authentic existence through faith in Christ.
    - The believer participates in the new age now, not merely after death.
    - The distinction between time and eternity is existential, not chronological.
    - "Eternal life is not something to be awaited in the future, but is already present." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Christ as the Eschatological Event**
    - The coming of Christ is the decisive eschatological event.
    - In Christ, the boundary between present and future is overcome.
    - The proclamation of Christ confronts each person with the demand for decision.
    - The meaning of history is disclosed in the kerygma, not in future fulfillment.
    - "The eschatological event has already taken place in the coming of Jesus Christ." (History and Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's existential reinterpretation of **final judgment** and **eternal states** profoundly influenced twentieth-century theology, especially within the **demythologization** movement. His approach challenged traditional eschatological frameworks and sparked ongoing debates about the relationship between biblical language and modern existential experience. While controversial among confessional theologians, Bultmann's work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relevance of Christian eschatology in a secular age. His legacy endures in both New Testament studies and systematic theology, particularly regarding the interpretation of **apocalyptic** texts.
