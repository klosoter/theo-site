# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the **final judgment** and **eternal states** through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the eschatological structure embedded within the biblical covenants. He argued that the **consummation** of history involves a definitive **judgment** that separates the righteous and the wicked, ushering in the **new creation** for the redeemed and **eternal punishment** for the reprobate. Kline’s distinctive focus on **intrusion ethics** and the typological function of judgment events in redemptive history shapes his understanding of the ultimate destiny of humanity.

- "The final judgment is the climactic intrusion of the sanctions of the heavenly kingdom into the history of the present world order." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Intrusion in History**
    - God’s judgments in history (e.g., the Flood, Sodom) are anticipatory intrusions of the final judgment.
    - These events serve as typological previews of the ultimate separation at the end of the age.
    - The principle of intrusion highlights the inbreaking of **eschatological realities** into the present order.
    - The final judgment is the consummate and irreversible intrusion.
    - "Historical judgments are microcosmic revelations of the final judgment." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenantal Structure of Judgment**
    - The final judgment is the outworking of the sanctions embedded in the divine covenants.
    - Blessings and curses in covenant administration point forward to eternal reward and punishment.
    - The **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** both culminate in eschatological outcomes.
    - The new creation is the inheritance promised to the faithful covenant community.
    - "The sanctions of the covenant are ultimately eschatological in their realization." (By Oath Consigned)

3. **Heaven as Consummated Kingdom**
    - The eternal state for the redeemed is the full realization of the **kingdom of God**.
    - Heaven is depicted as the archetypal temple, the dwelling place of God with his people.
    - The new heavens and new earth fulfill the typological patterns of Eden and the tabernacle.
    - The glorified state is marked by unmediated communion with God and the absence of curse.
    - "Heaven is the perfected kingdom, the telos toward which all covenant history moves." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

4. **Eternal Punishment and Exile**
    - The final judgment results in the eternal exile of the wicked from God’s presence.
    - Kline affirms the reality and justice of **eternal punishment** as the ultimate covenant curse.
    - The imagery of banishment and destruction is rooted in biblical typology (e.g., Adam’s exile).
    - The second death is the antithesis of the new creation, a perpetual state of alienation.
    - "The lake of fire is the consummate covenant curse, the final exile from the presence of the Lord." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Typology and Consummation**
    - Redemptive history is structured by typological events that foreshadow the final judgment and eternal states.
    - The exodus, conquest, and other acts of judgment prefigure the eschatological separation.
    - Typology serves to connect historical acts of God with their ultimate fulfillment in Christ’s return.
    - The consummation is both the end and the goal of all typological patterns in Scripture.
    - "The typological judgments of history find their antitype in the final judgment at the end of the age." (Images of the Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s robust articulation of **intrusion ethics** and his covenantal reading of eschatology have significantly influenced Reformed biblical theology, especially regarding the **final judgment** and the nature of the **eternal states**. His work sharpened the understanding of how redemptive history anticipates and foreshadows the ultimate destinies of humanity. Kline’s typological method and emphasis on the eschatological dimension of the covenants continue to shape contemporary discussions on biblical theology and systematic eschatology.
