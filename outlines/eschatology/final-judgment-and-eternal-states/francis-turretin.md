# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust doctrine of the **final judgment** and the **eternal states** of the righteous and the wicked. He affirmed the certainty, universality, and impartiality of the final judgment, grounding it in the justice of God and the work of Christ as mediator. Turretin maintained a clear distinction between the **intermediate state** and the **eternal state**, emphasizing the everlasting blessedness of the redeemed and the unending punishment of the reprobate.

- "The final judgment is most certain, both from the justice of God and from the express testimony of Scripture." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 20.1.1)

## Key Works

- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected sermons and disputations on eschatology
- Willem J. van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Certainty and Necessity of the Final Judgment**
    - The final judgment is a necessary consequence of **God’s justice** and the moral order of creation.
    - Scripture provides clear and repeated testimony to a universal judgment at the end of history.
    - The judgment will be public, definitive, and conducted by Christ as the appointed mediator.
    - All rational creatures, both angels and humans, will be judged according to their works.
    - "That there will be a final judgment is proved from the justice of God, which demands that the inequalities of this life be corrected." (Institutes, 20.1.2)

2. **Nature and Order of the Judgment**
    - The judgment will occur after the **resurrection of the dead** and the **second coming of Christ**.
    - The process will involve the revelation of all deeds, thoughts, and words before the assembled world.
    - The righteous and the wicked will be separated, with each receiving their due reward or punishment.
    - The judgment will vindicate God’s glory and the righteousness of his decrees.
    - "The order of the judgment will be such that the resurrection precedes, then the separation, and finally the sentence is pronounced." (Institutes, 20.2.7)

3. **Intermediate State Distinct from Eternal State**
    - Turretin distinguishes between the **intermediate state** (between death and resurrection) and the **eternal state** (after the final judgment).
    - Souls of believers enjoy conscious communion with Christ immediately after death, while the wicked experience torment.
    - The intermediate state is temporary and incomplete, awaiting the final consummation.
    - The eternal state begins only after the public judgment and resurrection.
    - "The souls of the pious are received into heaven, but their full felicity is reserved for the resurrection." (Institutes, 20.3.11)

4. **Eternal Blessedness of the Righteous**
    - The righteous will enter into **eternal life**, enjoying perfect communion with God in the new heavens and new earth.
    - Their blessedness is both spiritual and bodily, following the resurrection.
    - The reward is gracious, rooted in union with Christ, not human merit.
    - The state of glory is irreversible and everlasting.
    - "The happiness of the blessed will be perfect, perpetual, and incapable of diminution or loss." (Institutes, 20.4.14)

5. **Eternal Punishment of the Wicked**
    - The wicked will be consigned to **eternal punishment** in hell, experiencing both physical and spiritual suffering.
    - The punishment is just, proportionate, and everlasting, with no hope of restoration.
    - Turretin rejects annihilationism and affirms the conscious, unending nature of reprobate suffering.
    - The justice of God is vindicated in the eternal exclusion of the wicked from his presence.
    - "The punishment of the wicked is not only most severe, but also eternal, without any end or hope of deliverance." (Institutes, 20.5.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinctions and rigorous defense of the **final judgment** and **eternal states** shaped later Reformed confessional standards and systematic theologies. His articulation of the certainty, order, and consequences of the last judgment provided a model for orthodox Protestant eschatology. Turretin’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of **heaven, hell, and the resurrection**, especially among confessional Reformed theologians. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking clarity and fidelity on these ultimate matters.
