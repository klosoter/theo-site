# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches the **final judgment** and **eternal states** through the lens of **eschatological hope**, emphasizing God's ultimate purpose to bring about **universal reconciliation** and the renewal of all creation. He challenges traditional notions of **hell** and **retributive justice**, focusing instead on the transformative power of God's **love** and the promise of a **new creation** in Christ.

- "God’s judgment is not the end of God’s story with his creation; it is the beginning of the new creation." (The Coming of God)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as the Center of Theology**
    - Eschatology shapes all Christian theology, not just the doctrine of last things.
    - The **final judgment** is interpreted within the broader framework of **God’s promise** and future.
    - The **resurrection of the dead** and the **new creation** are central to Christian hope.
    - All doctrines, including judgment, are oriented toward the fulfillment of God’s purposes.
    - "From first to last, and not merely in the epilogue, Christianity is eschatology." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Final Judgment as Transformative, Not Merely Retributive**
    - Judgment is God's act to set things right, not simply to punish.
    - The goal is the restoration and reconciliation of all things.
    - Divine justice is inseparable from divine love and mercy.
    - The final judgment exposes evil but aims at healing and renewal.
    - "God’s judgment is creative, not merely destructive." (The Coming of God)

3. **Hope for Universal Reconciliation**
    - Moltmann entertains the possibility of **universal salvation** without dogmatically asserting it.
    - The scope of redemption is cosmic, including all creation.
    - The eternal states are envisioned as participation in the **new creation**, not static destinies.
    - Hell is understood as self-exclusion, but God’s love persistently seeks the lost.
    - "God’s love does not let go of what he has created." (The Coming of God)

4. **The New Creation as the Ultimate Goal**
    - The eternal state is not an escape from the world but its transformation.
    - The resurrection of the body affirms the goodness of creation.
    - The **kingdom of God** is realized in the renewal of all things.
    - The vision of the **new heavens and new earth** is central to Christian hope.
    - "The end is not the end, but the beginning of the new creation." (The Coming of God)

5. **Critique of Traditional Views of Hell**
    - Moltmann rejects the idea of eternal, conscious torment as incompatible with God’s love.
    - He sees hell as alienation from God, ultimately overcome by divine grace.
    - The doctrine of hell must be reinterpreted in light of **Christ’s victory** over death and evil.
    - The final word belongs to God’s mercy, not to condemnation.
    - "Hell is not an eternal concentration camp; it is the place of God’s absence, which Christ has overcome." (The Coming of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s eschatological vision has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **final judgment** and **eternal states**, especially within ecumenical and liberationist circles. His emphasis on **hope**, **universal reconciliation**, and the **renewal of creation** challenges traditional doctrines and inspires theological engagement with issues of justice and restoration. Moltmann’s work continues to provoke debate and reflection on the nature of God’s ultimate purposes for humanity and the world.
