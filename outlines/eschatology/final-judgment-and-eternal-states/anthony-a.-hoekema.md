# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema approached the **final judgment** and **eternal states** from a distinctly Reformed and amillennial perspective, emphasizing the definitive nature of Christ’s return and the ultimate realization of the **new heavens and new earth**. He rejected both annihilationism and universalism, affirming the eternal conscious existence of both the redeemed and the lost, grounded in the **resurrection of the body** and the consummation of **redemptive history**.

- "The final destiny of man is not a disembodied state, but a re-embodied existence in a renewed universe." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Key Works

- "The Bible and the Future" (1979)
- "Created in God's Image" (1986)
- "Saved by Grace" (1989)
- "The Four Major Cults" (1963) [for polemics on eschatology]
- "Eschatology" in "The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia" (contributor)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Final Judgment is Universal and Public**
    - All people, both believers and unbelievers, will appear before Christ at the final judgment.
    - The judgment will be public, vindicating God's justice and mercy before all creation.
    - Works will be evaluated as evidence of faith or unbelief, not as the basis for salvation.
    - The final judgment marks the irreversible separation of the righteous and the wicked.
    - "The final judgment will be a public event, in which the justice of God will be fully revealed." ("The Bible and the Future")

2. **Resurrection of the Body**
    - Both the righteous and the wicked will experience bodily resurrection.
    - The resurrection is physical, not merely spiritual, affirming the goodness of creation.
    - The redeemed will receive glorified bodies suited for eternal life in the new creation.
    - The wicked will be raised to judgment and eternal separation from God.
    - "The resurrection of the body is essential to the Christian hope." ("The Bible and the Future")

3. **Eternal States: Heaven as New Earth**
    - The eternal state for the redeemed is not an ethereal heaven but life on a renewed earth.
    - The new heavens and new earth represent the consummation of God's redemptive plan.
    - Believers will enjoy unbroken fellowship with God in a restored creation.
    - The continuity between the present creation and the new creation underscores redemption, not replacement.
    - "The new earth will be heaven, for God will dwell there with his people." ("The Bible and the Future")

4. **Hell as Eternal, Conscious Punishment**
    - Hoekema affirms the traditional doctrine of hell as eternal, conscious separation from God.
    - He rejects annihilationism and universalism as inconsistent with biblical teaching.
    - The wicked will experience everlasting punishment, not mere extinction.
    - The reality of hell underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of redemption.
    - "The punishment of the wicked is described as everlasting destruction." ("The Bible and the Future")

5. **Amillennial Consummation**
    - Hoekema holds to amillennialism: there is no literal earthly millennium after Christ’s return.
    - The millennium is the present reign of Christ with his saints, culminating in the final judgment.
    - Christ’s second coming brings the resurrection, judgment, and eternal states in one climactic event.
    - The focus is on the ultimate victory of Christ and the renewal of all things.
    - "The return of Christ will usher in the final judgment and the new earth, not a temporary kingdom." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s robust articulation of the **new heavens and new earth** has significantly shaped Reformed eschatology, especially in North America. His insistence on the bodily resurrection and the continuity of creation has influenced contemporary discussions on Christian hope and the nature of eternal life. By defending the traditional doctrines of final judgment and eternal punishment, he provided a clear alternative to both dispensationalism and annihilationism. His work remains a standard reference for those seeking a biblically grounded, Reformed perspective on the last things.
