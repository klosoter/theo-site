# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—present a classic Reformed doctrine of the **final judgment** and **eternal states**. They affirm the certainty of Christ’s visible return, the resurrection of the dead, and the irreversible division of humanity into **eternal life** and **eternal condemnation**, grounding both warning and comfort in the justice and mercy of God.

- "Christ will cast all His enemies into everlasting condemnation, but will take His chosen ones to Himself into heavenly joy and glory." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 52)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Certainty and Universality of the Final Judgment**
    - The **final judgment** is a definite, future event at the visible return of Christ.
    - All people, both living and dead, will appear before Christ’s judgment seat.
    - The judgment will reveal the righteousness of God and the justice of His decrees.
    - The event is public, universal, and inescapable for all humanity.
    "Finally, we believe, according to the Word of God, when the time appointed by the Lord is come... all men will personally appear before this great Judge." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

2. **Resurrection of the Body**
    - Both the righteous and the wicked will be raised bodily at the last day.
    - The resurrection is grounded in union with Christ, the firstfruits from the dead.
    - The righteous will be raised to **eternal life**; the wicked to **eternal condemnation**.
    - The resurrection affirms the goodness of creation and the hope of bodily redemption.
    "I believe that the very body which now lies in the grave shall be raised by the power of Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 57)

3. **Eternal States: Heaven and Hell**
    - The righteous will enter into **everlasting blessedness** in the presence of God.
    - The wicked will be consigned to **eternal punishment** and separation from God.
    - The eternal states are irreversible and correspond to God’s justice and mercy.
    - Assurance of eternal life is grounded in Christ’s finished work.
    "The wicked shall be sentenced by the righteous Judge to everlasting punishment, as well as the faithful and elect shall be crowned with glory and honor." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

4. **Christ as Judge and Redeemer**
    - Christ will return visibly to judge the living and the dead.
    - He executes judgment in perfect righteousness, as both Judge and Savior.
    - Believers await Christ’s return with hope, not terror, because of His mediatorial work.
    - The judgment vindicates God’s people and glorifies Christ as Lord.
    "In all my sorrow and persecution I lift up my head and eagerly await... Christ, who shall cast all His and my enemies into everlasting condemnation." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 52)

5. **Pastoral Function: Warning and Comfort**
    - The doctrine warns unbelievers of the reality of judgment and the need for repentance.
    - It comforts believers with the promise of vindication and eternal fellowship with God.
    - The confessions stress assurance for the elect, rooted in God’s promises.
    - The final judgment motivates holy living and perseverance in faith.
    "This doctrine affords unspeakable consolation to the righteous and the elect." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed teaching on the **final judgment** and **eternal states**, providing a confessional anchor for churches in the Dutch and broader continental Reformed traditions. Their clear articulation of the resurrection, judgment, and the destinies of humanity continues to inform catechesis, preaching, and pastoral care. By emphasizing both the justice and mercy of God, these confessions offer a balanced and enduring framework for understanding the last things within the Reformed tradition.
