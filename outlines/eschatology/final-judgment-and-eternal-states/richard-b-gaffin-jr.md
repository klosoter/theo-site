# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the **final judgment** and **eternal states** through the lens of **union with Christ**, emphasizing the eschatological nature of salvation and the consummation of redemptive history. He maintains that the **resurrection of Christ** is the pivotal event that inaugurates the **already/not yet** tension, shaping the believer’s hope in the final judgment and the ultimate realization of the **new creation**.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event in the accomplishment of redemption, and it is the key to understanding the future consummation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "The Eschatological Implications of Justification" (in Justification: Acts and Paul)
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (in The Glory of the Atonement)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Final Judgment as Christocentric Event**
    - The final judgment is executed by the risen and exalted Christ.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the guarantee and model of the believer’s future judgment and vindication.
    - The judgment is both forensic and transformative, rooted in union with Christ.
    - The believer’s justification anticipates the verdict of the last day.
    - "The justification of the believer is the eschatological verdict of the last day brought forward into the present." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - The final judgment and eternal states are inaugurated but not yet consummated realities.
    - Believers experience the firstfruits of resurrection life now, awaiting full realization.
    - The tension between present possession and future hope shapes Christian living.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the decisive turning point in redemptive history.
    - "The resurrection introduces the eschatological age, but its consummation awaits Christ’s return." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Resurrection as the Basis for Eternal States**
    - The bodily resurrection of Christ is the foundation for the believer’s future resurrection.
    - Eternal life is not merely spiritual but includes the renewal of the whole creation.
    - The resurrection ensures the defeat of death and the restoration of all things.
    - The eternal state is characterized by embodied, glorified existence in the new creation.
    - "The resurrection is the beginning of the new creation, the pledge of the final state." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Union with Christ and Assurance in Judgment**
    - Union with Christ secures the believer’s standing in the final judgment.
    - The verdict rendered to Christ is imputed to those united to Him by faith.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - The Spirit’s work unites believers to Christ, guaranteeing their future glorification.
    - "All that is Christ’s becomes the believer’s by virtue of union with him." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Corporate and Cosmic Dimensions of Final Judgment**
    - The final judgment involves not only individuals but the entire creation.
    - The renewal of the cosmos is integral to the eternal state.
    - The church, as the body of Christ, participates corporately in the final vindication.
    - The consummation brings about the visible reign of Christ over all things.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the eschatological transformation of the cosmos." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of **union with Christ** and the **already/not yet** framework has significantly shaped Reformed discussions of eschatology, particularly regarding the final judgment and eternal states. His Christ-centered approach to resurrection and consummation has influenced both academic theology and pastoral practice. Gaffin’s work continues to inform debates on the relationship between justification, sanctification, and glorification within the broader Reformed tradition.
