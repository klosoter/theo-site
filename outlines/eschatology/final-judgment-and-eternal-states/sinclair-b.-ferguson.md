# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson affirms the historic **Reformed doctrine** of the **final judgment** and the **eternal states** of both the righteous and the wicked. He emphasizes the certainty, justice, and Christ-centeredness of the final judgment, and teaches that the eternal destinies of **heaven** and **hell** are the ultimate outworking of God’s redemptive purposes in Christ. Ferguson’s approach is marked by pastoral sensitivity and a strong commitment to the authority of **Scripture**.

- "The final judgment will be the public manifestation of the verdict already rendered in the gospel." (The Christian Life)
