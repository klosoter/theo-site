# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the **final judgment** and **eternal states** with a strong commitment to the authority of **Scripture**, the reality of **resurrection**, and the irrevocable distinction between the destinies of the **righteous and the wicked**. He emphasized the certainty and necessity of the **last judgment**, the bodily resurrection, and the eternal, conscious existence of all people either in **glory** or **punishment**.

- "The final judgment is not only certain but necessary in the consummation of God’s redemptive purpose." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

- "The Final Judgment" (article in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Certainty and Universality of Final Judgment**
    - The final judgment is a divinely appointed event, certain for all humanity.
    - Both the righteous and the wicked will appear before the judgment seat of Christ.
    - The judgment is based on God’s perfect justice and omniscience.
    - Scripture is the ultimate authority for the doctrine of final judgment.
    - "The final judgment is not a contingency but a certainty grounded in the very nature of God’s moral government." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Bodily Resurrection of All People**
    - Both believers and unbelievers will be raised bodily at the end of the age.
    - Resurrection is essential for the full realization of either eternal life or eternal punishment.
    - The resurrection body of the righteous will be glorified, while the wicked will be raised for judgment.
    - This resurrection is a work of Christ as the last Adam and Judge.
    - "The resurrection of the body is indispensable to the consummation of redemption and judgment alike." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

3. **Irrevocable Division of Eternal States**
    - The destinies of the righteous and the wicked are eternally fixed at the judgment.
    - There is no possibility of repentance or change after the final judgment.
    - The righteous enter into everlasting life and communion with God.
    - The wicked are consigned to everlasting punishment and separation from God.
    - "There is no hint in Scripture of a second chance or post-mortem repentance; the judgment is final and irreversible." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Nature of Eternal Punishment and Reward**
    - Eternal punishment is conscious, just, and proportionate to sin.
    - Eternal life is the consummate enjoyment of God’s presence in the new creation.
    - Both states are everlasting and not annihilative.
    - The justice of God is vindicated in both reward and punishment.
    - "The eternity of punishment and the eternity of blessedness stand or fall together." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Christ as Judge and Mediator**
    - Christ is appointed by the Father as the Judge of all.
    - The final judgment is executed by Christ in his mediatorial office.
    - Union with Christ determines the outcome for the believer at judgment.
    - The work of Christ secures the acquittal and glorification of the elect.
    - "It is as the Mediator that Christ will judge the world, and in him the believer’s hope is secure." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s rigorous exposition of the **final judgment** and **eternal states** has shaped Reformed soteriology and eschatology, especially in emphasizing the seriousness and certainty of eternal destinies. His insistence on the authority of Scripture and the necessity of bodily resurrection continues to influence evangelical and Reformed theology. Murray’s clear articulation of the irrevocable division between the righteous and the wicked remains a standard reference in discussions of judgment and eternity. His work upholds the coherence of **redemptive history** and the consummation of God’s purposes in Christ.
