# Gregory K. Beale (1949–)

Gregory K. Beale approaches the **final judgment** and **eternal states** through a robustly biblical-theological lens, emphasizing the continuity of **eschatological themes** from Old to New Testament. He highlights the consummation of **God’s kingdom**, the reality of **bodily resurrection**, and the irreversible destinies of **new creation** and **eternal punishment** as central to biblical eschatology.

- "The final judgment is the climax of God’s redemptive plan, resulting in the eternal vindication of his people and the irreversible exclusion of the wicked." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- A New Testament Biblical Theology: The Unfolding of the Old Testament in the New
- The Book of Revelation (NIGTC)
- The Temple and the Church’s Mission
- Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament (co-editor)
- Revelation: A Shorter Commentary

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Final Judgment as Consummation of God’s Kingdom**
    - The final judgment marks the definitive establishment of **God’s reign** over all creation.
    - It fulfills Old Testament prophetic expectations of a universal reckoning.
    - Christ’s role as judge is central, mediating both salvation and condemnation.
    - The judgment is public, vindicating God’s justice before all creation.
    - "The final judgment is the ultimate manifestation of God’s sovereignty and justice." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

2. **Bodily Resurrection and Dual Destinies**
    - Both the righteous and the wicked will experience a **bodily resurrection**.
    - The resurrection inaugurates entry into either **new creation** or **eternal punishment**.
    - Resurrection is not merely spiritual but involves physical transformation.
    - This dual outcome is rooted in Daniel 12 and developed in Revelation.
    - "Resurrection is the gateway to the final, irreversible destinies of humanity." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

3. **Eternal States: New Creation and Second Death**
    - The **new creation** is depicted as the ultimate fulfillment of temple imagery.
    - The **lake of fire** (second death) is the permanent state for the unredeemed.
    - These states are portrayed as everlasting and unchangeable.
    - The new creation is characterized by God’s immediate presence with his people.
    - "The new creation is the eschatological temple, while the second death is exclusion from God’s presence." (The Book of Revelation)

4. **Symbolism and Reality in Eschatological Judgment**
    - Apocalyptic imagery in Revelation conveys real, ultimate outcomes.
    - Symbolic language does not negate the reality of **eternal punishment** or reward.
    - The imagery of fire, books, and thrones communicates the seriousness of judgment.
    - Beale argues for a both/and approach: symbolism points to concrete realities.
    - "The symbolic language of Revelation points to actual, eternal consequences." (The Book of Revelation)

5. **Continuity of Eschatological Themes**
    - The final judgment and eternal states are rooted in Old Testament patterns.
    - Beale traces typological connections from Eden, temple, and exile themes.
    - The new creation restores and surpasses the original creation.
    - Judgment motifs are consistent from Genesis to Revelation, showing canonical unity.
    - "The Bible’s eschatology is a unified story culminating in final judgment and new creation." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **biblical theology**, especially regarding the integration of Old and New Testament eschatology. His emphasis on the **continuity of redemptive history** and the centrality of the **new creation** motif has influenced both academic and pastoral discussions of the final judgment. By grounding his views in careful exegesis and typological analysis, Beale has provided a framework for understanding the eternal states that is both theologically rich and pastorally relevant. His scholarship continues to inform debates on the nature of **eternal punishment** and the hope of resurrection.
