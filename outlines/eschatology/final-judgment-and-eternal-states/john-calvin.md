# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin taught that the **final judgment** is a decisive act of God in which all people are resurrected and judged by Christ, resulting in either **eternal life** or **eternal punishment**. He emphasized the certainty and justice of this event, grounding it in the sovereignty of God and the work of **Christ as Mediator**. Calvin’s doctrine of the **eternal states**—heaven and hell—reflects his commitment to the reality of both **everlasting communion with God** for the redeemed and **eternal separation** for the reprobate.

- "For all must appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad." (Institutes 3.25.1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Certainty and Universality of the Final Judgment**
    - The final judgment is a fixed event decreed by God and will include all humanity.
    - Christ will serve as the judge, manifesting both his justice and mercy.
    - The resurrection of the dead precedes the judgment, ensuring both body and soul are judged.
    - The event serves to vindicate God’s righteousness before all creation.
    - "God has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by Jesus Christ." (Institutes 3.25.2)

2. **Duality of Eternal States: Heaven and Hell**
    - Calvin affirms a clear, irreversible distinction between the saved and the lost.
    - The righteous enter into **eternal life** and blessedness in the presence of God.
    - The wicked are consigned to **eternal punishment** and exclusion from God’s favor.
    - There is no possibility of repentance or change after the final judgment.
    - "There is no middle state between the blessedness of the saved and the misery of the lost." (Institutes 3.25.10)

3. **Christ as Mediator and Judge**
    - Christ’s mediatorial work is the basis for acquittal at the judgment for believers.
    - The authority to judge is given to Christ as a public vindication of his person and work.
    - The judgment reveals the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement for the elect.
    - The wicked are condemned for their unbelief and rejection of Christ.
    - "The Father has given all judgment to the Son, that he may honor him as they honor the Father." (Institutes 3.25.5)

4. **Assurance and Motivation for the Godly**
    - The certainty of final judgment provides comfort and assurance for believers.
    - It motivates the godly to pursue holiness and persevere in faith.
    - The hope of **eternal life** encourages endurance amid suffering and injustice.
    - The reality of judgment restrains evil and calls for repentance.
    - "The thought of the future judgment is a bridle to curb our evil desires." (Institutes 3.25.2)

5. **Rejection of Purgatory and Intermediate States**
    - Calvin denies any postmortem purification or intermediate state for souls.
    - At death, souls go immediately to their respective destinies, awaiting bodily resurrection.
    - The Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory is seen as unbiblical and undermining Christ’s sufficiency.
    - The final judgment is the definitive separation of the righteous and the wicked.
    - "It is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment." (Institutes 3.5.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s teaching on the **final judgment** and **eternal states** shaped the Reformed tradition’s eschatology, emphasizing the seriousness of human destiny and the centrality of Christ’s mediatorial role. His rejection of purgatory and insistence on the immediacy of the soul’s fate after death distinguished Reformed thought from Roman Catholicism. Calvin’s clear articulation of the dual outcome—eternal life or eternal punishment—continues to influence Protestant confessions and catechisms. His work remains foundational for discussions of **eschatological hope** and the justice of God in the last things.
