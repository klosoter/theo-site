# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a comprehensive doctrine of the **final judgment** and **eternal states** within the framework of **eschatology** and **systematic theology**. He taught that all humans will be resurrected and judged by Christ, resulting in either **eternal beatitude** for the righteous or **eternal punishment** for the wicked, with both states being unchangeable and definitive. Aquinas grounded these convictions in **Scripture**, **natural reason**, and the **tradition of the Church**.

- "After the universal judgment, the saints will possess the kingdom of heaven, but the wicked will be cast into eternal fire." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q99, A2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially Supplement, Questions 87–99
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 89–97
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book IV, Distinctions 47–50
- De Malo, Question 16
- Catechetical Instructions (Opuscula)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Universality and Necessity of the Final Judgment**
    - The final judgment is a public, universal event involving all rational creatures.
    - Christ, as the divine judge, will render a definitive verdict on every person.
    - The judgment will reveal God's justice and mercy to all creation.
    - The necessity of the final judgment is rooted in the need for the public vindication of God's providence.
    - "It is necessary that there should be a general judgment, both for the sake of the good and of the wicked." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q88, A1)

2. **Resurrection of the Body**
    - All humans will be resurrected in their own bodies, reconstituted by divine power.
    - The resurrection is essential for the full recompense of both reward and punishment.
    - The resurrected body will be incorruptible, suited either for glory or for punishment.
    - Aquinas affirms the identity of the resurrected body with the earthly body.
    - "Men shall rise again with the same bodies as they had during life." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q79, A1)

3. **Eternal Beatitude of the Righteous**
    - The blessed will enjoy the **beatific vision**, seeing God face to face.
    - Eternal life consists in perfect communion with God, free from all suffering.
    - The degrees of glory correspond to the merits acquired in this life.
    - The state of the blessed is immutable and everlasting.
    - "The ultimate reward of the saints is the vision of God in His essence." (Summa Theologiae, I-II, Q3, A8)

4. **Eternal Punishment of the Wicked**
    - The damned will suffer both the pain of loss (separation from God) and the pain of sense (torments).
    - Punishment is eternal, corresponding to the gravity of unrepented mortal sin.
    - The justice of eternal punishment is defended by the infinite dignity of the one offended—God.
    - There is no possibility of repentance or change after the final judgment.
    - "The punishment of the damned will be eternal, because their will is fixed in evil." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q99, A1)

5. **Immutability of the Eternal States**
    - After the final judgment, the states of both the blessed and the damned are unchangeable.
    - This immutability reflects the definitive character of the judgment.
    - The will of the blessed is perfectly aligned with God, while the will of the damned is fixed in opposition.
    - No further opportunity for merit or demerit remains after death and judgment.
    - "After the judgment, men will be no longer in the state of wayfarers, but will have arrived at their end." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q99, A2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of the **final judgment** and **eternal states** became foundational for later Catholic theology and significantly influenced Western Christian eschatology. His careful integration of **biblical exegesis**, philosophical reasoning, and patristic sources set a standard for subsequent theological reflection on the last things. The clarity and systematic nature of his teaching continue to shape discussions on **resurrection**, **heaven**, and **hell** in both academic and ecclesial contexts.
