# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a comprehensive doctrine of the **final judgment** and the **eternal states** of humanity, emphasizing the certainty, universality, and righteousness of God's judgment. They teach that at the end of the age, all people will be resurrected and judged by Christ, resulting in the **everlasting blessedness** of the righteous and the **eternal punishment** of the wicked. This eschatological vision is grounded in the **sovereignty of God**, the **justice of Christ**, and the unchangeable nature of the **covenant of grace**.

- "The end of God's appointing this day, is for the manifestation of the glory of his mercy in the eternal salvation of the elect, and of his justice in the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient." (Westminster Confession of Faith 33.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 87–90
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 37–38

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Certainty and Universality of the Final Judgment**
    - The final judgment is a definite event appointed by God.
    - All people, both righteous and wicked, will appear before Christ's judgment seat.
    - The judgment will be public and comprehensive, revealing every thought, word, and deed.
    - The purpose is to manifest God's glory in both mercy and justice.
    - "God hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world, in righteousness, by Jesus Christ." (WCF 33.1)

2. **Resurrection of the Dead**
    - At the last day, all the dead will be raised with the selfsame bodies.
    - The resurrection is both of the just and the unjust.
    - The bodies of the righteous will be made incorruptible and glorified.
    - The wicked will be raised to dishonor and shame.
    - "At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed: and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other." (WCF 32.2)

3. **Eternal Blessedness of the Righteous**
    - The righteous, through union with Christ, will enjoy everlasting life.
    - They will be openly acknowledged and acquitted in the judgment.
    - Their eternal state is one of full communion with God in glory.
    - This blessedness is unending and free from all sin and misery.
    - "The righteous shall go into everlasting life, and receive that fullness of joy and refreshing, which shall come from the presence of the Lord." (WLC 90)

4. **Eternal Punishment of the Wicked**
    - The wicked will be judged according to their works and condemned.
    - Their punishment is everlasting separation from the presence of God.
    - The justice of God is displayed in their eternal misery.
    - There is no possibility of repentance or escape after judgment.
    - "The wicked, who know not God, and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments." (WCF 33.2)

5. **Christ as Judge and the Standard of Judgment**
    - Jesus Christ is appointed by God as the Judge of all humanity.
    - Judgment will be according to the revealed will of God and the gospel.
    - The standard is God's perfect justice and the covenant of grace.
    - The judgment will vindicate God's righteousness and the sufficiency of Christ's work.
    - "In which day, not only the apostate angels shall be judged, but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth, shall appear before the tribunal of Christ." (WCF 33.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed eschatology**, providing a systematic and biblically grounded account of the final judgment and eternal states. Their articulation of the certainty of judgment, the dual destinies of humanity, and the centrality of Christ as Judge has influenced confessional documents and catechetical instruction across Presbyterian and Reformed traditions. The Standards' emphasis on the glory of God in both mercy and justice continues to inform contemporary theological reflection and pastoral practice regarding the last things.
