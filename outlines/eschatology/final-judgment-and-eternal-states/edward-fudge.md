# Edward Fudge (1944–2017)

Edward Fudge is best known for his advocacy of **conditional immortality** and the **annihilationist** view of **final judgment** and the **eternal states**. He challenged the traditional doctrine of **eternal conscious torment**, arguing from Scripture that the wicked will ultimately be destroyed rather than endlessly punished, while the redeemed will receive **eternal life** in the presence of God.

- "The wicked, following whatever degree and duration of conscious punishment God might justly inflict, will finally and truly die, perish, and be destroyed forever." ("The Fire That Consumes")

## Key Works

- The Fire That Consumes: A Biblical and Historical Study of the Doctrine of Final Punishment (1982; 3rd ed. 2011)
- Hell: A Final Word (2012)
- Two Views of Hell: A Biblical & Theological Dialogue (with Robert A. Peterson, 2000)
- "Putting Hell in Its Place" (Christianity Today, 2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Conditional Immortality**
    - Only the redeemed receive **immortality** as a gift from God.
    - The soul is not inherently immortal; immortality is conditional upon union with Christ.
    - The wicked do not possess eternal life in any form.
    - Eternal life is contrasted with destruction or perishing for the lost.
    - "God alone has immortality, and he gives it to those who are in Christ." (The Fire That Consumes)

2. **Annihilation of the Wicked**
    - The final punishment results in the complete destruction of the unredeemed.
    - Biblical language of "death," "destruction," and "perishing" is taken literally.
    - The wicked cease to exist after judgment rather than suffer eternally.
    - This view is presented as more consistent with the character of God’s justice and mercy.
    - "The wages of sin is death, not endless conscious torment." (The Fire That Consumes)

3. **Biblical Authority and Exegesis**
    - Scripture is the final authority for doctrine, including the nature of **hell**.
    - Fudge emphasizes careful exegesis of both Old and New Testament texts.
    - He critiques traditional interpretations as influenced by **Greek philosophy** and extra-biblical tradition.
    - Key passages (e.g., Matthew 10:28, Romans 6:23, Revelation 20) are interpreted in light of their literary and historical context.
    - "We must let the Bible speak for itself, without importing foreign ideas." (The Fire That Consumes)

4. **Justice and the Character of God**
    - God’s justice is perfectly balanced with his love and mercy.
    - Eternal torment is seen as incompatible with the biblical revelation of God’s character.
    - The final end of the wicked is both just and merciful: punishment followed by extinction.
    - The doctrine of annihilation upholds the seriousness of sin while avoiding the charge of cruelty.
    - "God’s justice does not require endless torture, but a punishment that fits the crime." (Hell: A Final Word)

5. **Resurrection and the Eternal State**
    - Both righteous and wicked are raised bodily for final judgment.
    - The righteous inherit **eternal life** in the new creation.
    - The wicked are judged and then destroyed, not preserved in torment.
    - The eternal state is defined by the presence or absence of life, not by ongoing suffering.
    - "The final state of the lost is extinction, not everlasting conscious pain." (The Fire That Consumes)

## Legacy and Impact

Edward Fudge’s work has been pivotal in reviving and legitimizing the **annihilationist** position within evangelical and broader Christian circles. His scholarship has prompted renewed debate about the biblical basis for **hell** and the **eternal states**, influencing theologians, pastors, and laypeople alike. While his views remain controversial, Fudge’s careful exegesis and emphasis on the **character of God** have made his arguments a significant part of contemporary discussions on final judgment.
