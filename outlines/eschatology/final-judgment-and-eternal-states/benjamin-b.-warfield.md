# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield upheld the **orthodox Reformed doctrine** of the **final judgment** and the **eternal states**, emphasizing the decisive and irreversible nature of God's verdict at the end of history. He stressed the **resurrection of the body**, the **public vindication of God's justice**, and the eternal destinies of both the righteous and the wicked, grounding these convictions in the authority of **Scripture** and the historic **confessions**.

- "The final judgment is the public manifestation of the righteousness of God in the destiny of men." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

## Key Works

- "The Millennium and the Apocalypse" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Resurrection of Christ: A Historical Fact" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Westminster Confession and Creed of Christendom"
- "The Idea of Systematic Theology"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Final Judgment as Public and Decisive**
    - The final judgment is a singular, public event at the end of history.
    - It serves to manifest God's **justice** and the moral order of the universe.
    - All humanity, both living and dead, will be summoned before Christ.
    - The verdict is final, with no further probation or opportunity for change.
    - "The judgment is not a process, but a sentence; not a probation, but a decision." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

2. **Resurrection of the Body**
    - Warfield affirms the bodily resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
    - The resurrection is essential for the full realization of human destiny.
    - It is grounded in the resurrection of Christ as the firstfruits.
    - The resurrection body is suited for the eternal state, whether of glory or punishment.
    - "The resurrection of the body is the completion of redemption." ("The Resurrection of Christ: A Historical Fact")

3. **Eternal States: Heaven and Hell**
    - The final judgment issues in two eternal destinies: **eternal life** and **eternal punishment**.
    - Heaven is the consummate fellowship with God, while hell is eternal separation and punishment.
    - Warfield rejects universalism and affirms the everlasting nature of both states.
    - These destinies are determined by one's relation to Christ.
    - "The alternatives are eternal life and eternal death, and there is no third." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

4. **Christ as Judge**
    - Christ is the appointed Judge of all humanity.
    - His judgment is both just and gracious, reflecting his dual roles as Savior and Lord.
    - The judgment will vindicate the redeemed and expose the lost.
    - Warfield ties this to the exaltation of Christ in redemptive history.
    - "It is the Lord Jesus who sits in judgment, and in Him the destinies of men are determined." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

5. **Scriptural and Confessional Authority**
    - Warfield grounds his doctrine in the authority of Scripture.
    - He appeals to the **Westminster Confession** and Reformed tradition for doctrinal clarity.
    - He insists that speculation beyond Scripture is unwarranted.
    - The final judgment and eternal states are not philosophical constructs but revealed truths.
    - "We must be content to accept the teaching of Scripture, and not seek to be wise above what is written." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust articulation of the **final judgment** and **eternal states** reinforced the continuity of Reformed orthodoxy in the face of modern skepticism and universalist tendencies. His insistence on the authority of Scripture and the confessions shaped generations of conservative Presbyterian and evangelical theologians. Warfield’s careful exegesis and theological clarity continue to inform contemporary discussions on eschatology, particularly regarding the nature of judgment, resurrection, and the eternal destinies of humanity.
