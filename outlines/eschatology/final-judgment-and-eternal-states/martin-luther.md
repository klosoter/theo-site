# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the reality of a **final judgment** in which Christ will return to judge the living and the dead, separating the righteous from the wicked. He taught that the **eternal states** of heaven and hell are determined solely by faith in Christ, emphasizing **justification by faith alone** and the ultimate consummation of salvation in the resurrection of the body.

- "He will come again to judge the living and the dead." (Small Catechism)

## Key Works

- Small Catechism (especially the Apostles’ Creed exposition)
- Large Catechism
- Commentary on Galatians
- Sermons on the Last Sunday after Trinity
- Lectures on Genesis

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Certainty of Final Judgment**
    - Christ will visibly return to judge all humanity at the end of history.
    - The judgment will be universal, encompassing both the living and the dead.
    - The standard of judgment is faith in Christ, not human works.
    - The event will inaugurate the full realization of God’s kingdom.
    - "He will come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead." (Large Catechism)

2. **Immediate State After Death**
    - The soul enters an intermediate state awaiting the resurrection.
    - Luther rejected the doctrine of purgatory as unscriptural.
    - The righteous experience rest and peace with Christ after death.
    - The wicked are separated from God, awaiting final condemnation.
    - "For just as men die once and then comes the judgment, so after death everything is ended and concluded." (Sermon on Luke 16)

3. **Resurrection of the Body**
    - At Christ’s return, all the dead will be raised bodily.
    - The resurrection is essential for the completion of salvation.
    - The righteous will receive glorified bodies fit for eternal life.
    - The wicked will also be raised to face eternal punishment.
    - "We believe in the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting." (Small Catechism)

4. **Eternal States: Heaven and Hell**
    - Heaven is eternal fellowship with God, granted to believers by grace.
    - Hell is eternal separation and punishment for the unrepentant.
    - There is no possibility of repentance or change after death.
    - The distinction is rooted in one’s relationship to Christ.
    - "Those who believe in Christ shall inherit eternal life; those who do not shall be condemned." (Large Catechism)

5. **Justification by Faith and Assurance**
    - Entrance into eternal life is by faith alone, not by works.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in Christ’s promise, not human merit.
    - Good works are evidence of faith but not the basis for judgment.
    - The believer’s confidence rests in God’s Word and sacraments.
    - "He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned." (Large Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s teaching on the **final judgment** and **eternal states** shaped Protestant eschatology by centering salvation on faith in Christ and rejecting purgatory. His emphasis on the resurrection and the immediacy of judgment after death influenced later Lutheran and Reformed confessions. Luther’s clear distinction between heaven and hell, rooted in justification by faith, remains foundational for evangelical understandings of the last things.
