# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **final judgment** and **eternal states** through his distinctive **triperspectival** framework, emphasizing the unity of God's sovereignty, the authority of Scripture, and the existential reality of eschatological hope. He affirms the historic **Reformed doctrine** of a universal, public judgment and the eternal destinies of **heaven and hell**, while stressing the practical implications for Christian life and worship.

- "The final judgment is the ultimate vindication of God's justice and grace, bringing history to its God-ordained consummation." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "Salvation Belongs to the Lord: An Introduction to Systematic Theology"
- "The Doctrine of God"
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life"
- "The Doctrine of the Word of God"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Final Judgment as Divine Vindication**
    - The final judgment is a public event where God’s justice and mercy are fully revealed.
    - Christ is the appointed Judge, acting in accordance with the will of the Father.
    - All people, both living and dead, will be judged according to their deeds and relationship to Christ.
    - The judgment demonstrates the righteousness of God and the certainty of His promises.
    - "God’s judgment is not only retributive but also revelatory, displaying his character to all creation." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Eternal States: Heaven and Hell**
    - Heaven is the eternal dwelling of the redeemed in the presence of God, characterized by joy and communion.
    - Hell is the eternal state of separation from God, marked by conscious punishment and exclusion from blessing.
    - Both states are irreversible and grounded in the justice and holiness of God.
    - The reality of eternal destinies underscores the seriousness of the gospel call.
    - "Scripture teaches the reality of both heaven and hell as eternal destinies, each manifesting God’s glory in different ways." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Triperspectival Approach to Eschatology**
    - The normative perspective emphasizes the authority of Scripture in defining final judgment and eternal states.
    - The situational perspective considers the historical and cosmic context of God’s redemptive plan.
    - The existential perspective applies eschatological truths to the believer’s life and assurance.
    - This approach seeks to integrate doctrine, experience, and obedience.
    - "We must view eschatology through the lenses of God’s word, the world’s situation, and our own hearts." ("Systematic Theology")

4. **Christ’s Centrality in Judgment**
    - Jesus Christ is the Judge, fulfilling both prophetic and kingly roles.
    - Union with Christ determines the outcome of the final judgment for believers.
    - The work of Christ provides both the standard and the means for acquittal.
    - The judgment magnifies the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement and the necessity of faith.
    - "Our hope in the final judgment rests entirely on the finished work of Christ." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

5. **Ethical and Pastoral Implications**
    - The certainty of final judgment motivates holiness and perseverance in the Christian life.
    - Assurance of eternal life fosters hope and resilience amid suffering.
    - The doctrine calls the church to faithful witness and evangelism.
    - Eschatological realities shape worship, prayer, and ethical decision-making.
    - "Eschatology is not speculation but a call to live faithfully in light of God’s coming kingdom." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s treatment of the **final judgment** and **eternal states** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by integrating doctrinal precision with practical application. His **triperspectivalism** provides a unique lens for understanding eschatology in relation to the whole of Christian doctrine and life. Frame’s work continues to shape pastors, theologians, and students seeking a biblically faithful and pastorally sensitive approach to the last things.
