# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale is a leading advocate for the **biblical-theological unity** of Scripture, emphasizing the continuity between the **old creation** and the **new creation** in the consummation of the **new heavens and new earth**. He argues that the Bible’s **eschatological hope** centers on the renewal and transformation of the entire cosmos, with the expansion of the **temple motif** as a hallmark of redemptive history.

- "The New Testament’s vision of the new heavens and new earth is the fulfillment of the Old Testament’s expectation of a renewed cosmos, not its abolition." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuity of Creation and New Creation**
   - The **new heavens and new earth** represent the transformation and fulfillment of the original creation, not its replacement.
   - Old Testament prophetic visions (e.g., Isaiah 65–66) anticipate a renewed cosmos, which the New Testament affirms.
   - The resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits and guarantee of cosmic renewal.
   - Redemption is cosmic in scope, encompassing all of creation.
   "The new creation is not a brand-new entity but the old creation transformed and glorified." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

2. **Temple as the Center of New Creation**
   - The **temple motif** runs from Eden to the consummated new creation.
   - The final state is depicted as a cosmic temple where God dwells with his people.
   - Revelation 21–22 presents the new Jerusalem as the ultimate temple-city.
   - The expansion of God’s presence is the goal of redemptive history.
   "The entire new creation will be the temple in which God’s presence fills all." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

3. **Eschatological Fulfillment in Christ**
   - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the **new creation**.
   - Believers are already participants in the new creation through union with Christ.
   - The “already/not yet” tension shapes Christian hope and ethics.
   - The new heavens and new earth are secured by Christ’s redemptive work.
   "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new creation, which will be consummated at his return." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

4. **Restoration of God’s Presence**
   - The ultimate blessing of the new creation is unmediated fellowship with God.
   - The curse of exile is reversed; God dwells permanently with his people.
   - The imagery of “God’s dwelling” in Revelation 21 echoes Old Testament promises.
   - The restoration of God’s presence is the climax of biblical eschatology.
   "The new heavens and new earth are characterized by the fullness of God’s presence among his people." (Revelation: A Shorter Commentary)

5. **Mission and the Expansion of the New Creation**
   - The church’s mission anticipates and participates in the coming new creation.
   - Evangelism and discipleship are means by which the new creation reality is extended.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling is a foretaste of the eschatological temple.
   - The hope of the new heavens and new earth motivates perseverance and holiness.
   "The church is the vanguard of the new creation, embodying its reality in the present age." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary **biblical theology**, especially regarding the integration of Old and New Testament eschatology. His emphasis on the **cosmic scope of redemption** and the centrality of the **temple motif** has influenced both academic scholarship and pastoral teaching. Beale’s articulation of the new heavens and new earth as the consummation of God’s redemptive purposes continues to inform Reformed eschatological thought and the church’s understanding of its mission in the world.
