# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth** is rooted in his Christocentric understanding of **eschatology** and the **reconciliation** accomplished in Jesus Christ. For Barth, the ultimate renewal of creation is inseparable from the **resurrection**, the **sovereignty of God’s grace**, and the fulfillment of the **covenant relationship** between God and humanity.

- "The end is not the end of God’s work, but its beginning as the new creation." (Church Dogmatics IV/3.1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics IV/3.1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics III/2: The Doctrine of Creation
- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Dogmatics in Outline
- The Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology is Christocentric**
   - The **new creation** is realized in and through Jesus Christ.
   - Christ’s resurrection is the decisive event inaugurating the new reality.
   - All hope for the **new heavens and new earth** is grounded in God’s self-revelation in Christ.
   - Eschatological fulfillment is not abstract but personal and historical in Christ.
   - "In Jesus Christ, the end has already come, and with it the new world." (Dogmatics in Outline)

2. **Reconciliation as the Basis of Renewal**
   - The **reconciliation** accomplished by Christ is the foundation for cosmic renewal.
   - The new creation is the outworking of God’s reconciling act in history.
   - Human and cosmic restoration are inseparable in Barth’s theology.
   - The **new heavens and new earth** are the consummation of reconciliation.
   - "Reconciliation means the setting up of a new heaven and a new earth." (Church Dogmatics IV/3.1)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity with Present Creation**
   - The new creation is both continuous with and radically different from the old.
   - God does not abandon creation but transforms it through judgment and grace.
   - The **resurrection** is the paradigm for understanding this transformation.
   - The old creation is judged, yet not destroyed, but renewed in Christ.
   - "The world that is reconciled is the world that is created anew." (Church Dogmatics IV/3.1)

4. **Sovereignty of Divine Grace**
   - The renewal of all things is an act of God’s free and sovereign grace.
   - Human achievement plays no role in bringing about the new creation.
   - The **new heavens and new earth** are a gift, not a human project.
   - God’s promise is the sole ground of eschatological hope.
   - "The new world is the work of God alone, not of man." (Dogmatics in Outline)

5. **Covenant Fulfillment and Universal Scope**
   - The **covenant** between God and humanity finds its fulfillment in the new creation.
   - The scope of renewal is cosmic, encompassing all of creation.
   - God’s faithfulness ensures the consummation of His redemptive purposes.
   - The **new heavens and new earth** are the final realization of God’s promise.
   - "God’s covenant means the promise of a new heaven and a new earth." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s robustly **Christocentric eschatology** has profoundly shaped modern theology’s understanding of the **new creation**. His emphasis on the sovereignty of divine grace and the inseparability of reconciliation and renewal challenged both liberal and conservative paradigms. Barth’s vision of the **new heavens and new earth** continues to influence contemporary discussions on eschatology, creation, and the cosmic scope of redemption.
