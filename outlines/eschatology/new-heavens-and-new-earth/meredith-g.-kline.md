# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline developed a distinctive biblical-theological approach to the **new heavens and new earth**, emphasizing the **eschatological fulfillment** of God's **covenantal kingdom**. He argued that the consummation of creation is not a return to Eden but the realization of the **glory-temple** pattern, where the entire cosmos becomes the dwelling place of God with his people. Kline’s interpretation of **apocalyptic imagery** and his focus on the **intrusion of the eschaton** shaped Reformed discussions of the final state.

- "The new creation is not a mere restoration of the original but an advancement to the ultimate, the realization of the archetypal Glory." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Images of the Spirit
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos
- Structure of Biblical Authority
- Treaty of the Great King

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Advancement, Not Mere Restoration**
   - The new heavens and new earth are the consummate goal, surpassing the original creation.
   - Kline rejects a simple Edenic restoration; instead, he sees the final state as the fulfillment of the **glory-temple** motif.
   - The eschaton is the telos embedded in the original creation order.
   - The new creation is characterized by the full presence and glory of God.
   - "The consummation is not a return to the beginning but the realization of the ultimate purpose of creation." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Glory-Temple as Cosmic Sanctuary**
   - The new creation is depicted as a cosmic temple, fulfilling the typology of Eden and the tabernacle.
   - God’s presence fills the entirety of the renewed cosmos.
   - The **sabbath rest** motif is realized in the eternal dwelling of God with his people.
   - The temple imagery in Revelation is central to Kline’s eschatology.
   - "The new heavens and new earth are the final cosmic temple, the perfected holy of holies." (Images of the Spirit)

3. **Intrusion Ethics and Eschatological Judgment**
   - The final judgment and renewal are anticipated by historical intrusions of the eschaton (e.g., the flood, conquest).
   - These intrusions serve as types and anticipations of the ultimate transformation.
   - The new creation is inaugurated by divine judgment and re-creation.
   - The ethical implications of the eschaton shape the church’s mission and hope.
   - "Intrusions of the end break into history as previews of the final new creation." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Covenantal Structure of Redemptive History**
   - The movement toward the new heavens and new earth is governed by God’s **covenantal administration**.
   - The **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** both point to the eschatological goal.
   - The new creation is the inheritance secured by Christ, the true covenant keeper.
   - The promises to Abraham and David find their ultimate fulfillment in the new creation.
   - "The covenantal kingdom reaches its telos in the new heavens and new earth." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

5. **Typology and Apocalyptic Imagery**
   - Kline interprets Old Testament types (Eden, Canaan, temple) as anticipations of the new creation.
   - Apocalyptic language in Scripture points to the radical transformation of the cosmos.
   - The imagery of cosmic upheaval signifies the transition from the old to the new order.
   - The book of Revelation is read as the unveiling of the final cosmic reality.
   - "The apocalyptic visions are revelations of the coming new creation, not mere symbols but realities to come." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s robust biblical-theological framework for the **new heavens and new earth** has significantly influenced Reformed eschatology and covenant theology. His emphasis on the **glory-temple** and the advancement of creation beyond Eden has shaped contemporary discussions of the final state. Kline’s typological and covenantal readings continue to inform both academic and pastoral approaches to eschatology, making his work a touchstone for those seeking a redemptive-historical understanding of the consummation.
