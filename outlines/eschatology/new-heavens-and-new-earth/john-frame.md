# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth** within the broader context of **biblical eschatology**, emphasizing the continuity between the present creation and its future consummation. He stresses the **sovereignty of God** in redemption and restoration, highlighting the comprehensive renewal of all things in Christ and the fulfillment of God's covenant promises. Frame’s perspective is shaped by his commitment to **Reformed theology**, particularly the unity of **creation, redemption, and consummation**.

- "The new heavens and new earth are not a replacement of the old, but their transformation and fulfillment in Christ." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuity of Creation and Consummation**
    - The **new heavens and new earth** represent the renewal, not the annihilation, of the present creation.
    - God’s original purposes for creation are fulfilled, not abandoned, in the eschaton.
    - Redemption restores and perfects what was lost in the Fall.
    - The physical and spiritual aspects of creation are both included in the final renewal.
    - "God does not discard his creation, but redeems and glorifies it." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - The work of Christ is central to the transformation of all things.
    - The resurrection of Jesus is the firstfruits of the new creation.
    - All of history moves toward consummation in Christ’s return.
    - The new creation is the ultimate realization of union with Christ.
    - "The resurrection of Christ guarantees the renewal of the whole cosmos." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Covenantal Consummation**
    - The new heavens and new earth fulfill God’s covenant promises to his people.
    - The biblical covenants anticipate a restored creation where God dwells with his people.
    - The eschatological hope is grounded in God’s faithfulness to his word.
    - The church participates now in the blessings that will be fully realized in the new creation.
    - "God’s covenant is not only with individuals, but with creation itself." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Holistic Redemption**
    - Salvation encompasses both spiritual and material realities.
    - The effects of sin are reversed in every sphere of existence.
    - The new creation involves justice, peace, and the restoration of all relationships.
    - The ethical implications of eschatology call believers to live in light of the coming renewal.
    - "Redemption is cosmic in scope, touching every part of God’s world." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

5. **Trinitarian Sovereignty**
    - The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all active in bringing about the new creation.
    - The eschatological renewal is a display of God’s sovereign power and grace.
    - The Spirit’s work in believers is a foretaste of the coming consummation.
    - The triune God’s presence will be fully manifested in the new heavens and new earth.
    - "The triune God’s glory will fill the new creation as the waters cover the sea." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **new heavens and new earth** has reinforced a robustly Reformed, covenantal, and Christ-centered eschatology within contemporary evangelical theology. His emphasis on the continuity of creation and redemption has influenced discussions on the relationship between **creation, culture, and consummation**. Frame’s work continues to shape pastors, theologians, and students who seek a biblically grounded and theologically integrated vision of the Christian hope.
