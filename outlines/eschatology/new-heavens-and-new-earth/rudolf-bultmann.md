# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the concept of the **new heavens and new earth** through his program of **demythologization**, interpreting eschatological language existentially rather than cosmologically. For Bultmann, the biblical promise of a renewed creation is not a literal future event but a symbol of the **eschatological encounter** with God in the present, realized through faith and the proclamation of the **kerygma**.

- "The eschatological event is not a cosmic catastrophe but the decision of man in the present." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Eschatology**
   - Interprets apocalyptic imagery as mythological language expressing existential truths.
   - Rejects a literal, physical transformation of the cosmos.
   - Sees the **new creation** as a metaphor for personal transformation through faith.
   - Emphasizes the need to translate biblical eschatology into contemporary existential categories.
   - "Mythological eschatology must be replaced by an existential understanding of the future." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Salvation**
   - Salvation is realized in the individual's encounter with the **Word of God**.
   - The "new earth" signifies a new mode of existence, not a future physical reality.
   - Focuses on the present decision of faith rather than future fulfillment.
   - The **kerygma** calls individuals into authentic existence before God.
   - "Eternal life is not a future event but a present reality for the believer." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Apocalyptic Literalism**
   - Views apocalyptic texts as products of a pre-scientific worldview.
   - Argues that modern people cannot accept a literal cosmic renewal.
   - Maintains that the message of the New Testament must be freed from outdated cosmologies.
   - The **new heavens and new earth** are symbolic of the radical change in human existence.
   - "The world-picture of the New Testament is obsolete for modern man." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
   - The proclamation of Christ is the locus of eschatological fulfillment.
   - The **new creation** is realized wherever the gospel is received in faith.
   - The church's mission is to proclaim existential transformation, not predict cosmic events.
   - The **kerygma** redefines eschatology as present encounter, not future hope.
   - "The kerygma itself is the eschatological event." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Eschatology as Decision**
   - The decisive moment is the individual's response to God's call.
   - The "end" is not a chronological event but an existential crisis.
   - The **new heavens and new earth** are experienced in the now of faith.
   - Eschatological language expresses the urgency of authentic existence.
   - "Eschatology is not about the end of the world, but about the end of the old self." (History and Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's existential reinterpretation of the **new heavens and new earth** has profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in the realms of **hermeneutics** and New Testament studies. His approach challenged traditional eschatological frameworks and provoked ongoing debate about the relationship between biblical language and contemporary understanding. While often criticized for evacuating biblical hope of its cosmic dimension, Bultmann's influence endures in discussions of **demythologization** and the existential relevance of Christian proclamation.
