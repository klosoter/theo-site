# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann’s doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth** is rooted in his distinctive **theology of hope**, which places **eschatology** at the center of Christian doctrine. He emphasizes the inseparable connection between **resurrection**, **creation**, and the **eschatological fulfillment** of God’s redemptive purpose for the entire cosmos.

- "God’s righteousness is not only the end of the old world, but the beginning of the new earth in which righteousness dwells." ("The Coming of God")

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- God in Creation (1985)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as the Heart of Christian Doctrine**
    - Eschatology is the central driving force of all Christian theology.
    - The **new creation** is the fulfillment of God’s promises, not merely the end of history.
    - The future of God shapes present Christian existence and mission.
    - Hope in the **new heavens and new earth** energizes ethical engagement with the world.
    - "From first to last, and not merely in the epilogue, Christianity is eschatology." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Cosmic Scope of Redemption**
    - The **new creation** involves the transformation of the entire cosmos, not just individual souls.
    - Redemption is physical, social, and ecological, encompassing all of reality.
    - The **resurrection of the dead** is inseparable from the renewal of the earth.
    - The final state is a reconciled, healed creation, not an escape from material existence.
    - "God’s kingdom comes when the earth becomes the home of righteousness, peace, and joy." (The Coming of God)

3. **Integration of Creation and Eschatology**
    - Creation and eschatology are two poles of God’s single redemptive plan.
    - The **new earth** is the consummation of the original creation, not its abolition.
    - The Spirit’s work in creation anticipates its eschatological renewal.
    - Human vocation is to anticipate and participate in this renewal.
    - "The end is not the abolition of creation, but its new beginning." (God in Creation)

4. **Critique of Dualism and Escapism**
    - Rejects Platonic or Gnostic tendencies that devalue the material world.
    - The **new heavens and new earth** affirm the goodness of creation.
    - Salvation is not flight from the world but its transformation.
    - The Christian hope is public, historical, and cosmic, not private or otherworldly.
    - "The world is not to be abandoned, but transformed in the power of hope." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Political and Ethical Implications**
    - Eschatological hope demands active engagement in justice, peace, and ecological stewardship.
    - The vision of the **new creation** critiques and inspires transformation of present realities.
    - Christian ethics are grounded in anticipation of God’s coming future.
    - The church is called to be a sign and foretaste of the coming **kingdom of God**.
    - "Those who hope in Christ can no longer put up with reality as it is." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s vision of the **new heavens and new earth** has profoundly shaped contemporary **eschatology**, especially in its cosmic, ecological, and public dimensions. His integration of hope, creation, and redemption has influenced both academic theology and practical Christian ethics. By insisting on the material and communal character of the eschatological future, Moltmann has challenged the church to live as a sign of God’s coming kingdom in the world. His work continues to inspire theological reflection on the relationship between **creation, redemption, and eschatological fulfillment**.
