# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth** is grounded in his robust commitment to the **sovereignty of God**, the **goodness of creation**, and the **eschatological fulfillment** of redemption. He interprets the final state as the renewal and restoration of the entire created order, emphasizing the continuity between the present world and its future glorified state under **Christ’s lordship**.

- "God will restore the present world, purging it of all corruption, so that it may be perfected together with its inhabitants." (Institutes 3.25.3)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book III, chapters 24–25)
- Commentary on 2 Peter (esp. 2 Peter 3:13)
- Commentary on Isaiah (esp. Isaiah 65–66)
- Sermons on 2 Thessalonians and 1 Corinthians 15
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Restoration, not Annihilation**
    - The final state involves the **renewal** of creation, not its destruction.
    - Calvin insists that God will **purge** the world of corruption, not abolish it.
    - The continuity of creation reflects God’s original purpose and faithfulness.
    - The new earth will be the perfected home of the redeemed.
    - "For as the curse has infected the world, so must it be cleansed in order that it may be restored to its pristine condition." (Institutes 2.1.5)

2. **Christ’s Cosmic Lordship**
    - The reign of **Christ** extends over all creation, not just the church.
    - The new creation is the consummation of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Calvin connects the resurrection of believers to the renewal of the cosmos.
    - Christ’s victory ensures the final restoration of all things.
    - "Christ came to restore all things, both in heaven and on earth." (Commentary on Colossians 1:20)

3. **Goodness of Creation**
    - Creation is fundamentally **good**, despite its present corruption.
    - The material world is not inherently evil or to be discarded.
    - The new heavens and new earth affirm God’s original creative intent.
    - The physicality of the new creation is a sign of God’s faithfulness.
    - "God did not create the world to be a fleeting show, but to be the theater of his glory." (Commentary on Genesis 1:31)

4. **Eschatological Hope and Assurance**
    - Believers are called to hope for the **resurrection** and the renewal of all things.
    - The promise of the new creation provides comfort amid suffering.
    - Assurance is grounded in God’s unchanging promises and Christ’s resurrection.
    - The future state motivates present holiness and perseverance.
    - "We look for a better life, where we shall be clothed with a new nature, free from all corruption." (Institutes 3.25.10)

5. **Judgment and Purification**
    - The transition to the new heavens and new earth involves **judgment** and purification.
    - Fire is a metaphor for God’s purifying action, not total destruction.
    - The wicked are excluded from the renewed creation.
    - The righteous inherit the earth, now made fit for eternal habitation.
    - "The world will be cleansed by fire, but not destroyed, so that it may be restored to a better state." (Commentary on 2 Peter 3:13)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s vision of the **new heavens and new earth** has profoundly shaped Reformed eschatology, emphasizing the continuity of creation and the cosmic scope of redemption. His insistence on the restoration rather than annihilation of the world has influenced later theologians to value the material order and anticipate its renewal. Calvin’s teaching continues to inform contemporary discussions on **creation, redemption, and eschatological hope** within the Reformed tradition.
