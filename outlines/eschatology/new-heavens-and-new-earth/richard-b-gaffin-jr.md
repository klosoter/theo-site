# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. emphasizes the **eschatological renewal** of creation in the doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth**, grounding it in the resurrection of Christ as the firstfruits of cosmic restoration. He insists that **redemption** is not an escape from creation but its consummation, culminating in the full realization of **resurrection life** and the **kingdom of God** in a renewed cosmos.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new creation, the new heavens and new earth." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" in The Glory of the Atonement (ed. Hill & Letham)
- "The Eschatological Implications of the Resurrection" (various essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology is Already–Not Yet**
    - The **new creation** is inaugurated in Christ’s resurrection but awaits consummation.
    - Believers participate in the **age to come** through union with Christ.
    - The tension between present possession and future fulfillment shapes Christian hope.
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the down payment of the coming new heavens and new earth.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the eschatological event, the beginning of the new creation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Redemption is Cosmic, Not Merely Individual**
    - Salvation encompasses the renewal of the entire created order, not just souls.
    - The **curse on creation** is reversed in Christ’s work.
    - The final state is a transformed, not annihilated, cosmos.
    - The **new heavens and new earth** fulfill God’s original creational intent.
    - "Redemption means the restoration of creation, not its abandonment." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Resurrection as the Pattern of Renewal**
    - Christ’s bodily resurrection is the prototype for the renewal of all things.
    - The believer’s resurrection is inseparable from the renewal of the cosmos.
    - The continuity and transformation of the body parallels that of creation.
    - The **resurrection** signals the defeat of death and the dawn of new creation.
    - "The resurrection is not only personal but cosmic in its implications." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Kingdom of God is Creation Consummated**
    - The **kingdom** is not a spiritual abstraction but the perfected creation.
    - The new heavens and new earth are the arena of God’s final reign.
    - The **cultural mandate** finds fulfillment in the eschaton.
    - The kingdom’s fullness is realized only in the new creation.
    - "The kingdom of God is the new creation, the new heavens and new earth." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - There is real continuity between the present world and the new creation.
    - Discontinuity arises from the radical transformation wrought by resurrection.
    - The **old order** passes away, but creation itself is not destroyed.
    - The new heavens and new earth are both familiar and gloriously new.
    - "The new creation is this creation, renewed and transformed by the power of Christ’s resurrection." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of **inaugurated eschatology** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology’s understanding of the new heavens and new earth. His insistence on the cosmic scope of redemption has influenced discussions on the relationship between **creation and consummation**. Gaffin’s work continues to inform debates on the continuity of creation, the significance of the resurrection, and the eschatological hope of believers. His legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on the resurrection as the foundation for Christian eschatology.
