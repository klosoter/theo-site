# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a robust doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth** within the framework of **eschatology** and **resurrection**. He emphasized the **restoration and perfection of creation** through the final consummation, where both the material and spiritual realms are renewed in harmony with **God’s ultimate purpose**.

- "The world itself will be renewed, so that it will be better suited to serve the glorified" (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q91, A1).

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Questions 91–97
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 95–97
- Commentary on 2 Peter (Super Epistolam B. Petri II)
- De Veritate, Question 8

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection of the Body**
    - The resurrection involves the **reunion of soul and glorified body**.
    - Bodies will be restored to their **natural integrity and perfection**.
    - The resurrected body will be **incorruptible and impassible**.
    - This transformation is a work of **divine omnipotence**.
    - "The bodies of the risen will be spiritual, not by nature, but by the glory of the soul overflowing into the body." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q82, A1)

2. **Renewal of the Cosmos**
    - The **material world** will not be annihilated but **purified and perfected**.
    - The new creation will be free from **corruption and disorder**.
    - The renewal serves the **glorified saints** and reflects God’s glory.
    - The **order of nature** will be preserved but elevated.
    - "The world itself will be renewed, so that it will be better suited to serve the glorified." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q91, A1)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity**
    - There is **continuity** between the present world and the renewed creation.
    - The **substance** of creation remains, but its **qualities are transformed**.
    - Discontinuity lies in the **absence of corruption, suffering, and death**.
    - The new heavens and earth will manifest **perfect order and beauty**.
    - "The substance of the world will remain, but the quality will be changed for the better." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q91, A2)

4. **Final State of the Righteous and Wicked**
    - The **righteous** will dwell in the renewed creation in **beatific vision**.
    - The **wicked** will be excluded from the blessings of the new creation.
    - The distinction between the two is **eternal and irreversible**.
    - The new heavens and earth are the **inheritance of the saints**.
    - "The renewal of the world is ordered to the glory of the blessed." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q91, A1)

5. **God’s Ultimate Purpose in Renewal**
    - The renewal fulfills **God’s justice and mercy**.
    - It demonstrates the **final victory over sin and death**.
    - The new creation is the **culmination of divine providence**.
    - All things are restored to their **proper end in God**.
    - "God will renew the world for the sake of the elect, so that they may rejoice in Him more fully." (Summa Contra Gentiles, IV.97)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s vision of the **new heavens and new earth** shaped medieval and later Christian eschatology, especially in the **Roman Catholic tradition**. His careful distinction between continuity and transformation influenced subsequent theological discussions on the nature of resurrection and cosmic renewal. Aquinas’s synthesis of **biblical teaching** and **philosophical reasoning** continues to inform contemporary debates about the destiny of creation and the hope of final restoration.
