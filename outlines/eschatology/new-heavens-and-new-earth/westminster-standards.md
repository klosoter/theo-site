# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a robust doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth** within the broader context of **eschatology**. They emphasize the **consummation** of all things at Christ’s return, the **resurrection of the dead**, and the transformation of creation, highlighting the eternal blessedness of the redeemed and the final judgment of the wicked.

- "The bodies of the just shall, by his Spirit, be raised to honour, and be made conformable to his own glorious body." (Westminster Confession of Faith 32.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 32–33)
- Larger Catechism (Questions 84–90)
- Shorter Catechism (Questions 37–38)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on funerals and the resurrection)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on the last things)

    - The righteous are raised to **everlasting life**; the wicked to **everlasting shame**.
    - The resurrection is patterned after **Christ’s own resurrection**.
    - The body and soul are reunited for **eternal existence**.
    - "At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed." (WCF 32.1)

    - The judgment is based on **union with Christ** and the evidence of faith.
    - "The end of God's appointing this day is for the manifestation of the glory of his mercy in the eternal salvation of the elect, and of his justice in the damnation of the reprobate." (WCF 33.2)

3. **Renewal of Creation**
    - The **new heavens and new earth** are a renewal, not annihilation, of the present creation.
    - Creation is freed from the **bondage of corruption**.
    - The redeemed will dwell bodily in a **restored cosmos**.
    - The new creation is the **eternal dwelling place** of God with his people.
    - "In the day of judgment, the righteous shall be caught up to Christ, and reign with him upon the new heavens and the new earth." (Larger Catechism Q90)

4. **Eternal State of the Redeemed**
    - The **blessedness** of the redeemed is both spiritual and physical.
    - They enjoy **immediate communion with God** forever.
    - The fullness of **salvation** is realized in the new creation.
    - There is no more **sin, sorrow, or death**.
    - "The souls of the righteous... are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God in light and glory." (WCF 32.1)

5. **Christ’s Mediatorial Kingship Consummated**
    - Christ’s **mediatorial reign** culminates in the final state.
    - He delivers the kingdom to the Father after destroying all enemies.
    - The **new heavens and new earth** are the arena of his eternal kingship.

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped Reformed and Presbyterian understandings of the **new heavens and new earth**, emphasizing the continuity between creation and consummation. Their teaching on the resurrection, final judgment, and the eternal state remains foundational for confessional Reformed theology. The Standards’ vision of a renewed creation underscores the hope of bodily resurrection and the ultimate restoration of all things in Christ. Their eschatology continues to influence contemporary discussions on the Christian hope and the destiny of creation.
