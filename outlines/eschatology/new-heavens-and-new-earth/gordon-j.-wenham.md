# Gordon J. Wenham (1943–)

Gordon J. Wenham approaches the **new heavens and new earth** through a close reading of the **Pentateuch** and **biblical theology**, emphasizing the continuity between **creation** and **eschatological renewal**. He highlights the way Old Testament texts anticipate a **restored cosmos**, where God's purposes for humanity and the world are ultimately fulfilled.

- "The hope of a new heaven and a new earth is rooted in the earliest chapters of Genesis." (Story as Torah, p. 103)

## Key Works

- Genesis 1–15 (Word Biblical Commentary)
- Genesis 16–50 (Word Biblical Commentary)
- Story as Torah: Reading Old Testament Narrative Ethically
- Psalms as Torah: Reading Biblical Song Ethically
- Exploring the Old Testament: A Guide to the Pentateuch

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation as the Pattern for Eschatological Renewal**
    - The original **creation order** in Genesis serves as the blueprint for the **new creation**.
    - The **goodness of creation** is affirmed and destined for restoration, not abandonment.
    - Eschatological visions in the prophets echo the **Edenic ideal**.
    - The **new heavens and new earth** represent the fulfillment of God's original intent.
    - "The Bible begins with creation and ends with new creation, showing the unity of God's purpose." (Genesis 1–15)

2. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Redemptive History**
    - There is both **continuity** (restoration) and **discontinuity** (transformation) between the present world and the new creation.
    - The **flood narrative** prefigures both judgment and renewal.
    - Prophetic literature (e.g., Isaiah) envisions a transformed cosmos, not merely a spiritual state.
    - The **material world** is not discarded but renewed.
    - "The prophets look forward to a time when the curse is lifted and creation is restored." (Story as Torah)

3. **Ethical Implications of Eschatological Hope**
    - The hope of a **new earth** grounds ethical responsibility in the present.
    - Human stewardship of creation is affirmed by the prospect of its renewal.
    - The **law** and **narrative** of the Pentateuch encourage care for the world.
    - Eschatology motivates obedience and hope, not escapism.
    - "The expectation of a renewed earth calls for responsible living now." (Story as Torah)

4. **Integration of Old and New Testament Eschatology**
    - The **Old Testament** vision of cosmic renewal is foundational for **New Testament** eschatology.
    - Revelation’s imagery of the new heavens and new earth draws on Genesis and the prophets.
    - There is a thematic unity between **creation, fall, redemption, and consummation**.
    - The **biblical narrative** moves from Eden to New Jerusalem.
    - "The New Testament writers build on Old Testament hopes for a renewed creation." (Genesis 1–15)

5. **God’s Presence as the Goal of New Creation**
    - The climax of the new creation is **God dwelling with his people**.
    - The **tabernacle** and **temple** prefigure the fullness of God’s presence in the new earth.
    - The removal of sin and curse enables unmediated fellowship with God.
    - The **restored cosmos** is the ultimate temple.
    - "The new heavens and new earth are where God’s presence is fully realized among his people." (Psalms as Torah)

## Legacy and Impact

Wenham’s scholarship has shaped contemporary understanding of the **biblical theology of creation and eschatology**, especially within evangelical circles. His careful exegesis of Genesis and the Pentateuch has highlighted the importance of the **new heavens and new earth** as a central biblical theme. By integrating ethical reflection with eschatological hope, Wenham has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to creation care and Christian hope. His work continues to inform discussions on the unity of Scripture and the future of the created order.
