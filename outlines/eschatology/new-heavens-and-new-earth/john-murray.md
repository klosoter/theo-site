# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray’s doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth** is grounded in a robustly **Reformed eschatology** that emphasizes the continuity and renewal of creation rather than its annihilation. He insists that the consummation of **redemptive history** involves the transformation of the entire created order, fulfilling God’s original purpose in **creation** and **redemption** through Christ.

- "The biblical expectation is not the annihilation of the cosmos but its renewal and glorification." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Epistle to the Romans" (especially commentary on Romans 8:18–25)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "The Advent of Jesus Christ" (sermons and essays)
- "Principles of Conduct"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuity of Creation**
    - Creation itself is not discarded but renewed in the consummation.
    - The effects of the fall are reversed, not by destruction, but by restoration.
    - The material world is affirmed as part of God’s good purpose.
    - The new earth is the fulfillment, not the negation, of the original creation.
    - "The new creation is the present creation emancipated from all the consequences of sin." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Cosmic Scope of Redemption**
    - Redemption in Christ extends to the whole created order, not just humanity.
    - The liberation of creation is tied to the glorification of the children of God.
    - The curse is removed from the cosmos as part of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The eschatological hope is both personal and cosmic in scope.
    - "The redemption accomplished by Christ is as comprehensive as the extent of the curse." (Romans, p. 303)

3. **Resurrection and Transformation**
    - The resurrection of the body is a pattern for the renewal of the earth.
    - Transformation, not replacement, is the mode of eschatological fulfillment.
    - The glorified state involves continuity with the present order, yet is qualitatively new.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits of the new creation.
    - "The resurrection of the body is the guarantee of the renewal of creation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Fulfillment of Covenant Promise**
    - The promise to Abraham includes the inheritance of the world.
    - The new heavens and new earth are the realization of God’s covenant purposes.
    - Eschatology is rooted in the unfolding of the covenant of grace.
    - The land promise finds its ultimate fulfillment in the renewed cosmos.
    - "The inheritance of the world is integral to the promise made to Abraham." (Romans, p. 299)

5. **God’s Glory in Eschatological Consummation**
    - The final state displays the fullness of God’s glory in all creation.
    - The new heavens and new earth are the theater of God’s eternal praise.
    - The consummation is the ultimate vindication of God’s creative and redemptive work.
    - The glory of God is both the goal and content of the new creation.
    - "The ultimate design is the manifestation of the glory of God in the new heavens and the new earth." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s teaching on the **new heavens and new earth** has significantly shaped Reformed eschatology, emphasizing the continuity of creation and the cosmic scope of redemption. His careful exegesis of Romans 8 and his insistence on the transformation rather than annihilation of the cosmos have influenced generations of theologians. Murray’s work continues to inform contemporary discussions on creation, redemption, and the ultimate hope of believers.
