# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema championed a robustly **Reformed eschatology** that emphasizes the **continuity between the present creation and the future new heavens and new earth**. He rejected a purely spiritualized or otherworldly view of the final state, insisting that **redemption** encompasses the whole cosmos and culminates in a **renewed, perfected creation** where God's people dwell bodily with Him forever.

- "The new earth will not be a totally different earth, but a renewed earth, purified from sin and all its effects." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Key Works

- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- Created in God's Image (1986)
- "Heaven: Not Just an Eternal Day Off" (Christianity Today, 1980)
- "The Reformed Perspective on the Millennium" (in The Meaning of the Millennium, 1977)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redemption Involves Cosmic Renewal**
    - The scope of **redemption** is not limited to individual souls but includes the entire created order.
    - The **new earth** is the present earth transformed and liberated from the effects of sin.
    - Hoekema rejects the idea of total annihilation of the old creation.
    - The **resurrection of the body** parallels the renewal of the cosmos.
    - "God will renew the entire creation, and man will live on the new earth in resurrection bodies." (The Bible and the Future)

2. **Continuity and Discontinuity**
    - There is both **continuity** (identity) and **discontinuity** (transformation) between the present and future creation.
    - The new earth will retain recognizable features of the current world, yet be free from all corruption.
    - Human cultural achievements, purified from sin, may carry over into the new creation.
    - The **eschatological hope** is not escape but transformation.
    - "There is continuity between the present earth and the new earth, just as there is continuity between our present bodies and our resurrection bodies." (The Bible and the Future)

3. **Physicality of the Final State**
    - The final state is not an ethereal, immaterial existence but a **bodily, physical life** in a renewed world.
    - Believers will enjoy **resurrected bodies** in a tangible, glorified creation.
    - The new heavens and new earth will be the scene of real activity, service, and worship.
    - Hoekema opposes dualistic views that devalue the material.
    - "The life to come will be life on a renewed earth, not a disembodied existence in a faraway heaven." (The Bible and the Future)

4. **God’s Presence and Kingdom Consummated**
    - The **dwelling of God with man** is the central blessing of the new creation.
    - The **kingdom of God** reaches its consummation in the new heavens and new earth.
    - There will be perfect fellowship, righteousness, and peace.
    - The curse is fully and finally removed.
    - "The most wonderful thing about the new earth is that God will dwell with his people in a way never before experienced." (The Bible and the Future)

5. **Eschatology Shapes Present Life**
    - The hope of the **new creation** motivates Christian living and cultural engagement now.
    - Believers are called to live as citizens of the coming kingdom, anticipating its arrival.
    - The future renewal of creation gives dignity and purpose to present earthly life.
    - The doctrine guards against both worldliness and escapism.
    - "Our present lives are to be lived in the light of the future new earth, for what we do now has significance for eternity." (The Bible and the Future)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of the **new heavens and new earth** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed eschatology, especially in emphasizing the **cosmic scope of redemption** and the goodness of creation. His insistence on continuity between the present and future world has influenced discussions on Christian cultural engagement and the nature of eternal life. Hoekema’s work remains a standard reference for those seeking a biblically grounded, holistic vision of the Christian hope.
