# N.T. Wright (1948– )

N.T. Wright emphasizes the **bodily resurrection** and the **renewal of creation** as central to the biblical vision of the **new heavens and new earth**. He rejects a purely spiritualized afterlife, arguing that **God’s ultimate purpose** is the transformation and restoration of the entire cosmos, not its abandonment. Wright’s approach situates eschatology firmly within the narrative of **God’s covenant faithfulness** and the fulfillment of **biblical promises**.

- "God intends to renew the whole creation, and the resurrection of Jesus is the beginning of that renewal." ("Surprised by Hope")

## Key Works

- Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church
- The Resurrection of the Son of God (Christian Origins and the Question of God, Vol. 3)
- Paul and the Faithfulness of God
- Simply Christian: Why Christianity Makes Sense
- Evil and the Justice of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bodily Resurrection as Central**
    - The resurrection is not merely spiritual but involves the transformation of physical bodies.
    - Jesus’ resurrection is the prototype and guarantee of believers’ future resurrection.
    - The resurrection affirms the goodness of creation and God’s intent to redeem it.
    - Denies escapist views that separate salvation from the material world.
    - "The point of resurrection... is that the present bodily life is not valueless just because it will die." ("Surprised by Hope")

2. **Renewal, Not Replacement, of Creation**
    - The new heavens and new earth represent the renewal, not the destruction, of the current creation.
    - God’s redemptive plan encompasses all of creation, not just human souls.
    - The biblical narrative culminates in restoration, echoing Genesis in Revelation.
    - Rejects dualistic views that pit spirit against matter.
    - "Heaven, in the Bible, is not a future destiny but the other, hidden dimension of our ordinary life." ("Surprised by Hope")

3. **Eschatology Rooted in Covenant Faithfulness**
    - God’s promises to Israel are fulfilled in the renewal of creation.
    - The new creation is the outworking of God’s faithfulness to his covenant people.
    - Eschatology is inseparable from the story of Israel and Jesus as Messiah.
    - The church participates in God’s ongoing work of renewal.
    - "The resurrection is the launching of God’s new creation." ("The Resurrection of the Son of God")

4. **Mission of the Church in Anticipation of New Creation**
    - The church is called to live as a sign and foretaste of the coming new creation.
    - Christian mission includes care for creation and social justice as anticipatory acts.
    - Worship and sacramental life point forward to the ultimate renewal.
    - The hope of new creation energizes present action, not passive waiting.
    - "What you do in the present... will last into God’s future." ("Surprised by Hope")

5. **Integration of Heaven and Earth**
    - The biblical vision is of heaven and earth coming together, not remaining separate.
    - The final state is communal, embodied, and located within a renewed cosmos.
    - Salvation is holistic, involving both spiritual and physical realities.
    - The new Jerusalem imagery underscores God’s dwelling with humanity.
    - "The final coming together of heaven and earth is the ultimate hope." ("Surprised by Hope")

## Legacy and Impact

Wright’s articulation of the **new heavens and new earth** has significantly influenced contemporary eschatology, challenging traditional views of heaven as a disembodied state. His work has encouraged renewed emphasis on the **goodness of creation**, the importance of bodily resurrection, and the church’s mission in the world. Wright’s scholarship has shaped both academic and popular understandings of Christian hope, making the doctrine of new creation central to discussions of biblical theology and Christian practice.
