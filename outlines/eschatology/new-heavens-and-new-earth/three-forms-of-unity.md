# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust **Reformed eschatology** centered on the hope of the **new heavens and new earth** as the consummation of God’s redemptive work. They emphasize the restoration of creation, the final defeat of sin and death, and the eternal blessedness of the redeemed in perfect fellowship with God. This vision is grounded in the **covenant of grace**, the resurrection of the body, and the renewal of all things in Christ.

- "We expect that at the last day... our Lord Jesus Christ will come from heaven... and will make all things new." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

## Legacy and Impact

These confessions have fostered a hope that is both future-oriented and rooted in the present reality of union with Christ, influencing generations of theologians and church members alike.
