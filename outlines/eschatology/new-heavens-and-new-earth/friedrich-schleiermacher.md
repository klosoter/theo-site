# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the **new heavens and new earth** not as a literal eschatological event but as the culmination of **God-consciousness** and the progressive realization of the divine in human history. He reinterpreted **eschatology** in terms of the ultimate fulfillment of **religious self-consciousness** and the ethical transformation of humanity, rather than a physical renewal of creation. For Schleiermacher, the final state is the perfecting of the relationship between God and the world, realized through the ongoing development of the **church** and human community.

- "The consummation of the kingdom of God is the highest good, in which the divine and the human are united in perfect harmony." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Ethical and Spiritual Fulfillment**
    - The **new heavens and new earth** signify the ethical perfection of humanity, not a physical transformation.
    - Emphasizes the realization of the **kingdom of God** within the historical process.
    - Views eschatological hope as the culmination of **God-consciousness** in the community.
    - Rejects literal apocalypticism in favor of spiritual and moral progress.
    - "The end of all things is the complete predominance of the God-consciousness in the church." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Continuity of Creation and Redemption**
    - Sees no radical discontinuity between the present world and its consummation.
    - Redemption is the gradual unfolding of the divine purpose within history.
    - The **church** is the locus where the new creation is anticipated and partially realized.
    - The transformation is qualitative, not ontological, emphasizing spiritual renewal.
    - "The new creation is not a second world, but the completion of the first." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Centrality of God-Consciousness**
    - The perfection of **God-consciousness** is the goal of history and eschatology.
    - The new state is defined by the full realization of the divine in human experience.
    - Individual and communal consciousness are both oriented toward this fulfillment.
    - The eschaton is the state where alienation from God is overcome.
    - "Blessedness consists in the uninterrupted fellowship with God." (The Christian Faith)

4. **The Church as the Bearer of Eschatological Hope**
    - The **church** embodies the ongoing realization of the new creation.
    - Eschatological fulfillment is mediated through the life and witness of the Christian community.
    - The church's mission is to foster the growth of God-consciousness in the world.
    - The visible and invisible church together anticipate the final consummation.
    - "The church is the community in which the divine life is most fully realized." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Rejection of Apocalyptic Dualism**
    - Opposes a sharp dualism between the present world and the world to come.
    - Emphasizes the unity of creation and redemption under divine providence.
    - The new heavens and new earth are not a replacement but a fulfillment of creation.
    - Eschatology is integrated with anthropology and ethics, not speculative cosmology.
    - "The consummation is not a catastrophe, but the completion of the divine purpose in history." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **eschatology** profoundly shaped modern liberal theology, shifting the focus from apocalyptic expectation to ethical and spiritual fulfillment. His emphasis on the **church** as the locus of the new creation influenced later Protestant thought, especially in the development of **process theology** and existentialist approaches. While his views diverged from traditional doctrines of the **new heavens and new earth**, they opened new avenues for understanding Christian hope in terms of historical and communal transformation. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the meaning of eschatological promise in contemporary theology.
