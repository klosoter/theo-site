# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge approached the doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth** within the broader framework of **Reformed eschatology**, emphasizing the continuity between the present creation and its future renewal. He maintained that the final state involves the **restoration of creation**, where the effects of the Fall are reversed, and the redeemed enjoy eternal fellowship with God in a glorified cosmos.

- "The future kingdom of Christ is to be on this renewed and glorified earth." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (especially chapters on Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust articulation of the **new heavens and new earth** shaped later Reformed understandings of eschatology, emphasizing the goodness of creation and the hope of its restoration. His insistence on the continuity between the present world and its future renewal provided a theological foundation for engaging culture and creation care. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary discussions on the relationship between redemption and the created order, reinforcing the biblical vision of a consummated, glorified cosmos.
