# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the radical discontinuity between the present fallen order and the eschatological fulfillment of **God’s Kingdom**. He rejected both utopian progressivism and purely spiritualized eschatology, insisting that the **resurrection** and **renewal of creation** are rooted in the sovereign act of God, culminating in a transformed reality that transcends human history.

- "The Christian hope is not for the immortality of the soul, but for the resurrection of the body and the renewal of all creation." (Eternal Hope)

## Key Works

- Eternal Hope (1946)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- Man in Revolt (1937)
- The Mediator (1934)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Fulfillment as Divine Act**
    - The **new creation** is not a human achievement but the result of God’s sovereign intervention.
    - Brunner opposes any identification of the Kingdom with historical progress or ethical improvement.
    - The consummation of history is a radical new beginning, not a mere extension of the present.
    - Human history is judged and transcended in the eschaton.
    - "The Kingdom of God comes not as the product of human effort, but as the gift of God’s creative power." (Eternal Hope)

2. **Resurrection of the Body**
    - The Christian hope centers on the **bodily resurrection**, not the immortality of the soul.
    - Brunner insists on the continuity and discontinuity between the present body and the resurrected body.
    - The resurrection is a sign of God’s faithfulness to the whole person, body and soul.
    - The new creation involves the transformation of material existence.
    - "The resurrection is the pledge of the new creation, the renewal of all things." (Eternal Hope)

3. **Renewal of Creation**
    - Brunner affirms the **redemption of creation** as integral to Christian hope.
    - The new heavens and new earth represent the fulfillment of God’s original purpose for the world.
    - Creation is not abandoned but renewed and perfected in Christ.
    - The eschatological future is cosmic in scope, not merely individual.
    - "The world is not to be destroyed, but transformed and made new." (Dogmatics II)

4. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - The work of **Jesus Christ** is central to the hope of the new creation.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the firstfruits and guarantee of the coming renewal.
    - The eschaton is inseparable from the person and work of Christ.
    - The new creation is realized only in union with Christ.
    - "In Christ, the new world has already dawned, though it is not yet consummated." (The Mediator)

5. **Tension Between Already and Not Yet**
    - Brunner emphasizes the **provisional** character of the present age.
    - The new creation is anticipated in faith but not yet fully realized.
    - Believers live in hope, marked by both assurance and longing.
    - The church is a sign and foretaste of the coming reality.
    - "We live between the times, awaiting the fulfillment of God’s promise." (Eternal Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s eschatology challenged both liberal optimism and existential despair by grounding the **new heavens and new earth** in the sovereign, gracious action of God. His emphasis on the **resurrection of the body** and the renewal of creation influenced later discussions on the cosmic scope of redemption. While sometimes overshadowed by Barth, Brunner’s dialectical approach remains significant for those seeking a robust, Christ-centered eschatological hope that avoids both secular utopianism and spiritual escapism.
