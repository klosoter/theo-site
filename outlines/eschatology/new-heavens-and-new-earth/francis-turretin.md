# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin affirmed the **future renewal of creation** in the doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth**, emphasizing the continuity and transformation of the present cosmos rather than its annihilation. He situated this hope within the broader Reformed eschatological framework, connecting it to the **resurrection**, the **final judgment**, and the consummation of **God’s covenant promises**.

- "The world will not be annihilated, but renewed and purified by fire, so that it may be adapted to the state of glory." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 20.8.10)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 3, Topics 20–21)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on Eschatology (various disputations within the Institutes)
- Willem van Asselt, "Francis Turretin and the Reformed Doctrine of the New Creation" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuity and Renewal of Creation**
    - The **new heavens and new earth** will be a renewal, not a replacement, of the present world.
    - Turretin rejects the idea of total annihilation; instead, he teaches **purification by fire**.
    - The substance of creation remains, but its qualities are gloriously transformed.
    - This renewal fulfills God’s original purpose for creation, now free from the effects of the Fall.
    - "The world will be cleansed from all corruption and restored to a better state." (Institutes, 20.8.10)

2. **Eschatological Fulfillment of Covenant Promises**
    - The new creation is the consummation of **God’s covenant** with His people.
    - Turretin links the promise of a renewed earth to the Abrahamic and New Covenants.
    - The inheritance of the saints is both spiritual and physical, realized in the new creation.
    - The new heavens and earth are the ultimate context for eternal blessedness.
    - "The inheritance promised to Abraham and his seed is not only spiritual, but also includes the renewed earth." (Institutes, 20.8.12)

3. **Resurrection and Cosmic Restoration**
    - The **resurrection of the body** is inseparably connected to the renewal of the cosmos.
    - Both humanity and creation are restored together at the **consummation**.
    - The glorified state of believers corresponds to the glorified state of creation.
    - The restoration is comprehensive, affecting all aspects of the created order.
    - "As the bodies of the saints will be glorified, so also the world itself will be renewed." (Institutes, 20.8.11)

4. **Judgment and Purification by Fire**
    - The **final judgment** is accompanied by a purifying conflagration, not total destruction.
    - Fire serves as God’s instrument to remove sin and corruption from creation.
    - The elements are transformed, not annihilated, in preparation for the eternal state.
    - This purification is analogous to the refining of gold, not its obliteration.
    - "The fire of the last day will purify, not destroy, the substance of the world." (Institutes, 20.8.10)

5. **Christological Center of New Creation**
    - Christ is the agent and goal of the new creation.
    - The work of **redemption** extends to the entire cosmos, not just individual souls.
    - The new heavens and earth manifest the fullness of Christ’s victory over sin and death.
    - The glorified creation is the eternal dwelling place of Christ and His people.
    - "Christ, as the second Adam, restores not only mankind but also the world itself." (Institutes, 20.8.13)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s robust articulation of the **new heavens and new earth** shaped later Reformed eschatology, emphasizing the continuity of creation and the cosmic scope of redemption. His careful distinction between annihilation and renewal influenced confessional statements and subsequent theologians, reinforcing the hope of a restored, glorified creation. Turretin’s synthesis of **covenant theology** and eschatology continues to inform contemporary Reformed discussions on the destiny of the cosmos.
