# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the doctrine of the **new heavens and new earth** through the lens of **Reformed eschatology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the consummation of **redemptive history** as the restoration and fulfillment of God’s original purpose for creation, insisting that the final state is not a mere return to Eden but the realization of the **covenantal kingdom** in its fullest, Christ-centered form.

- "The consummation of history is the full realization of the kingdom of God in the new heavens and the new earth." (The Defense of the Faith)

1. **Redemptive History Culminates in Consummation**
    - The **new heavens and new earth** are the telos of God’s redemptive plan.
    - History is linear, moving from creation, through fall and redemption, to consummation.
    - The final state is not static but the dynamic fulfillment of God’s covenantal promises.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the guarantee and pattern of the new creation.
    - "History moves toward the consummation of all things in Christ." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Continuity and Discontinuity with Present Creation**
    - The new creation is both continuous with and transformed from the present order.
    - Sin and its effects are fully eradicated, but the goodness of creation is preserved.
    - The material world is not discarded but renewed for God’s glory.
    - The eschatological hope affirms the value of creation and culture.
    - "The new earth is not a negation but a transformation of the old." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Covenantal Kingdom Realized**
    - The **covenant** is the organizing principle of God’s dealings with creation.
    - The new heavens and new earth are the final realization of the covenantal kingdom.
    - God’s sovereignty and faithfulness are displayed in bringing creation to its intended goal.
    - The people of God dwell eternally in communion with Him under Christ’s lordship.
    - "The covenant finds its ultimate fulfillment in the new heavens and the new earth." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - Christ is the center and agent of the new creation.
    - The resurrection inaugurates the new age, guaranteeing its future consummation.
    - Believers’ union with Christ ensures participation in the renewed cosmos.
    - All things are summed up in Christ, who reconciles creation to God.
    - "In Christ, the new creation has already begun." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Antithesis and the Final Victory of God**
    - The antithesis between belief and unbelief is resolved in the final state.
    - Evil is definitively judged and excluded from the new creation.
    - The new heavens and new earth manifest the triumph of God’s truth and righteousness.
    - The consummation vindicates the presuppositional necessity of the Christian worldview.
    - "The final victory of God is the establishment of his kingdom in the new heavens and the new earth." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robustly **Reformed eschatology** shaped generations of theologians and apologists, especially within the Westminster tradition. His insistence on the **covenantal structure** of redemptive history and the centrality of Christ in the consummation of all things provided a framework for integrating eschatology with apologetics. Van Til’s influence endures in discussions of the relationship between creation, redemption, and the final state, reinforcing the hope of a renewed cosmos under the lordship of Christ.
