# Richard J. Bauckham (1946– )

Richard J. Bauckham emphasizes the **biblical vision of the new heavens and new earth** as a holistic renewal of all creation, not merely the salvation of individual souls. He stresses the continuity between the present world and its eschatological transformation, highlighting the **cosmic scope of redemption** and the **restoration of creation** in Christ.

- "The biblical hope is not for escape from the world, but for the world’s transformation into the new creation." ("Bible and Ecology")

## Key Works

- "The Theology of the Book of Revelation" (1993)
- "Bible and Ecology: Rediscovering the Community of Creation" (2010)
- "The Bible and the Future of the Earth" (2011)
- "Jesus and the Eyewitnesses" (2006) [for broader theological context]
- "Living with Other Creatures: Green Exegesis and Theology" (2011)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cosmic Redemption in Christ**
   - Redemption encompasses all of **creation**, not just humanity.
   - The **new heavens and new earth** fulfill God’s original purpose for the world.
   - Christ’s resurrection is the firstfruits of the **new creation**.
   - The eschatological renewal is both physical and spiritual.
   - "The scope of salvation is as wide as creation itself." ("Bible and Ecology")

2. **Continuity and Discontinuity**
   - The new creation involves both continuity with and transformation of the present world.
   - Evil and corruption are purged, but the goodness of creation is preserved.
   - The imagery in **Revelation 21–22** points to renewal, not annihilation.
   - Human and non-human creation share in the eschatological hope.
   - "God does not abandon his creation but brings it to its intended fulfillment." ("Theology of the Book of Revelation")

3. **Ecological Responsibility**
   - The future hope of the new earth grounds present ecological ethics.
   - Human stewardship anticipates the coming **restoration of all things**.
   - The church is called to witness to God’s purpose for creation.
   - Eschatology motivates care for the earth, not escapism.
   - "Christian hope for the new creation should inspire responsible action for the present creation." ("Bible and Ecology")

4. **Biblical-Theological Integration**
   - The **new heavens and new earth** theme unites Old and New Testament eschatology.
   - Isaiah, Romans, and Revelation are key texts for this doctrine.
   - The **kingdom of God** is ultimately realized in the renewed creation.
   - The biblical narrative moves from creation to new creation.
   - "The whole biblical story moves towards the renewal of all things." ("Bible and Ecology")

5. **Worship and the New Creation**
   - Worship anticipates and participates in the reality of the new creation.
   - The liturgy of Revelation envisions all creatures praising God.
   - Eschatological worship is communal and cosmic in scope.
   - The church’s praise is a foretaste of the **eschatological consummation**.
   - "Worship in Revelation is the worship of the whole creation redeemed." ("Theology of the Book of Revelation")

## Legacy and Impact

Bauckham’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the **theology of creation** and the **eschatological renewal of the cosmos**. His integration of ecological concerns with biblical eschatology has influenced both academic theology and Christian environmental ethics. Bauckham’s emphasis on the cosmic scope of redemption challenges reductionistic views of salvation and has encouraged a more holistic understanding of the **new heavens and new earth** within the church and academy.
