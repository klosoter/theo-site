# Oscar Cullmann (1902–1999)

Oscar Cullmann emphasized the **continuity between creation and redemption**, arguing that the **new heavens and new earth** represent the consummation and transformation of the present world rather than its annihilation. He situated this hope within a **linear, salvation-historical framework**, stressing the bodily **resurrection** and the ultimate victory of Christ over death as central to Christian eschatology.

- "The final goal is not the abolition of the cosmos, but its transformation and renewal." (Christ and Time)

## Key Works

- Christ and Time: The Primitive Christian Conception of Time and History
- Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?
- Salvation in History
- The Christology of the New Testament

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Linear Salvation History**
    - Views history as a line with a definite beginning and end, not a cyclical process.
    - The **new creation** is the final act in God’s redemptive plan.
    - Emphasizes the historical reality of Christ’s resurrection as the turning point.
    - The present age and the age to come are distinct but connected.
    - "Primitive Christianity knows nothing of a cyclical view of history; it is dominated by the expectation of a final goal." (Christ and Time)

2. **Transformation, Not Annihilation, of Creation**
    - The **new heavens and new earth** are a renewal of the existing cosmos.
    - Rejects the idea that salvation means escape from the material world.
    - Stresses the continuity between the old and new creation.
    - The resurrection body is a model for cosmic transformation.
    - "The world is not to be destroyed, but transformed and renewed." (Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?)

3. **Centrality of Bodily Resurrection**
    - Resurrection is physical, not merely spiritual or immaterial.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits of the new creation.
    - The hope for believers is resurrection into a renewed creation.
    - Denies the Greek notion of the immortality of the soul as the Christian hope.
    - "The New Testament hope is not for the immortality of the soul, but for the resurrection of the body." (Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?)

4. **Christ’s Victory as Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the new creation.
    - The final consummation awaits Christ’s return.
    - The defeat of death is both present and future in its effects.
    - The new heavens and new earth are the ultimate realization of Christ’s work.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new world." (Christ and Time)

5. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - The new creation is inaugurated but not yet fully realized.
    - Believers live in the tension between the present age and the age to come.
    - The church is a sign and foretaste of the new creation.
    - Full transformation awaits the parousia.
    - "The new creation has already begun, but its completion lies in the future." (Salvation in History)

## Legacy and Impact

Cullmann’s emphasis on **salvation history** and the transformation of creation challenged both existentialist and dualistic interpretations of eschatology. His work influenced later biblical theology by rooting Christian hope in the **bodily resurrection** and the renewal of the cosmos. Cullmann’s insistence on the continuity between creation and redemption has shaped contemporary discussions on the **new heavens and new earth**, especially in dialogue with Reformed and ecumenical theology.
