# Thomas Schreiner (1954– )

Thomas Schreiner argues that **Romans 11** teaches a future, large-scale **salvation of ethnic Israel** within the unfolding of **redemptive history**. He maintains that Paul envisions a time when **Israel**, as a corporate entity, will experience **restoration** through faith in **Jesus the Messiah**, while still upholding the unity of **Jew and Gentile** in the **one people of God**.

- "Paul predicts a future salvation of ethnic Israel as a group, though not necessarily every individual Jew, when the fullness of the Gentiles has come in." ("Romans," Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Paul, Apostle of God’s Glory in Christ (2001)
- The Law and Its Fulfillment: A Pauline Theology of Law (1993)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Future Salvation of Ethnic Israel**
    - Romans 11:26 refers to a future event involving the salvation of a significant number of ethnic Jews.
    - This salvation is not merely individual but has a corporate, national dimension.
    - The "fullness of the Gentiles" precedes Israel’s turning to Christ.
    - The promise is rooted in God’s irrevocable covenant with Israel.
    - "Paul teaches that a significant number of Jews will be saved in the future, fulfilling God’s promises to Israel." (Romans, BECNT)

2. **Unity of Jew and Gentile in Christ**
    - The church is the one people of God, composed of both Jews and Gentiles.
    - Israel’s future salvation does not entail a separate redemptive plan.
    - Gentile inclusion provokes Israel to jealousy, leading to their salvation.
    - The olive tree metaphor emphasizes continuity and unity.
    - "There is one people of God, and both Jews and Gentiles are saved through faith in Christ." (Romans, BECNT)

3. **Faith in Christ as the Means of Salvation**
    - Salvation for Jews, as for Gentiles, comes only through faith in Jesus.
    - There is no separate covenantal path for Israel apart from Christ.
    - Paul’s hope for Israel is explicitly Christological.
    - The "deliverer from Zion" is identified as Jesus the Messiah.
    - "All Israel will be saved, but only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah." (Romans, BECNT)

4. **Irrevocability of God’s Promises**
    - God’s election and calling of Israel are described as irrevocable.
    - The faithfulness of God undergirds Paul’s hope for Israel’s future.
    - The fulfillment of these promises is eschatological, not merely historical.
    - God’s mercy is displayed in both judgment and restoration.
    - "The gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable." (Romans 11:29, BECNT)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective**
    - Romans 11 must be read within the broader sweep of salvation history.
    - The hardening of Israel is temporary and serves a purpose in God’s plan.
    - Gentile salvation is a catalyst for Israel’s eventual restoration.
    - The ultimate goal is the magnification of God’s mercy to all.
    - "God’s plan unfolds in stages, culminating in mercy to both Jews and Gentiles." (Romans, BECNT)

## Legacy and Impact

Schreiner’s exegesis of **Romans 11** has shaped evangelical discussions on the relationship between **Israel and the church**, especially within Reformed and Baptist circles. His careful attention to the text and emphasis on **redemptive-historical continuity** have influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to eschatology. Schreiner’s work remains a standard reference for those seeking a balanced, text-driven understanding of Israel’s future in Pauline theology.
