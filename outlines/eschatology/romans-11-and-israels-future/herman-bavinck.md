# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck approached **Romans 11** with a robust commitment to the unity of **redemptive history** and the enduring significance of **Israel** within the unfolding plan of **God’s covenant**. He affirmed that while the **church** now comprises both Jew and Gentile, Paul’s teaching in Romans 11 points to a future **conversion of Israel** as part of God’s faithfulness to his promises, without undermining the centrality of Christ or the continuity of the covenant of grace.

- "The apostle expects a future conversion of Israel, not merely of individuals, but of the people as a whole." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced reading of **Romans 11** has shaped Reformed discussions on the relationship between **Israel and the church**, influencing both covenant theology and eschatology. His insistence on the future conversion of Israel, grounded in the unity of the covenant of grace, has provided a mediating position between supersessionism and dispensationalism. Bavinck’s work continues to inform contemporary debates on the place of Israel in redemptive history and the ongoing relevance of Paul’s teaching for the doctrine of the church.
