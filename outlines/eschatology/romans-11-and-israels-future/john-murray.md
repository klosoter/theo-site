# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a robustly exegetical and theologically nuanced reading of **Romans 11**, arguing that Paul teaches a future, large-scale **conversion of ethnic Israel** as part of the unfolding of **redemptive history**. Murray maintained that this expectation is grounded in the **covenant faithfulness of God**, the irrevocability of the **divine promises**, and the organic unity of **Jew and Gentile** in the **one people of God**.

- "The salvation of Israel is to be regarded as a mass conversion of the Jewish people, corresponding in its suddenness and completeness to the conversion of the Gentiles in the apostolic age." (The Epistle to the Romans, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT), Vol. 2 (Romans 9–16)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Select Lectures in Systematic Theology
- "The Covenant of Grace" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "The Unity of the Church" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Future Conversion of Ethnic Israel**
    - Interprets Romans 11:25–26 as predicting a future, large-scale turning of ethnic Israel to Christ.
    - Rejects purely spiritual or ecclesiological readings that dissolve Israel’s identity into the church.
    - Sees this conversion as a distinct event in redemptive history, not merely a gradual process.
    - Grounds this hope in Paul’s argument about the mystery of God’s plan.
    - "The context requires that 'all Israel' be understood of ethnic Israel in contrast with the Gentiles." (Romans, Vol. 2)

2. **Irrevocability of Divine Promises**
    - Emphasizes that God’s promises to Israel are rooted in His unchanging faithfulness.
    - Argues that the gifts and calling of God are “without repentance” (Romans 11:29).
    - Connects the future of Israel to the Abrahamic and covenantal promises.
    - Maintains that God’s fidelity undergirds the certainty of Israel’s future salvation.
    - "The perpetuity of Israel as a people is bound up with the faithfulness of God to his covenant." (Romans, Vol. 2)

3. **Organic Unity of Jew and Gentile**
    - Stresses the metaphor of the olive tree to show the unity of God’s people.
    - Argues that Gentile inclusion does not replace but enriches the people of God.
    - Sees the future conversion of Israel as leading to greater fullness for the church.
    - Maintains that salvation is always by union with Christ, for Jew and Gentile alike.
    - "There is one olive tree, and both Jews and Gentiles partake of the same root and fatness." (Romans, Vol. 2)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective**
    - Reads Romans 11 within the broader sweep of salvation history.
    - Views Israel’s hardening and future restoration as stages in God’s redemptive plan.
    - Connects Paul’s teaching to Old Testament prophecy and eschatological expectation.
    - Emphasizes the unfolding mystery revealed in Christ and the gospel.
    - "The history of redemption is not complete apart from the restoration of Israel." (Romans, Vol. 2)

5. **Opposition to Replacement Theology**
    - Explicitly rejects the idea that the church has superseded Israel in God’s purposes.
    - Argues for a continuing role for ethnic Israel in the eschatological future.
    - Warns against Gentile arrogance and presumption (Romans 11:18–21).
    - Affirms the abiding significance of Israel in the outworking of God’s plan.
    - "Paul’s warning to the Gentiles is a warning against the error of replacement." (Romans, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s exegesis of **Romans 11** has profoundly shaped Reformed and evangelical understandings of Israel’s future, providing a careful alternative to both **supersessionism** and dispensationalism. His insistence on the **covenant faithfulness of God** and the organic unity of Jew and Gentile continues to influence contemporary discussions on biblical theology and eschatology. Murray’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a nuanced, exegetically grounded approach to Israel’s place in redemptive history.
