# O. Palmer Robertson (1937– )

O. Palmer Robertson approaches **Romans 11** and the question of **Israel’s future** from a distinctly **Reformed covenantal** perspective. He emphasizes the unity of the **people of God** across redemptive history, interpreting Paul’s teaching as pointing to the inclusion of both **Jew and Gentile** in the one **covenant community** through faith in Christ, rather than a separate future for ethnic Israel.

- "The church is the Israel of God, composed of believing Jews and Gentiles alike." ("The Israel of God: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant Unity of God’s People**
    - Argues that **Romans 11** must be read in light of the overarching unity of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Sees the church as the continuation and fulfillment of **Old Testament Israel**.
    - Emphasizes that all who are in Christ, Jew or Gentile, are heirs of the promises.
    - Rejects the notion of a separate redemptive destiny for ethnic Israel apart from the church.
    - "There is one people of God, and that people is defined by faith in Christ." (The Israel of God)

2. **Interpretation of “All Israel”**
    - Interprets "all Israel will be saved" (Romans 11:26) as referring to the full number of the elect, both Jew and Gentile.
    - Argues against a future mass conversion of ethnic Israel as a distinct event.
    - Views Paul’s language as covenantal and corporate, not strictly ethnic or national.
    - Maintains that salvation is always through union with Christ, not ethnicity.
    - "Paul’s concern is for the salvation of the covenant community, not for a future nationalistic restoration." (The Israel of God)

3. **Rejection of Dispensational Distinctions**
    - Critiques **dispensationalism** for positing two separate peoples and destinies.
    - Emphasizes the continuity of God’s redemptive plan through the covenants.
    - Argues that the promises to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and extended to all believers.
    - Sees no biblical warrant for a future restoration of national Israel apart from faith in Christ.
    - "The dispensational dichotomy between Israel and the church is foreign to Paul’s argument in Romans 11." (The Israel of God)

4. **Hermeneutic of Fulfillment**
    - Advocates a **typological** and **Christocentric** reading of Old Testament promises.
    - Believes that land and nation promises are fulfilled in the new covenant community.
    - Stresses that the New Testament reinterprets Old Testament categories in light of Christ.
    - Sees the ingathering of the Gentiles as the fulfillment of Israel’s mission.
    - "The promises to Israel find their yes and amen in Christ and his body, the church." (The Christ of the Covenants)

5. **Ongoing Gospel Call to Jews**
    - Affirms that Jewish people continue to be called to faith in Christ.
    - Rejects supersessionism that would exclude Jews from the gospel invitation.
    - Sees Paul’s anguish for Israel as a model for ongoing evangelism.
    - Maintains hope for the salvation of Jews as individuals within the one people of God.
    - "The gospel remains the power of God for salvation to the Jew first and also to the Greek." (The Israel of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Robertson’s **covenant theology** has significantly shaped Reformed approaches to Romans 11 and the question of Israel’s future. His arguments against **dispensationalism** and for the unity of the **covenant community** have influenced both academic and pastoral discussions on eschatology and ecclesiology. By emphasizing the fulfillment of Old Testament promises in Christ and the church, Robertson has provided a robust framework for understanding the relationship between Israel and the church in redemptive history. His work continues to be a standard reference in debates over the future of Israel within Reformed circles.
