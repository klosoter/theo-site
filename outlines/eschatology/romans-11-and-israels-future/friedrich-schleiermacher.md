# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher interpreted **Romans 11** and the question of **Israel’s future** through the lens of **religious consciousness** and the **universal scope of redemption**. He viewed Paul’s discussion not as a literal prophecy of national restoration, but as an expression of the ongoing relationship between the **church** and **Israel** within the unfolding history of **salvation**.

- "The apostle’s words concerning Israel must be understood in light of the universal calling of humanity to redemption." (Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Schleiermacher: Romans 9–11 (in various collected sermons and lectures)
- The Christian Faith and the Church (secondary discussions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Consciousness**
    - Emphasizes the feeling of absolute dependence as the core of **religion**.
    - Views Israel’s role in Romans 11 as illustrative of humanity’s universal relation to God.
    - Rejects a strictly historical or nationalistic reading of Israel’s future.
    - Sees Paul’s argument as pointing to the unity of **faith** rather than ethnic distinction.
    "The essence of religion is neither doctrine nor morality, but immediate self-consciousness." (Christian Faith)

2. **Universal Scope of Redemption**
    - Interprets Romans 11 as affirming the inclusion of all peoples in God’s **redemptive plan**.
    - Argues that the distinction between Jew and Gentile is ultimately overcome in **Christ**.
    - Stresses the progressive realization of **salvation** in history.
    - Sees Israel’s “fullness” as symbolic of the completion of the **church**.
    "All humanity is destined for redemption, and the distinction of Israel serves the universal purpose." (Christian Faith)

3. **Ecclesiology: The Church as the New Israel**
    - Identifies the **church** as the spiritual continuation of Israel.
    - Views the promises to Israel as fulfilled in the community of **faith**.
    - Downplays expectations of a future national restoration for ethnic Israel.
    - Emphasizes the unity and catholicity of the **church**.
    "The church is the true Israel, in which all the promises find their fulfillment." (Christian Faith)

4. **Historical Development of Revelation**
    - Sees **revelation** as unfolding progressively through history.
    - Interprets Paul’s references to Israel’s future as part of a larger historical process.
    - Regards the “mystery” in Romans 11 as the gradual inclusion of all peoples.
    - Rejects a static or literalistic reading of **prophecy**.
    "Revelation is not a single event, but a process in the life of humanity." (Christian Faith)

5. **Christocentric Hermeneutic**
    - Reads Romans 11 through the lens of **Christ’s universal significance**.
    - Argues that **Christ** is the fulfillment of all Old Testament promises.
    - Sees Israel’s role as preparatory for the coming of **Christ**.
    - Interprets Paul’s hope for Israel as hope for the world’s reconciliation in **Christ**.
    "In Christ, all distinctions are overcome, and the unity of humanity is realized." (Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s interpretation of **Romans 11** profoundly influenced modern **liberal theology**, shifting the focus from national Israel to the universal church and the inner experience of faith. His approach paved the way for later theological treatments that emphasize the **spiritual continuity** between Israel and the church, rather than a future ethnic restoration. While his views have been critiqued for minimizing the particularity of Israel, his emphasis on the **universal scope of redemption** remains a hallmark of his legacy. Schleiermacher’s hermeneutic continues to shape discussions on the relationship between **Christianity** and **Judaism** in contemporary theology.
