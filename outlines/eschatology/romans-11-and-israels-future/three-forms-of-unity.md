# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed** understanding of the church and **Israel** in relation to **Romans 11**. These confessions emphasize the unity of **God’s people** across redemptive history, interpreting Paul’s teaching on Israel’s future in light of **covenant theology** and the continuity between **Old and New Testament** believers. The future of Israel is seen as tied to God’s faithfulness to His covenant promises, with the church as the true continuation of Israel.

- "This article [of the Creed] teaches us that the church has existed from the beginning of the world and will be to the end thereof, which is evident from the fact that Christ is an eternal King, whom we must confess and worship." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as the Continuation of Israel**
    - The confessions teach that the **church** is the spiritual continuation of **Israel**, united by faith in Christ.
    - The visible church includes all who profess faith and their children, reflecting the covenantal structure of Israel.
    - The promises to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and extended to all nations through the gospel.
    - There is no sharp division between Israel and the church in God’s redemptive plan.
    - "This holy church is preserved by God against the rage of the whole world, though she sometimes appears very small." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

2. **Covenant Theology and Romans 11**
    - The confessions interpret Romans 11 through the lens of **covenant continuity**.
    - The olive tree metaphor is seen as the one people of God, with Jews and Gentiles grafted in by faith.
    - The future ingathering of Jews is anticipated as part of God’s ongoing covenant faithfulness.
    - The rejection and restoration of Israel are understood corporately, not as a separate dispensation.
    - "For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel." (Canons of Dort, I.10)

3. **Election and the Remnant**
    - The confessions stress **unconditional election** as the basis for inclusion in God’s people.
    - Romans 11’s remnant motif is applied to both Jews and Gentiles, emphasizing God’s sovereign grace.
    - The perseverance of the elect is guaranteed, regardless of national or ethnic identity.
    - The future of Israel is tied to God’s electing purpose, not ethnic privilege.
    - "Election is the unchangeable purpose of God whereby, before the foundation of the world, He hath out of mere grace chosen...a certain number of persons to redemption in Christ." (Canons of Dort, I.7)

4. **Unity of the Old and New Covenants**
    - The confessions maintain that the **substance of the covenant** is the same in both testaments.
    - The sacraments of the Old Testament (circumcision, Passover) are fulfilled in those of the New (baptism, Lord’s Supper).
    - The promises made to Abraham and Israel are realized in Christ and the church.
    - Romans 11 is read as affirming this unity, not as predicting a separate future for ethnic Israel.
    - "The washing away of sins is promised as much to our children as to us." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 74)

5. **Hope for Israel’s Future**
    - The confessions allow for a future conversion of Jews, as implied in Romans 11.
    - This hope is not for a separate dispensation but for their inclusion in the one people of God.
    - The restoration of Israel is seen as a sign of God’s mercy and faithfulness to His promises.
    - The church is called to pray for and witness to the Jewish people.
    - "We must pray for the conversion of all men, including the Jews, that they may be grafted in again." (cf. Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 123)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped **Reformed ecclesiology** and the interpretation of Romans 11 within confessional traditions. Their emphasis on the unity of God’s people, covenant continuity, and the hope for Israel’s future has influenced subsequent Reformed theology and ecumenical dialogue. These confessions continue to serve as foundational documents for understanding the relationship between Israel and the church, especially in debates over eschatology and covenant theology.
