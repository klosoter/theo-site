# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, addressed the question of **Israel’s future** in the context of **Romans 11** with careful attention to the continuity and discontinuity between the **Old and New Covenants**. He affirmed the enduring significance of ethnic Israel while upholding the unity of the **covenant of grace**, arguing that the **promises to Israel** find their ultimate fulfillment in Christ and the church, yet also allowing for a future large-scale conversion of Jews. Turretin’s nuanced exegesis sought to balance the particularity of Israel with the universality of the gospel.

- "The apostle does not speak of the conversion of every individual Jew, but of the conversion of the people as a body, after the fullness of the Gentiles has come in." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 8.24.14)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 2, Topics 8 and 24)
- Commentarius in Epistolam ad Romanos (Commentary on Romans; manuscript and referenced in secondary literature)
- Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism" (for context on Turretin’s method)
- Richard Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (for analysis of Turretin’s covenant theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Turretin maintained that the **covenant of grace** is one in substance throughout redemptive history.
    - The inclusion of Gentiles does not annul the promises made to Israel but fulfills them in Christ.
    - The church is the continuation and expansion of the people of God, incorporating both Jews and Gentiles.
    - The spiritual blessings promised to Abraham are realized in the New Testament community.
    - "The covenant made with the fathers was not abolished, but fulfilled and perfected in Christ." (Institutes, 12.1.7)

2. **Distinction Between National and Spiritual Israel**
    - Turretin distinguished between **ethnic Israel** and the **spiritual Israel** composed of true believers.
    - Not all who are descended from Israel belong to the true Israel, as Paul teaches in Romans 9–11.
    - The promises to Israel have a spiritual core, ultimately centered in union with Christ.
    - Yet, the national identity of Israel retains a role in God’s redemptive plan.
    - "There is a twofold Israel: one according to the flesh, the other according to the promise." (Institutes, 8.24.14)

3. **Future Conversion of the Jews**
    - Turretin interpreted Romans 11 as teaching a future, large-scale conversion of ethnic Jews.
    - This conversion will occur after the "fullness of the Gentiles" has come in.
    - He rejected the idea of a total restoration of the Jewish nation as a political entity.
    - The conversion is spiritual, not nationalistic, and is part of the ongoing ingathering of the elect.
    - "Paul predicts a future calling of the Jews, not their restoration to their former polity." (Institutes, 8.24.14)

4. **Rejection of Chiliasm (Millenarianism)**
    - Turretin opposed **chiliasm**, the belief in a literal thousand-year reign of Christ centered on a restored Israel.
    - He argued that the kingdom of Christ is spiritual and present in the church.
    - The hope for Israel is not earthly dominion but participation in the blessings of the Messiah.
    - The fulfillment of prophecy is found in the gospel’s advance, not in a revived Jewish state.
    - "The kingdom of Christ is not of this world, nor is it to be confined to the Jewish nation." (Institutes, 8.24.15)

5. **Hermeneutic of Promise and Fulfillment**
    - Turretin employed a typological and Christocentric reading of Old Testament promises.
    - The **promises to Israel** are fulfilled in Christ and extended to all believers.
    - He affirmed the reliability of God’s word to Israel, insisting on both continuity and transformation in fulfillment.
    - Romans 11 is read as both a warning and a hope for the church regarding God’s faithfulness.
    - "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance, but their fulfillment is in Christ and his body." (Institutes, 8.24.14)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s treatment of **Romans 11 and Israel’s future** shaped later Reformed exegesis and covenant theology, providing a careful balance between the particularity of Israel and the universality of the church. His rejection of chiliasm and insistence on the unity of the **covenant of grace** influenced generations of Reformed theologians. Turretin’s nuanced approach continues to inform contemporary discussions on the place of Israel in redemptive history, especially within confessional Reformed circles. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold both the faithfulness of God to his promises and the centrality of Christ in all of Scripture.
