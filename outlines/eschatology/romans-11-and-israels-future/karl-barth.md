# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s interpretation of **Romans 11** is deeply shaped by his commitment to the **sovereignty of God**, the **faithfulness of God to Israel**, and the **eschatological mystery** of salvation history. Barth resists both supersessionism and simple restorationism, emphasizing the ongoing significance of **Israel** within the **covenant** and the **universal scope of election** in Christ.

- "Israel is the people with whom God has entered into covenant, and this covenant is not abolished but fulfilled in Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

## Key Works

- The Epistle to the Romans (especially the commentary on Romans 9–11)
- Church Dogmatics II/2 (Doctrine of Election)
- Church Dogmatics IV/1 (Doctrine of Reconciliation)
- "The Church and Israel" (in Community, State, and Church)
- Karl Barth and the Future of the Church (secondary, ed. Trevor Hart)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Irrevocable Covenant with Israel**
    - God’s election of Israel remains a decisive act in salvation history.
    - The covenant is not nullified by Israel’s unbelief but is fulfilled in Christ.
    - Israel’s role is unique and non-transferable within the divine purpose.
    - The church does not replace Israel but participates in the covenant through Christ.
    - "God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

2. **Universal Scope of Election in Christ**
    - Election is centered in Jesus Christ as the Elect One.
    - Both Jews and Gentiles are included in God’s saving purpose.
    - Israel’s partial hardening serves the inclusion of the Gentiles.
    - The mystery of salvation is ultimately universal in scope, though not universalistic.
    - "In Jesus Christ, God has chosen all humanity." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

3. **Eschatological Mystery of Israel’s Salvation**
    - The future of Israel is a divine mystery, not fully revealed.
    - Barth affirms hope for Israel’s ultimate salvation without presumption.
    - The “fullness” of Israel and the Gentiles is an eschatological event.
    - Human understanding is limited; God’s faithfulness will be manifest at the end.
    - "The future of Israel is hidden in the mystery of God’s own faithfulness." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

4. **Rejection of Supersessionism**
    - The church does not supersede or replace Israel in God’s plan.
    - Israel and the church coexist within the unfolding of God’s covenant.
    - The promises to Israel are not abrogated but fulfilled in Christ.
    - Barth warns against Christian triumphalism over Israel.
    - "The Church can never say: I am Israel." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

5. **Christological Fulfillment of the Covenant**
    - Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of God’s promises to Israel.
    - The covenant reaches its climax in the person and work of Christ.
    - Israel’s history finds its meaning in relation to Christ.
    - The church’s identity is rooted in its participation in Christ, not in replacing Israel.
    - "In Christ, the covenant with Israel is established for all." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s reading of **Romans 11** has profoundly shaped modern Christian understandings of **Israel’s ongoing theological significance**. His rejection of supersessionism and emphasis on the **mystery of election** have influenced post-Holocaust theology and ecumenical dialogue. Barth’s nuanced approach continues to challenge both Reformed and broader Christian traditions to reconsider the relationship between the church and Israel in light of God’s faithfulness.
