# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches **Romans 11** and the question of **Israel’s future** from a **Reformed**, **covenantal** perspective, emphasizing the unity of God’s redemptive plan and the enduring significance of **ethnic Israel** within the **one people of God**. He teaches that God’s promises to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and extended to all believers, while still anticipating a future ingathering of Jews into the covenant community.

- "God’s promises to Israel are not abrogated, but fulfilled in Christ and extended to all who believe, Jew and Gentile alike." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Key Works

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant Unity of God’s People**
    - Emphasizes the continuity of **God’s covenant** from Old to New Testament.
    - Sees the church as the fulfillment of Israel, yet recognizes a future for **ethnic Israel**.
    - Argues that Gentile inclusion does not nullify God’s promises to the Jews.
    - Maintains that all believers are grafted into the same **covenantal olive tree**.
    "The church is not a replacement for Israel, but its continuation and fulfillment." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Fulfillment in Christ**
    - Asserts that all of God’s promises to Israel find their ultimate fulfillment in **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ is the true Israel, and all who are united to Him share in the promises.
    - The salvation of Jews and Gentiles alike is only through union with Christ.
    - The future of Israel is inseparable from faith in the Messiah.
    "All the promises of God find their Yes in him." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

3. **Partial Hardening and Future Restoration**
    - Interprets Romans 11 as teaching a temporary hardening of Israel for the sake of Gentile salvation.
    - Expects a future ingathering of **ethnic Jews** into the church.
    - This restoration is not apart from faith in Christ but through it.
    - The “fullness of the Gentiles” precedes a widespread Jewish turning to Christ.
    "Paul anticipates a future turning of Israel to Christ, but always within the context of faith." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Warning Against Presumption**
    - Romans 11 serves as a warning to Gentile believers against arrogance.
    - The same principle of faith applies to both Jews and Gentiles.
    - God’s kindness and severity are displayed in His dealings with both groups.
    - Perseverance in faith is necessary for remaining in the **covenant community**.
    "Do not become proud, but fear; for if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Mission and Evangelism to Jews**
    - The future hope for Israel motivates ongoing evangelism to Jews.
    - The church is called to provoke Israel to jealousy by its faithfulness.
    - Jewish evangelism is grounded in the certainty of God’s promises.
    - The salvation of Israel is part of the church’s **missional mandate**.
    "The church’s mission includes a special concern for the salvation of ethnic Israel." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s interpretation of **Romans 11** has reinforced a robustly **covenantal** and Christ-centered approach within Reformed theology, balancing the unity of God’s people with the particularity of Israel’s role in redemptive history. His work has shaped contemporary discussions on the relationship between the church and Israel, especially regarding the future of ethnic Jews. Frame’s influence is evident in ongoing debates about **covenant theology**, ecclesiology, and the mission of the church to both Jews and Gentiles.
