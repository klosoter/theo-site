# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **Romans 11** and the question of **Israel’s future** through the lens of **Reformed covenant theology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the unity of **redemptive history** in Christ, viewing the promises to Israel as fulfilled in the **covenant community** rather than in a separate national destiny. For Van Til, the future of Israel is inseparable from the unfolding of God’s plan in the church, grounded in the continuity of the **covenant of grace**.

- "The church is the true Israel, and the promises made to Israel are realized in the church of Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Apologetics
- The Theology of James Daane (for Van Til’s critique of alternative views on Israel and the church)
- The New Hermeneutic (for Van Til’s approach to biblical interpretation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant Theology and the Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Emphasizes the continuity of the **covenant of grace** from Old to New Testament.
    - Sees the church as the fulfillment of the promises made to Israel.
    - Rejects any sharp dichotomy between Israel and the church in God’s redemptive plan.
    - Interprets Romans 11 within the broader context of God’s unified purpose in Christ.
    - "The covenant is one and the same throughout all history, though its administration may differ." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment of Promise**
    - Asserts that all Old Testament promises, including those to Israel, find their fulfillment in Christ.
    - Views Romans 11 as pointing to the ingrafting of Jews and Gentiles into one body.
    - Denies a future separate national restoration for ethnic Israel apart from Christ.
    - Stresses the centrality of Christ in interpreting prophecy and promise.
    - "All the promises of God are yea and amen in Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Presuppositional Approach to Hermeneutics**
    - Argues that interpretation of Romans 11 must begin with the presupposition of the authority of Scripture.
    - Rejects naturalistic or dispensational readings that separate Israel from the church.
    - Maintains that all exegesis must be grounded in a Reformed worldview.
    - Emphasizes the antithesis between belief and unbelief in understanding Israel’s place.
    - "There is no neutrality in interpretation; all is done from a covenantal perspective." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Corporate Election and the Remnant**
    - Interprets Romans 11’s discussion of Israel as referring to the elect remnant within Israel.
    - Stresses that salvation is always by grace, not ethnicity or works.
    - Sees the “fullness” of Israel as the completion of God’s elect from both Jews and Gentiles.
    - Rejects any notion of automatic salvation for national Israel.
    - "It is always the remnant according to the election of grace that constitutes true Israel." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Eschatological Hope in the Covenant Community**
    - Affirms a future ingathering of Jews into the church as part of God’s eschatological plan.
    - Denies a separate millennial destiny for Israel apart from the church.
    - Sees Romans 11 as a call to humility and mission for Gentile believers.
    - Grounds eschatological hope in the unity of the people of God.
    - "The hope of Israel is realized in the one people of God, united in Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **Romans 11** and Israel’s future has shaped Reformed thinking by reinforcing the unity of the **covenant community** and the centrality of Christ in biblical interpretation. His presuppositional method challenged dispensational and naturalistic readings, emphasizing the continuity of God’s redemptive plan. Van Til’s influence persists in contemporary Reformed hermeneutics and apologetics, particularly in discussions about the relationship between Israel and the church. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to a Christ-centered, covenantal reading of Scripture.
