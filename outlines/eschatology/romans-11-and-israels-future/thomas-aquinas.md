# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached **Romans 11** and the question of **Israel’s future** within the framework of **supersessionism**, interpreting the passage as affirming the enduring place of the **Jewish people** in salvation history, but ultimately fulfilled in the **Church** as the new Israel. He emphasized the **continuity of God’s promises** to Israel, while maintaining that the fullness of salvation is realized in Christ and the incorporation of both Jews and Gentiles into the **mystical body** of Christ.

- "The blindness of the Jews is not to be perpetual, but will be removed at the end of the world." (Commentary on Romans, ch. 11, lect. 3)

## Key Works

- Commentary on the Letter to the Romans (Super Epistolam ad Romanos Lectura)
- Summa Theologiae, especially III, q. 49–59 (on redemption and the Church)
- Catena Aurea (commentary on the Gospels, with relevant patristic citations)
- Selected Questions on the Old and New Law (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 98–105)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Promises to Israel Remain Valid**
    - God’s covenant with Israel is not revoked, but its fulfillment is found in Christ.
    - The **hardening** of Israel is partial and temporary, serving a providential purpose.
    - The eventual conversion of the Jews is anticipated at the end of the age.
    - The faithfulness of God’s promises is a demonstration of divine justice and mercy.
    - "For God hath not cast away his people, but reserved a remnant to be saved." (Commentary on Romans 11)

2. **Supersessionism and the Church as the New Israel**
    - The Church is the spiritual fulfillment of Israel, composed of both Jews and Gentiles.
    - The privileges of Israel are transferred to the Church through Christ.
    - The unity of the people of God is realized in the **mystical body** of Christ.
    - The Old Law prefigured the New, which is now the means of salvation.
    - "The Gentiles are made partakers of the root and fatness of the olive tree." (Commentary on Romans 11)

3. **Providential Hardening and Future Restoration**
    - Israel’s current unbelief is permitted by God for the salvation of the Gentiles.
    - This hardening is neither total nor final; a future restoration is foreseen.
    - The conversion of Israel will be a sign of the consummation of history.
    - The interplay of mercy and judgment reveals the depth of God’s wisdom.
    - "Blindness in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles should come in." (Commentary on Romans 11)

4. **Unity of Salvation in Christ**
    - Salvation is always through Christ, for both Jews and Gentiles.
    - The Law and the Prophets point to Christ as their fulfillment.
    - The distinction between Jew and Gentile is overcome in the new covenant.
    - The Church embodies the universal scope of redemption.
    - "All Israel shall be saved, not apart from faith in Christ, but by being grafted into Him." (Commentary on Romans 11)

5. **Typology and Fulfillment**
    - Old Testament Israel serves as a type of the Church.
    - The promises to Israel are fulfilled in a spiritual, not merely ethnic, sense.
    - The restoration of Israel is interpreted as their incorporation into the Church.
    - Typological reading underscores the unity of Scripture and salvation history.
    - "The calling of the Gentiles and the future conversion of the Jews are both mysteries of God’s providence." (Commentary on Romans 11)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s interpretation of **Romans 11** shaped subsequent Catholic and broader Christian understandings of **Israel’s role in salvation history**, reinforcing the doctrine of the Church as the true Israel while affirming the enduring significance of the Jewish people. His nuanced reading of **divine providence** and the future conversion of Israel influenced both medieval and post-Reformation exegesis. Aquinas’s synthesis of **typology** and supersessionism remains a foundational reference point for theological discussions on the relationship between the Church and Israel.
