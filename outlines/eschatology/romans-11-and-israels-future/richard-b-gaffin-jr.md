# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. interprets **Romans 11** within a robustly **Reformed redemptive-historical** framework, emphasizing the unity of **Jew and Gentile** in the **one people of God**. He affirms a future for **ethnic Israel** in God’s redemptive plan, but insists this future is realized only through union with **Christ** and incorporation into the **church**. Gaffin’s reading resists both supersessionism and any notion of a separate destiny for Israel apart from the gospel.

- "Paul’s concern in Romans 11 is not with a future for Israel apart from Christ, but with the continuing place of Israel in the one people of God as they come to faith in Christ." (Perspectives on Pentecost, p. 38)

## Key Works

- "The Fulfillment of the Law and Prophets: Christ and the Law in Pauline Theology" (in Kingdom, Covenants & Canon of the Old Testament)
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (in Resurrection and Redemption)
- "A Response to 'The Israel of God'" (in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)
- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (Westminster Theological Journal)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redemptive-Historical Unity of the People of God**
    - Emphasizes the continuity of **God’s covenant people** across the testaments.
    - Sees the church as the eschatological fulfillment of **Israel**.
    - Rejects any sharp division between Israel and the church in God’s plan.
    - Argues that all salvation is mediated through **union with Christ**.
    - "The church is not a parenthesis in God’s plan, but the fulfillment of his promise to Abraham." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Future Conversion of Ethnic Israel**
    - Affirms that **Romans 11** anticipates a future ingathering of ethnic Jews.
    - This conversion is corporate but not universal; it is a significant movement, not every individual Jew.
    - The future of Israel is realized only through faith in **Christ**.
    - Rejects any notion of a separate redemptive path for Israel.
    - "Paul expects a future turning of Israel to Christ, not apart from but within the church." (Theonomy and Eschatology)

3. **Opposition to Supersessionism**
    - Denies that the church replaces Israel in a way that nullifies God’s promises to the Jews.
    - Maintains that God’s covenant faithfulness to Israel is irrevocable, but fulfilled in Christ.
    - Argues that Gentile inclusion does not mean Jewish exclusion.
    - Sees the olive tree metaphor as expressing continuity and fulfillment, not replacement.
    - "The church does not supersede Israel but is the continuation and fulfillment of Israel in Christ." (A Response to 'The Israel of God')

4. **Eschatological Realization in Christ**
    - The promises to Israel are fulfilled in the **eschatological work of Christ**.
    - The resurrection inaugurates the new age, uniting Jew and Gentile.
    - The future hope for Israel is inseparable from the **already/not yet** tension of the New Testament.
    - All eschatological blessings are mediated through Christ’s resurrection and Spirit.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the turning point for Israel and the nations alike." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Hermeneutic of Apostolic Interpretation**
    - Prioritizes the **apostolic interpretation** of Old Testament prophecy.
    - Reads Romans 11 in light of the whole Pauline corpus and redemptive history.
    - Insists that the New Testament provides the normative lens for understanding Israel’s future.
    - Warns against speculative or literalistic readings of prophecy.
    - "Apostolic interpretation is determinative for how we understand the future of Israel." (The Fulfillment of the Law and Prophets)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s exegesis of **Romans 11** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the relationship between **Israel and the church**, especially in the context of covenant theology. His insistence on the unity of the people of God and the centrality of **union with Christ** has provided a robust alternative to both dispensationalism and supersessionism. Gaffin’s work continues to influence scholars and pastors committed to a redemptive-historical reading of Scripture, reinforcing the enduring significance of Paul’s teaching on Israel’s future within the one body of Christ.
