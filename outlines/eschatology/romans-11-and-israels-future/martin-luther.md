# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s interpretation of **Romans 11** is shaped by his emphasis on **justification by faith** and his understanding of the **relationship between Israel and the Church**. He saw the promises to Israel as fulfilled in Christ and extended to all believers, viewing the **Church as the new Israel** while still acknowledging a future for ethnic Jews in God’s providence. Luther’s approach is marked by a strong focus on the **sovereignty of God** in election and mercy.

- "Paul means that the Jews, although they have fallen, are not entirely cast away, but that a remnant is saved by grace." (Lectures on Romans)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Romans (1515–1516)
- Preface to the Epistle to the Romans (1522, 1546)
- Commentary on Romans (various editions)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 25: Lectures on Romans (ed. Wilhelm Pauck)
- The Bondage of the Will (for broader context on election and grace)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone**
   - Salvation is granted solely through **faith in Christ**, not by works or ethnic lineage.
   - The promises to Abraham are inherited by all who believe, Jew or Gentile.
   - **Romans 11** is read as affirming God’s mercy to all who trust in Christ.
   - The distinction between Jew and Gentile is overcome in the Gospel.
   - "For faith alone justifies, and not the works or merits of the law." (Preface to Romans)

2. **The Church as the New Israel**
   - The **Church** is the continuation and fulfillment of God’s people.
   - Believers, regardless of ethnicity, are grafted into the one people of God.
   - The “remnant” of Israel is those Jews who believe in Christ.
   - The olive tree metaphor in Romans 11 points to unity in Christ.
   - "The true Israel is not according to the flesh, but according to the promise." (Lectures on Romans)

3. **God’s Sovereignty in Election**
   - God’s choice is based on His mercy, not human merit or descent.
   - The hardening and restoration of Israel display God’s sovereign will.
   - Election is a mystery, but always serves to magnify divine grace.
   - The remnant is preserved by God’s gracious election.
   - "It is not of him who wills or runs, but of God who shows mercy." (Lectures on Romans)

4. **A Future for Ethnic Israel**
   - Luther acknowledges Paul’s hope for the eventual salvation of many Jews.
   - He interprets “all Israel will be saved” as a future ingathering of Jews to faith in Christ.
   - This future is not separate from the Church, but a restoration through faith.
   - God’s promises to Israel are irrevocable, fulfilled in Christ.
   - "God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew." (Lectures on Romans)

5. **Warning Against Presumption and Boasting**
   - Gentile believers are warned not to boast over the Jews.
   - Salvation is by grace, and all stand by faith alone.
   - The olive tree metaphor warns against arrogance and calls for humility.
   - Both Jews and Gentiles are dependent on God’s mercy.
   - "Do not be proud, but fear; for if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you." (Lectures on Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s reading of **Romans 11** shaped Protestant understandings of the **relationship between Israel and the Church**, emphasizing the unity of God’s people in Christ. His focus on **justification by faith** and the sovereignty of God in election influenced later Reformed and Lutheran traditions. While his views on the Jews were complex and sometimes problematic, his exegesis of Romans 11 remains foundational for discussions on Israel’s future within the context of salvation history.
