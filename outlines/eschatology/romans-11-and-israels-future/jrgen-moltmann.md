# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets **Romans 11** through his distinctive **theology of hope**, emphasizing the ongoing significance of **Israel** in God's redemptive plan. He insists that the **eschatological promises** to Israel are irrevocable and that Israel’s future is integrally connected to the universal reconciliation anticipated in Christ. Moltmann’s reading resists supersessionism, highlighting the enduring election of Israel within the unfolding of **salvation history**.
