# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **Romans 11** and the question of **Israel’s future** through his broader framework of **systematic theology**, emphasizing the symbolic and existential dimensions of biblical texts. He interpreted Israel’s role not as a matter of ethnic or national destiny, but as a symbol of the ongoing relationship between **divine revelation**, **estrangement**, and the **universal meaning of salvation** in Christ. For Tillich, the future of Israel is best understood within the context of the **New Being** and the unity of all humanity in the **Kingdom of God**.

- "The history of Israel is the history of the encounter with the divine, and its future is the future of all who are grasped by the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Israel as Symbolic of Universal Estrangement and Reconciliation**
    - Israel represents the existential condition of humanity’s **estrangement** from God.
    - The narrative of Israel is paradigmatic for understanding the human journey toward **reconciliation**.
    - Romans 11 is read as a symbol of the dialectic between rejection and acceptance.
    - The future of Israel is not ethnic restoration but universal participation in **salvation**.
    - "Israel is the symbol of the encounter and the estrangement, and of the reconciliation that is offered to all." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Revelation as Universal, Not Ethnic**
    - Divine revelation is not confined to a particular people but is universally accessible.
    - The election of Israel points to the universal offer of **grace** in Christ.
    - Romans 11’s “all Israel will be saved” is interpreted existentially, not nationally.
    - The church is the bearer of revelation, transcending ethnic boundaries.
    - "Revelation breaks through all particularities and becomes universal in the Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **The New Being in Christ as Fulfillment**
    - The **New Being** in Christ is the fulfillment of Israel’s hope and humanity’s destiny.
    - Romans 11 is seen as pointing to the transformation available in the New Being.
    - The future of Israel is realized in the participation of all in the New Being.
    - The distinction between Jew and Gentile is overcome in the unity of the New Creation.
    - "The New Being is the answer to the question posed by the history of Israel and the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Existential Interpretation of Biblical Texts**
    - Tillich reads Romans 11 through the lens of existential theology, focusing on meaning rather than prediction.
    - The text’s significance lies in its power to address the human condition of separation and hope.
    - Prophetic and apostolic writings are interpreted as symbols of existential realities.
    - The future is not a chronological event but an existential possibility for all.
    - "The biblical message is existential; it speaks to the situation of estrangement and the hope for reunion." (Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality)

5. **Kingdom of God as Ultimate Unity**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is the ultimate reality toward which all history moves.
    - Israel’s future is subsumed under the eschatological hope for universal reconciliation.
    - Romans 11’s vision is fulfilled in the unity of all in the Kingdom, not in national restoration.
    - The church is called to witness to this unity and reconciliation.
    - "The Kingdom of God is the symbol for the ultimate unity of all who are reconciled." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential and symbolic reading of **Romans 11** shifted the focus from ethnic or nationalistic interpretations of Israel’s future to a universal, Christocentric vision of **salvation**. His approach influenced later theological discussions on the relationship between **church and Israel**, emphasizing the unity of humanity in the **Kingdom of God**. While his views diverged from traditional Reformed and dispensational readings, Tillich’s work remains significant for those exploring the intersection of biblical interpretation, existential philosophy, and systematic theology.
