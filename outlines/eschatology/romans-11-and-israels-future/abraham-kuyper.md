# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached **Romans 11** and the question of **Israel’s future** through the lens of **covenant theology** and the unfolding of **redemptive history**. He affirmed the ongoing significance of the **Jewish people** in God’s plan, emphasizing both the continuity of the **covenant of grace** and the eschatological hope for Israel’s restoration, while maintaining the centrality of the **church** as the new covenant community.

- "The future of Israel is not a closed chapter, but a living hope rooted in the unbreakable promises of God." (Toekomst van het Joodsche Volk)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s nuanced approach to **Romans 11** and Israel’s future influenced later Reformed discussions on the relationship between the church and Israel. His emphasis on **covenant continuity** and the enduring significance of the Jewish people provided a corrective to supersessionist tendencies in Reformed theology. Kuyper’s legacy endures in contemporary debates about the place of Israel in **redemptive history**, shaping both theological scholarship and ecumenical dialogue.
