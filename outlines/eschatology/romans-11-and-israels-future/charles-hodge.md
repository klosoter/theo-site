# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge interpreted **Romans 11** as affirming a future, large-scale **conversion of ethnic Israel** within the unfolding of **redemptive history**. He maintained that the **promises to Israel** are not abrogated but will be fulfilled in a way consistent with the unity of the **church** and the **sovereignty of God** in salvation.

- "The apostle teaches that the restoration of the Jews is included in the predictions and promises of God." (Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans)

## Key Works

- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on Romans)
- The Way of Life

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Future Restoration of Israel**
    - Hodge taught that Romans 11 predicts a future, national turning of Israel to Christ.
    - He distinguished between the **remnant** chosen now and a future, widespread conversion.
    - This restoration is not merely spiritual but involves the ethnic descendants of Abraham.
    - The event will occur in the context of the **fullness of the Gentiles** entering the church.
    - "The conversion of the Jews is, therefore, a future event, clearly predicted by the apostle." (Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans)

2. **Unity of the Church**
    - Hodge rejected the idea of two separate peoples of God.
    - He saw believing Jews and Gentiles as united in the one **olive tree** of salvation.
    - The future conversion of Israel means their re-grafting into the existing church.
    - The church is the continuation and fulfillment of Old Testament Israel.
    - "There is but one olive tree, one church, one plan of salvation." (Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans)

3. **Covenantal Fulfillment**
    - Hodge argued that God's promises to Israel are irrevocable and will be fulfilled.
    - The **Abrahamic covenant** undergirds the hope for Israel’s future.
    - Fulfillment is not by mere ethnicity, but by faith in Christ.
    - The faithfulness of God to his covenant is central to Paul’s argument in Romans 11.
    - "God’s covenant with Abraham and his seed cannot fail of accomplishment." (Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans)

4. **Divine Sovereignty in Salvation**
    - Hodge emphasized that both Jewish and Gentile salvation are acts of divine mercy.
    - The **hardening** and subsequent mercy shown to Israel display God’s sovereign purposes.
    - Human boasting is excluded; all are dependent on grace.
    - The future restoration is part of God’s mysterious and wise plan.
    - "For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all." (Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans)

5. **Eschatological Hope**
    - Hodge linked the conversion of Israel to broader eschatological blessings for the world.
    - He saw this event as ushering in greater gospel prosperity.
    - The restoration of Israel is a sign of the advancing **kingdom of God**.
    - This hope motivates prayer and missionary effort for Jewish evangelism.
    - "The restoration of the Jews will be as life from the dead to the world." (Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s interpretation of **Romans 11** has shaped much of the **Reformed tradition’s** expectation regarding Israel’s future. His insistence on the unity of the church and the faithfulness of God to his covenant promises remains influential in discussions of **biblical eschatology**. Hodge’s careful exegesis and theological synthesis continue to inform evangelical and Presbyterian readings of Paul’s teaching about Israel. His work provides a model for integrating **systematic theology** and biblical commentary on complex doctrinal issues.
