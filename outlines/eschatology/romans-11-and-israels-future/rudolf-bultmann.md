# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **Romans 11** and the question of **Israel’s future** through the lens of his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He argued that Paul’s discussion of Israel is not about a literal, future restoration of the nation, but rather about the ongoing possibility of **salvation** for both Jews and Gentiles within the **kerygma** of the gospel. For Bultmann, the focus is on the existential response to the **Word of God**, not on historical or ethnic destinies.

- "Paul does not speak of a future conversion of Israel as a nation, but of the possibility that individual Jews may come to faith." (Romans, in Exegetica, 1967)

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (especially Vol. 1, on Paul)
- "Romans" (commentary, 1934)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (essay in Kerygma and Myth, 1941)
- "Exegesis Without Presuppositions?" (1948)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Eschatology**
    - Interprets biblical eschatology existentially, not as prediction of historical events.
    - Sees Paul's statements about Israel as symbolic of the universal offer of salvation.
    - Rejects a literal national future for Israel in Romans 11.
    - Emphasizes the present encounter with Christ over future fulfillment.
    - "The eschatological event is not a future occurrence but the present proclamation of the Word." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Universal Scope of Salvation**
    - Argues that Paul’s concern is the inclusion of all, not ethnic Israel per se.
    - Views the "remnant" motif as typological for all who respond in faith.
    - Salvation is available to Jews and Gentiles alike through faith in Christ.
    - The distinction between Jew and Gentile is overcome in the gospel.
    - "There is no special privilege for Israel; all stand before God in the same way." (Romans, commentary)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Scripture**
    - Scripture addresses the individual’s existential situation, not collective destinies.
    - Romans 11 is read as a call to faith, not a prophecy of national restoration.
    - The "hardening" of Israel is a paradigm for human resistance to grace.
    - The focus is on personal decision in response to the kerygma.
    - "The question is not about Israel’s fate, but about the decision of faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Critique of Salvation History (Heilsgeschichte)**
    - Rejects Heilsgeschichte as a framework for Paul’s theology.
    - Sees salvation history as mythological and existentially irrelevant.
    - Romans 11 is not a stage in a divine plan for nations.
    - The only history that matters is the history of the individual’s encounter with Christ.
    - "Paul’s interest is not in a historical process but in the existential now." (History and Eschatology)

5. **Priority of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is central, not ethnic or historical fulfillment.
    - Israel’s "fullness" is realized in the preaching of the gospel to all.
    - The church is defined by response to the kerygma, not by descent.
    - Romans 11 serves to reinforce the universality of the gospel message.
    - "The kerygma abolishes all distinctions and creates the new people of God." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential and **demythologizing** approach to Romans 11 has profoundly shaped modern critical scholarship, especially in its skepticism toward literal or nationalistic readings of Israel’s future. His emphasis on the **universal scope of salvation** and the present encounter with the Word challenged both traditional Reformed and dispensational interpretations. While later scholars have critiqued his dismissal of salvation history, Bultmann’s influence endures in debates over the theological significance of Israel in Paul’s thought. His work remains a touchstone for existential and post-liberal readings of Pauline eschatology.
