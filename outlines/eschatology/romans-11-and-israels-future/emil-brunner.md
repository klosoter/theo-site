# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **Romans 11** and the question of **Israel’s future** from within his broader **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the ongoing significance of Israel in the unfolding of **salvation history**. He rejected both supersessionism and dispensationalism, instead arguing that the **Church** and **Israel** are distinct yet related within God’s redemptive plan, with Israel retaining a unique role in the eschatological fulfillment of God’s promises.

- "The Church is not the replacement of Israel, but the sign of the coming fulfillment of God’s promise to His people." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Divine Imperative

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Israel’s Ongoing Election**
    - Brunner affirms that God’s election of Israel is not revoked by the coming of Christ.
    - He interprets Romans 11 as teaching a continuing divine purpose for ethnic Israel.
    - The Church does not replace Israel but participates in the promises through Christ.
    - Israel’s role in salvation history remains significant until the eschaton.
    - "God’s faithfulness to Israel is the guarantee of His faithfulness to all." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

2. **Unity of Salvation History**
    - Brunner sees a single, unfolding plan of redemption encompassing both Israel and the Church.
    - He rejects any sharp division between Old and New Testament people of God.
    - The promises to Israel are fulfilled in Christ but not exhausted by the Church.
    - Romans 11 is read as a testimony to the unity and continuity of God’s redemptive work.
    - "The history of salvation is one, and Israel’s story is not yet finished." (The Mediator)

3. **Rejection of Supersessionism**
    - Brunner opposes the idea that the Church has fully replaced Israel in God’s purposes.
    - He maintains that Paul’s argument in Romans 11 upholds Israel’s future hope.
    - The Church is a sign and instrument, not the total fulfillment, of God’s promises to Israel.
    - Israel’s partial hardening is temporary and will be overcome in God’s timing.
    - "The Church is not the end of Israel, but the anticipation of its fulfillment." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

4. **Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Brunner interprets Romans 11 as pointing toward a future ingathering of Israel.
    - He emphasizes the mystery of God’s plan, culminating in the salvation of “all Israel.”
    - The eschatological hope includes both Jews and Gentiles in the consummation.
    - This fulfillment is grounded in God’s mercy and faithfulness, not human merit.
    - "The final word is not judgment, but mercy for all." (The Divine Imperative)

5. **Christological Center**
    - Brunner insists that Christ is the center and fulfillment of all God’s promises.
    - Israel’s future is inseparable from faith in Christ as Messiah.
    - The Church’s mission is to witness to Christ among both Jews and Gentiles.
    - Romans 11 is ultimately about the triumph of God’s grace in Christ.
    - "In Christ, the promises to Israel find their Yes and Amen, but their story continues." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s reading of **Romans 11** influenced postwar Protestant theology by challenging supersessionist tendencies and affirming the enduring significance of Israel in **salvation history**. His dialectical approach provided a mediating position between Reformed and dispensational interpretations, emphasizing both the unity and distinction of Israel and the Church. Brunner’s work contributed to renewed theological engagement with the Jewish people and remains a reference point in discussions of **eschatology** and the future of Israel.
