# Craig A. Blaising (1954– )

Craig A. Blaising is a leading proponent of **progressive dispensationalism** and has written extensively on **Romans 11** and the question of **Israel’s future** in the plan of God. He argues that Paul envisions a future **national restoration of Israel** that is organically connected to the **eschatological fulfillment** of God’s promises, while maintaining the unity of **Jew and Gentile** in the **one people of God**.

- "Paul affirms a future for ethnic Israel that is rooted in the irrevocable promises of God, yet integrally related to the salvation of the Gentiles." (Three Views on Israel and the Church)

## Key Works

- "Three Views on Israel and the Church: Perspectives on Romans 9–11" (with Walter C. Kaiser Jr. and Darrell L. Bock)
- "Progressive Dispensationalism" (with Darrell L. Bock)
- "The Future of Israel as a Theological Question" (in The People, the Land, and the Future of Israel)
- "Israel and Hermeneutics" (in Dispensationalism, Israel and the Church)
- "The Fulfillment of the Biblical Covenants" (in Progressive Dispensationalism)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Future National Restoration of Israel**
   - Romans 11 teaches a future, large-scale turning of ethnic Israel to Christ.
   - This restoration is grounded in the **Abrahamic** and **New Covenants**.
   - The "fullness" and "acceptance" of Israel are eschatological realities.
   - Israel’s future is not superseded but fulfilled within God’s redemptive plan.
   - "Paul’s argument in Romans 11 points to a future restoration of Israel as a nation, in fulfillment of God’s covenant promises." (Three Views on Israel and the Church)

2. **Unity of Jew and Gentile in Christ**
   - The **olive tree** metaphor in Romans 11 affirms one people of God.
   - Gentiles are grafted in, but Israel’s identity is not erased.
   - The unity is spiritual, but ethnic distinctions are not obliterated.
   - Both groups share in the blessings of the covenants through Christ.
   - "The unity of Jew and Gentile does not negate the future role of Israel, but rather anticipates its fulfillment in Christ." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

3. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
   - The present age sees partial fulfillment of God’s promises to Israel.
   - The "hardening" of Israel is temporary and will be lifted.
   - The "remnant" now anticipates a future, corporate turning.
   - The fullness of eschatological blessing awaits Christ’s return.
   - "Romans 11 presents an already/not yet tension regarding Israel’s salvation and restoration." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

4. **Hermeneutical Priority of Biblical Covenants**
   - The **Abrahamic**, **Davidic**, and **New Covenants** guide interpretation.
   - Romans 11 must be read in light of Old Testament prophetic expectation.
   - The promises to Israel are not spiritualized away or transferred.
   - The church participates in, but does not exhaust, the covenant blessings.
   - "The covenants provide the theological framework for understanding Paul’s argument about Israel’s future." (The Fulfillment of the Biblical Covenants)

5. **Irrevocability of God’s Promises**
   - God’s gifts and calling to Israel are "irrevocable" (Rom 11:29).
   - Divine faithfulness ensures the ultimate fulfillment of the promises.
   - The future of Israel is a testimony to God’s mercy and sovereignty.
   - The church’s existence does not nullify God’s word to Israel.
   - "God’s faithfulness to Israel is the guarantee of His faithfulness to all His people." (Three Views on Israel and the Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Craig A. Blaising has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical discussions on **Romans 11** and the future of Israel, especially through his articulation of **progressive dispensationalism**. His work has encouraged a more nuanced reading of Pauline texts, emphasizing both the continuity and distinction between Israel and the church. Blaising’s scholarship has fostered renewed interest in the **biblical covenants** and their eschatological fulfillment, influencing both academic and pastoral approaches to the doctrine of Israel’s future.
