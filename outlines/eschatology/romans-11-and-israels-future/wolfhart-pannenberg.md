# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **Romans 11** and **Israel’s future** within his broader vision of **universal eschatology** and the unfolding of **God’s historical revelation**. He emphasized the ongoing significance of **Israel** in salvation history, interpreting Paul’s argument as pointing toward a future fulfillment of God’s promises to Israel within the consummation of all things in Christ. For Pannenberg, the fate of Israel is inseparable from the **eschatological hope** for the reconciliation of all humanity.

- "The salvation of Israel is a sign of the faithfulness of God to his promises and the universality of his saving will." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Faithfulness to Israel**
   - God’s promises to Israel remain valid and are not nullified by the coming of Christ.
   - Romans 11 is read as affirming the irrevocability of God’s covenant with Israel.
   - The continued existence of Israel is a testimony to God’s ongoing purpose in history.
   - The church must recognize its dependence on the root of Israel.
   - "God’s faithfulness is at stake in the fulfillment of his promises to Israel." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Universal Eschatological Fulfillment**
   - The future of Israel is bound up with the eschatological consummation of all things.
   - Romans 11 points to a final ingathering that includes both Jews and Gentiles.
   - Eschatology is not merely individual but cosmic and historical.
   - The salvation of Israel is a sign of the universal scope of redemption.
   - "The eschatological hope includes the restoration of Israel as part of the reconciliation of the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Unity of Salvation History**
   - God’s revelation unfolds progressively through Israel and culminates in Christ.
   - Romans 11 demonstrates the continuity between Old and New Covenants.
   - The church is grafted into the story of Israel, not a replacement.
   - The history of Israel remains essential for understanding God’s purposes.
   - "The history of Israel is not superseded but fulfilled in the history of Jesus." (Jesus—God and Man)

4. **The Church’s Relationship to Israel**
   - The church is called to humility, recognizing its grafted status.
   - Supersessionism is rejected in favor of a theology of inclusion and fulfillment.
   - The church’s mission is shaped by the ongoing role of Israel in God’s plan.
   - Romans 11 warns against arrogance toward the Jewish people.
   - "The church stands in solidarity with Israel, awaiting the fulfillment of God’s promises." (Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Revelation as Historical Event**
   - God’s self-disclosure occurs within the unfolding of historical events.
   - Israel’s story is a key locus of revelation, culminating but not ending in Christ.
   - Romans 11 is interpreted through the lens of God’s ongoing action in history.
   - The future of Israel is part of the open-endedness of God’s historical revelation.
   - "Revelation is not a closed past but an open future in which Israel still has a part." (Revelation as History)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s reading of **Romans 11** has shaped contemporary discussions on the relationship between **Israel and the Church**, especially in the context of **universal eschatology**. His insistence on the enduring significance of Israel challenged supersessionist tendencies and encouraged a more inclusive understanding of salvation history. Pannenberg’s work continues to influence ecumenical dialogue and theological reflection on the future of Israel within the broader scope of God’s redemptive plan.
