# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine approached **Romans 11** within his broader theology of the **Church**, **predestination**, and the relationship between **Israel and the Gentiles**. He interpreted Paul’s teaching as affirming the unity of **God’s elect** across history, seeing the **future of Israel** as fulfilled in the incorporation of believing Jews into the one **body of Christ**, rather than a distinct national restoration.

- "For all the Jews who are to believe, as well as all the Gentiles who are to believe, are called the fullness of the Gentiles and all Israel." (Enarrationes in Psalmos 59.2)

## Key Works

- Enarrationes in Psalmos (Expositions on the Psalms)
- Epistulae (Letters), especially Letter 149 to Paulinus
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- Tractatus in Iohannis Evangelium (Tractates on the Gospel of John)
- Augustine through the Ages: An Encyclopedia (ed. Allan D. Fitzgerald, for secondary reference)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Elect in Christ**
    - Augustine saw **Romans 11** as teaching that both Jews and Gentiles are united in one **people of God**.
    - He denied a future, separate restoration of ethnic Israel apart from Christ.
    - The "all Israel" who will be saved refers to the totality of the **elect**, not to the nation as such.
    - The Church is the true continuation of Israel, embracing all who believe.
    - "For both peoples are one, the circumcised and the uncircumcised, all who believe in Him." (Enarrationes in Psalmos 59.2)

2. **Predestination and Divine Sovereignty**
    - Augustine emphasized that salvation is entirely by **God’s sovereign grace**.
    - The hardening and restoration described in Romans 11 are subject to God’s eternal decree.
    - The remnant of Israel is chosen by grace, not by works or ethnicity.
    - The inclusion of Gentiles is a demonstration of God’s mercy and plan.
    - "For not all the descendants of Israel are Israel, but only those who are chosen by grace." (De Civitate Dei 18.28)

3. **Typological Fulfillment in the Church**
    - Augustine interpreted Old Testament promises to Israel as fulfilled **spiritually** in the Church.
    - The Church is the new Israel, inheriting the promises made to the patriarchs.
    - The olive tree metaphor in Romans 11 signifies the continuity of God’s people through faith.
    - The restoration of Israel is realized as Jews come to faith in Christ and join the Church.
    - "The promises were made to Abraham and his seed, which is Christ and those who are in Him." (Tractatus in Iohannis Evangelium 45.9)

4. **Warning Against Boasting and Presumption**
    - Augustine warned Gentile Christians not to boast over the Jews, echoing Paul’s admonition.
    - He taught that both groups stand only by faith and grace, not by merit.
    - The cutting off and grafting in are warnings to persevere in humility.
    - The Church must pray for the conversion of all, including Jews.
    - "Do not be high-minded, but fear; for if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you." (Enarrationes in Psalmos 59.2)

5. **Hope for Jewish Conversion**
    - Augustine maintained hope for the ongoing conversion of Jews to Christ.
    - He saw the "fullness" of Israel as being reached when the elect Jews believe.
    - This hope is not for a national or political restoration, but for spiritual inclusion in Christ.
    - The Church’s mission includes evangelizing Jews as part of God’s redemptive plan.
    - "Many from Israel are yet to believe, and thus all Israel will be saved." (Epistula 149)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s interpretation of **Romans 11** profoundly shaped the Western Church’s understanding of the relationship between **Israel and the Church**. His emphasis on the unity of the **elect** and the spiritual fulfillment of Old Testament promises in Christ became foundational for later **Reformed** and **Catholic** theology. While later interpreters have debated the details, Augustine’s approach remains a key reference point in discussions of **supersessionism** and the future of Israel.
