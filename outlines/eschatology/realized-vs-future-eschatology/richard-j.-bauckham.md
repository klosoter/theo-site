# Richard Bauckham (1946–)

Richard Bauckham is a leading New Testament scholar whose work on **eschatology** emphasizes the integration of both **realized** and **future eschatology** within the biblical witness, particularly in the **Book of Revelation** and the **Johannine literature**. He argues that the New Testament presents a dynamic tension between the **already** and the **not yet**, affirming the present reality of salvation while maintaining the expectation of a future consummation.

- "The New Testament does not simply juxtapose present and future eschatology, but relates them in a dynamic and complex way." (The Theology of the Book of Revelation)

## Key Works

- The Theology of the Book of Revelation (1993)
- Jesus and the Eyewitnesses (2006)
- Gospel of Glory: Major Themes in Johannine Theology (2015)
- The Climax of Prophecy: Studies on the Book of Revelation (1993)
- The Bible and Ecology: Rediscovering the Community of Creation (2010)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Integration of Realized and Future Eschatology**
    - Bauckham contends that **Revelation** and **John’s Gospel** hold together both present and future aspects of eschatology.
    - He rejects any reduction of New Testament eschatology to merely realized or merely futuristic terms.
    - The **kingdom of God** is both inaugurated in Christ and awaits final fulfillment.
    - The church lives in the tension of **already** and **not yet** realities.
    - "John’s eschatology is both realized and future, and the two aspects are inseparable." (Gospel of Glory)

2. **Christological Center of Eschatology**
    - The person and work of **Jesus Christ** are central to understanding eschatological fulfillment.
    - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the new age, but its full effects are still to come.
    - The **Lamb** in Revelation is both the present ruler and the one who will come.
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in the completed and ongoing work of Christ.
    - "The Lamb who was slain is the one who will come in final victory." (The Theology of the Book of Revelation)

3. **Eschatology and the People of God**
    - The identity and mission of the church are shaped by living between the times.
    - The church participates in the **reign of Christ** now, anticipating its consummation.
    - Witness and suffering are marks of the church’s eschatological existence.
    - The church’s worship anticipates the final redemption of all creation.
    - "The people of God are called to faithful witness in the present, awaiting the new creation." (The Climax of Prophecy)

4. **Cosmic Scope of Eschatology**
    - Bauckham emphasizes the **renewal of creation** as a key aspect of biblical eschatology.
    - Eschatology is not limited to individual salvation but encompasses all of creation.
    - The final vision in Revelation is the **new heaven and new earth**.
    - Ecological concerns are integrated into eschatological hope.
    - "The new creation is the goal of God’s redemptive purpose for the whole cosmos." (The Bible and Ecology)

5. **Prophetic and Apocalyptic Imagination**
    - Revelation’s apocalyptic imagery conveys both present realities and future hope.
    - Prophetic literature shapes Christian imagination for living in the overlap of the ages.
    - Symbolism in apocalyptic texts communicates the certainty of God’s ultimate victory.
    - The prophetic call is to faithful endurance amid present tribulation.
    - "Apocalyptic language enables believers to perceive present realities in the light of God’s future." (Theology of the Book of Revelation)

## Legacy and Impact

Bauckham’s scholarship has significantly shaped contemporary understanding of **New Testament eschatology**, especially the interplay between realized and future dimensions. His work has influenced both academic and ecclesial discussions on the **kingdom of God**, the mission of the church, and the cosmic scope of redemption. By holding together the **already/not yet** tension, Bauckham has provided a robust framework for interpreting eschatological texts and their relevance for Christian life and hope.
