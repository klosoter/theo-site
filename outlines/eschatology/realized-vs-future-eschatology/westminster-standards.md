# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards present a balanced view of **eschatology** that affirms both the **already** and the **not yet** aspects of **redemptive history**. While the **kingdom of Christ** is inaugurated in the present age through his first coming, the Standards maintain a strong emphasis on the **future consummation** at his return, holding together **realized eschatology** and the expectation of the **final judgment**, **resurrection**, and **new creation**.

- "At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed: and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other, although with different qualities, which shall be united again to their souls forever." (Westminster Confession of Faith 32.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 8, 25, 32, 33)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 56–90)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 37–38)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on the Lord’s Supper and prayer)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Already/Not Yet Structure**
    - The kingdom of Christ is present in the church but awaits final consummation.
    - Believers experience spiritual benefits now, such as **justification** and **sanctification**.
    - The **age to come** is inaugurated but not fully realized.
    - The Standards distinguish between present spiritual realities and future physical fulfillment.
    - "The visible Church...is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, the house and family of God, out of which there is no ordinary possibility of salvation." (WCF 25.2)

2. **Future Bodily Resurrection**
    - The resurrection is a future, physical event for all humanity.
    - The same bodies that die will be raised and glorified or dishonored.
    - The resurrection is linked to Christ’s return and the final judgment.
    - This hope shapes Christian life and perseverance.
    - "All the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other, although with different qualities." (WCF 32.2)

3. **Final Judgment and Consummation**
    - Christ will return to judge the living and the dead.
    - The righteous will enter everlasting life; the wicked, everlasting punishment.
    - The final judgment is a future event, not yet realized.
    - The Standards emphasize the certainty and universality of this judgment.
    - "God hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world, in righteousness, by Jesus Christ." (WCF 33.1)

4. **Present Spiritual Benefits**
    - Believers currently possess benefits such as **adoption**, **sanctification**, and **assurance**.
    - The Holy Spirit applies redemption now, uniting believers to Christ.
    - The church enjoys a foretaste of the age to come through the means of grace.
    - These benefits are grounded in Christ’s finished work but anticipate future fulfillment.
    - "They, who are effectually called and regenerated...are further sanctified, really and personally, through the virtue of Christ’s death and resurrection." (WCF 13.1)

5. **Hope of New Creation**
    - The ultimate hope is the renewal of all things in the new heavens and new earth.
    - The present world is passing away, but God will make all things new.
    - The Standards affirm the restoration of creation as the final goal of redemption.
    - This hope motivates holy living and perseverance.
    - "The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonour; the bodies of the just, by his Spirit, unto honour, and be made conformable to his own glorious body." (WLC 87)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed eschatology**, providing a framework that holds together the tension between **realized** and **future** aspects of redemption. Their careful articulation of the **already/not yet** dynamic has influenced generations of theologians and confessional documents. The Standards’ balanced approach continues to inform the doctrine, worship, and hope of Reformed churches worldwide.
