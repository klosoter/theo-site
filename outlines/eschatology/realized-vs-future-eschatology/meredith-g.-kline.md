# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline developed a distinctive approach to **eschatology** by emphasizing both the **already** and **not yet** aspects of the **kingdom of God**. He argued that the **inauguration** of the kingdom in Christ’s first coming anticipates its **consummation** at the end of history, integrating **covenant theology** and **biblical typology** to explain the relationship between realized and future eschatology.

- "The kingdom of God is present in mystery, but its consummation awaits the coming in glory." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Images of the Spirit
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos
- By Oath Consigned
- Structure of Biblical Authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Already/Not Yet Structure of Eschatology**
    - The kingdom is inaugurated in Christ’s first coming but awaits final fulfillment.
    - Old Testament types and shadows point to present realities and future consummation.
    - The church lives in the tension between realized blessings and future hope.
    - Eschatological fulfillment is both present in Christ and future in glory.
    - "The eschatological kingdom is already present in the midst of history, though its fullness is yet to come." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenant as Eschatological Framework**
    - Covenants structure redemptive history toward eschatological goals.
    - The **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** both have eschatological dimensions.
    - The Sabbath is a sign of the ultimate rest to come.
    - The new creation is anticipated in covenantal promises and rituals.
    - "Covenant history is the history of the coming of the kingdom of God." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Typology and Intrusion Ethics**
    - Old Testament events serve as types of eschatological realities.
    - The intrusion of final judgment and blessing occurs in redemptive history.
    - Typological fulfillment bridges realized and future eschatology.
    - The conquest and judgment motifs prefigure ultimate eschatological events.
    - "Intrusion ethics is the principle by which the final judgment is anticipated in history." (Images of the Spirit)

4. **Heavenly Pattern and Earthly Reality**
    - Earthly sanctuaries and rituals reflect heavenly, eschatological realities.
    - The tabernacle and temple are copies of the heavenly archetype.
    - The church participates in the heavenly assembly now, awaiting full realization.
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in the heavenly order revealed in Christ.
    - "The pattern shown on the mountain is the heavenly reality toward which history moves." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Christ as Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Jesus is the second Adam who secures the eschatological inheritance.
    - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the new creation.
    - The Spirit’s outpouring is a foretaste of future glory.
    - Believers are united to Christ in both present realization and future consummation.
    - "In Christ, the age to come has broken into the present age." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s integration of **biblical theology** and **covenant eschatology** has profoundly shaped Reformed understanding of the relationship between realized and future eschatology. His emphasis on typology and the already/not yet dynamic has influenced generations of scholars and pastors, particularly within the Westminster tradition. Kline’s work continues to inform discussions on the structure of redemptive history and the nature of the kingdom of God.
