# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed eschatology** that affirms both the **already** and **not yet** dimensions of the Christian hope. These confessions stress the present reality of **union with Christ** and participation in **eternal life**, while also emphasizing the future consummation at **Christ’s return**, the **resurrection of the dead**, and the **final judgment**.

- "We believe, according to the Word of God, that when the time appointed by the Lord (which is unknown to all creatures) is come and the number of the elect is complete, our Lord Jesus Christ will come from heaven, bodily and visibly, as He ascended, with great glory and majesty, to declare Himself Judge of the living and the dead." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Already/Not Yet Structure of Eschatology**
    - Affirms that believers possess **eternal life** now through **union with Christ**.
    - Teaches that the **kingdom of God** is present but awaits future consummation.
    - Emphasizes the ongoing tension between present spiritual realities and future fulfillment.
    - Grounds assurance in Christ’s finished work while directing hope to His return.
    "Since Christ is our Head, we cannot be separated from Him. Consequently, after this life we shall be resurrected, and we shall possess a new, glorified body." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 57–58)

2. **Future Bodily Resurrection and Judgment**
    - Confesses a literal, future **resurrection of the dead** for both the righteous and the wicked.
    - Asserts that Christ will return bodily to judge all humanity.
    - Connects the believer’s present spiritual life to the hope of future bodily renewal.
    - Rejects any notion that resurrection is merely spiritual or realized in the present age.
    "All men will appear personally before this great Judge... to give an account of every idle word they have spoken." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

3. **Present Participation in Christ’s Benefits**
    - Teaches that believers already share in Christ’s victory over death.
    - Emphasizes the present enjoyment of **forgiveness of sins** and **eternal life**.
    - Links the sacraments (especially baptism and the Lord’s Supper) to present eschatological realities.
    - Encourages assurance based on present possession of salvation, not just future hope.
    "Even as I already now experience in my heart the beginning of eternal joy." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 58)

4. **Hope Fixed on Christ’s Return**
    - Directs the church’s hope toward the visible, glorious return of Christ.
    - Frames Christian perseverance and comfort in light of the coming consummation.
    - Warns against over-realized eschatology that denies the future aspect of redemption.
    - Calls believers to live in expectation and readiness for the end.
    "We look for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 52)

5. **Assurance and Comfort in Eschatological Tension**
    - Provides assurance through Christ’s present reign and intercession.
    - Grounds comfort in both the present reality of salvation and the certainty of future glory.
    - Encourages believers to endure suffering with eyes fixed on the promised consummation.
    - Balances present spiritual blessings with the longing for final deliverance.
    "In all my sorrow and persecution, I lift up my head and eagerly await... the Judge from heaven." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 52)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have decisively shaped **Reformed eschatology**, providing a balanced articulation of realized and future dimensions of redemption. Their confessional witness guards against both under-realized and over-realized eschatologies, rooting the church’s hope in Christ’s finished work and promised return. These documents continue to inform Reformed preaching, catechesis, and pastoral care, ensuring that the tension between the "already" and "not yet" remains central to the church’s faith and practice.
