# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **eschatology** through his distinctive **tri-perspectivalism**, emphasizing the interplay between the **already** and the **not yet** in the unfolding of **redemptive history**. He affirms that the **kingdom of God** is both inaugurated in Christ’s first coming and awaits consummation at his return, integrating **realized eschatology** with a robust expectation of future fulfillment.

- "The kingdom is present in one sense, but in another sense it is still to come." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Tri-Perspectival Approach to Eschatology**
    - Frames eschatology through the **normative**, **situational**, and **existential** perspectives.
    - Sees the tension between **realized** and **future eschatology** as complementary, not contradictory.
    - Emphasizes that biblical truth is best understood through multiple, interrelated angles.
    - Applies this method to clarify the presence and future aspects of the **kingdom**.
    - "We must see the kingdom as both present and future, as both realized and yet to be realized." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Already/Not Yet Structure of the Kingdom**
    - Affirms that Christ’s first coming inaugurated the **kingdom of God**.
    - Maintains that the full realization of the kingdom awaits Christ’s return.
    - Argues that believers live in the tension of **present blessings** and **future hope**.
    - Connects this structure to the broader narrative of **redemptive history**.
    - "The New Testament teaches both the present reality and the future consummation of the kingdom." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Integration of Realized and Future Eschatology**
    - Rejects any dichotomy between realized and future eschatology.
    - Insists that both aspects are essential to a biblical understanding of **eschatological hope**.
    - Highlights the continuity between the work of Christ now and his future return.
    - Uses this integration to inform Christian ethics and mission.
    - "The tension between the already and the not yet is not a contradiction, but a feature of biblical revelation." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

4. **Eschatology and Covenant Lordship**
    - Grounds eschatological expectation in God’s **covenant lordship**.
    - Stresses that God’s promises are both fulfilled and awaiting fulfillment in Christ.
    - Links the authority of Christ as Lord to the certainty of future consummation.
    - Views the believer’s present experience as shaped by Christ’s ongoing reign.
    - "God’s lordship guarantees both the present reality and the future certainty of his promises." (The Doctrine of God)

5. **Practical Implications for Christian Living**
    - Encourages believers to live in light of both present realities and future promises.
    - Applies eschatological truths to worship, ethics, and mission.
    - Warns against overemphasizing either the present or future to the neglect of the other.
    - Calls for hope, perseverance, and engagement in the world.
    - "Our lives must reflect both the blessings we have now and the hope we await." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s integration of **realized** and **future eschatology** has influenced contemporary Reformed thought, especially through his tri-perspectival method. His work has encouraged theologians and pastors to hold together the present and future dimensions of the **kingdom of God** without reductionism. Frame’s emphasis on practical application has shaped how eschatology is taught and lived in the church, reinforcing the importance of both present assurance and future hope.
