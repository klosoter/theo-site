### TITLE
Holding the Tension: The Already and the Not Yet in New Testament Eschatology

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How to articulate the relation between the **already** inaugurated reign of God in Christ and the **not yet** consummated kingdom, without collapsing one into the other or fragmenting redemptive history.
- Decisive figures: C. H. Dodd, Oscar Cullmann, Geerhardus Vos, Herman Ridderbos, N. T. Wright.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed biblical theology and **federal theology**, twentieth‑century New Testament scholarship, classic Christian eschatology grounded in **creedal orthodoxy**.
- Debates:
  - Internal: degrees and structure of **realized eschatology** within Reformed and evangelical circles, ordo salutis vs historia salutis, kingdom and church, sacramental presence.
  - External: liberal and existential readings that over‑realize eschatology, dispensational futurism that over‑defers it, inaugurated vs purely futurist models of the kingdom.
  - Contemporary: prosperity theology, over‑realized charismatic spirituality, political theology and the kingdom, inaugurated eschatology and ethics, gender and creation, already/not yet and suffering.
- Defended position: A classic Reformed, inaugurated eschatology in which Christ’s first advent has truly introduced the **eschatological age** into history, yet the decisive and visible **consummation** of the kingdom, resurrection, and new creation awaits the parousia, so that all doctrine and practice must be framed by this structured already/not yet tension.

### ESSAY
Realized versus future eschatology names a fundamental tension in biblical theology: the New Testament simultaneously proclaims that the **eschatological age** has already dawned in the death and resurrection of Christ and that decisive eschatological events such as the resurrection of the dead, final judgment, and cosmic renewal remain future. To frame this rigorously for defense, one must avoid both an abstract survey and a simplistic slogan about the already and the not yet. The issue is how God’s **kingdom**, life of the **age to come**, and **new creation** are related in their inaugurated and consummated phases, and how that structure reconfigures anthropology, soteriology, ecclesiology, and ethics.

C. H. Dodd is a decisive starting point because he popularized the category of **realized eschatology** in modern New Testament studies and thus set the terms of much subsequent debate. Writing in the early to mid twentieth century, Dodd was reacting both to older liberal moralizing that reduced the kingdom to ethical ideals and to Albert Schweitzer’s thoroughgoing futurism which claimed that Jesus proclaimed an imminent apocalyptic end that failed to arrive. In works like “The Parables of the Kingdom” and “The Coming of Christ,” Dodd argued that in the preaching of Jesus the kingdom of God is fundamentally a present reality. For Dodd, the decisive act of God is not a still awaited apocalypse but the ministry of Jesus itself as the occurrence of divine judgment and salvation within history. His method was primarily historical‑critical and form‑critical, emphasizing the present tense of kingdom sayings, the realized force of judgment language, and the experience of eternal life now in Johannine theology. The conceptual contribution of Dodd was to insist that eschatology is not solely about a temporal end but about God’s qualitative invasion of history in Christ. However, his strongest claim was that later Christian expectation of a future coming and judgment represents a kind of re‑apocalypticizing of an essentially realized message.

This is precisely where the internal and external debates sharpen. Internally, among those who accept some form of realized eschatology, the question is how strongly it is realized. Externally, futurist critics argue that Dodd has truncated the robust future note that is pervasive in Jesus, Paul, and Revelation. Under examination, one must be able to affirm what Dodd rightly saw and reject his excess. The New Testament undeniably ascribes present reality to classically eschatological blessings: believers now have **eternal life**, have been raised with Christ, are seated with him in the heavenly places, and participate in the powers of the age to come. Yet the same texts speak of eternal life, resurrection, and judgment as future. Thus Dodd’s mature position collapses the future into the present in ways that cannot do justice to this tension.

Oscar Cullmann, another key twentieth‑century figure, offers a more balanced but still programmatic account of inaugurated eschatology that has significantly shaped Reformed biblical theology. Writing against both Dodd’s over‑realization and Schweitzer’s over‑futurism, Cullmann famously used the analogy of D‑Day and V‑Day in World War Two, especially in “Christ and Time” and “Salvation in History.” The decisive battle has been won in Christ’s death and resurrection, but the war is not yet over. Methodologically, Cullmann is a salvation‑historian. He insists that eschatology cannot be detached from the linear **history of redemption** that runs from creation through election, exodus, monarchy, exile, and finally to Christ and the church. For Cullmann, the New Testament lives in the tension between the “already” of Christ’s victory over sin, death, and Satan and the “not yet” of the final subjugation of all enemies, the parousia, and the resurrection of the dead.

Cullmann’s contribution is twofold. First, he shows that eschatology is not merely a temporal appendix to soteriology but the very form of New Testament thought: everything is oriented to the turning of the ages in Christ. Second, he provides an explicit conceptualization of the already/not yet that refuses the false alternative between realized and purely future eschatology. Yet he also raises a key tension that examiners will press: how do we maintain the ontological finality of Christ’s work while affirming a genuine future consummation? If, as Hebrews says, Christ has offered a once‑for‑all sacrifice and sits at the right hand of God waiting until his enemies are made a footstool, are we speaking of two phases of one eschatological act, or of two distinct divine acts?

Here Reformed biblical theologians like Geerhardus Vos and Herman Ridderbos provide the conceptual depth and systematic integration that are essential for a Westminster defense. Vos, often called the father of **Reformed biblical theology**, did not coin the language of realized eschatology but anticipated its core insight. Teaching at Princeton in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Vos worked self‑consciously within classic **federal theology** yet shifted the center of gravity from an ordo salutis schema to the unfolding history of the covenants. In “The Pauline Eschatology” and “Biblical Theology,” Vos argued that in Christ the powers of the age to come have already broken into the present age. He attends closely to Pauline phrases like “upon whom the ends of the ages have come” and to the two‑age structure of New Testament thought. For Vos, the believer lives simultaneously in this age and the age to come, belonging by union with Christ to the eschatological world while still sojourning in the old.

Vos’s method is crucial. He integrates **covenant theology**, Christology, and eschatology. The covenant of grace is historically administered through successive epochs, yet Christ is the eschatological realization of the promises. Thus eschatology is not a detachable topic but the telic shape of every locus. Justification is a verdict from the last day brought into the present. Adoption is participation now in the filial relation whose full manifestation awaits the redemption of the body. Sanctification is the inbreaking new creation life of the Spirit amid the old creation’s groaning. Examiners will likely ask whether such talk relativizes the future or renders it superfluous. Vos’s answer is that the future is neither abolished nor duplicated but anticipated. The Spirit mediates the powers of the age to come as **firstfruits** and **down payment**, not as the complete harvest.

Herman Ridderbos, working from a similar Reformed context yet with more direct engagement with twentieth‑century New Testament scholarship, sharpened the concept of the kingdom and its present/future dimensions. In “The Coming of the Kingdom” and “Paul: An Outline of His Theology,” Ridderbos argues that the kingdom is fundamentally the **reign of God in Christ**, not primarily a place, and that this reign has been inaugurated in Jesus’s ministry, death, and resurrection. However, it is still hidden and contested, to be manifested openly at the parousia. Ridderbos emphasizes the corporate and redemptive‑historical dimension: the church is the people of the kingdom but not yet the kingdom in its consummated form. His handling of justification and the two ages shows the same inaugurated structure as Vos, but with a strong pastoral and ecclesiological orientation.

Both Vos and Ridderbos are decisive because they show that inaugurated eschatology is not an optional exegetical nuance but the deep grammar of New Testament thought. They integrate the already/not yet with **union with Christ**, the structure of **redemptive history**, and the nature of the church. Internally, among Reformed theologians, debates arise over how to balance the juridical and participatory aspects of this eschatological union, and over how to relate ordo salutis language to historia salutis categories. Some fear that an emphasis on realized eschatology could weaken the forensic distinctness of justification by merging it with transformative renewal. Under examination you must be able to insist that the already of justification is precisely its eschatological character: the last day’s verdict is imputed now to those who are in Christ, maintaining a decisive forensic‑transformative distinction while recognizing that both are eschatological gifts.

N. T. Wright represents a more recent and more controversial figure whose work has both appropriated and redirected inaugurated eschatology. In volumes like “The New Testament and the People of God,” “Jesus and the Victory of God,” and his works on Paul, Wright insists that second temple Jewish expectations of God’s kingdom, return from exile, and vindication of Israel have been redefined around Jesus’s death and resurrection. Methodologically, he employs a narrative‑historical approach, arguing that for Jesus and Paul eschatology was primarily about the end of Israel’s story in its old form and the establishment of God’s worldwide reign in and through the Messiah. Wright clearly affirms that the kingdom has been inaugurated in Jesus and that the resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the general resurrection, the launching of new creation within the old.

Wright’s distinctive moves include a reconfiguration of final judgment and justification language as primarily present, ecclesial, and covenantal. While he does not deny a future judgment or resurrection, critics within the Reformed world argue that his heavy emphasis on realized dimensions of justification and kingdom risks blurring the distinction between the present, declarative verdict and its future public manifestation. Moreover, his political‑ethical applications of inaugurated eschatology, especially his claim that Christian social and cultural work participates in new creation, raise contemporary questions about triumphalism, activism, and the nature of Christian hope.

Here the external and contemporary debates press hardest. On one side stand various forms of over‑realized eschatology, not only in the academy through existentialist readings like Bultmann’s, where eschatological language is demythologized into present decision, but in the church through prosperity theology and certain charismatic circles. In these, the blessings of the age to come are claimed as normative and exhaustive now, leading to an expectation of guaranteed healing, wealth, or victory. Over‑realization turns the **firstfruits** of the Spirit into the full harvest and leaves little room for the New Testament’s insistence that suffering, groaning, and persecution are constitutive of life between the times.

On the other side stands an over‑futurist tendency, expressed in older forms of dispensationalism and some popular evangelical eschatologies. Here the kingdom is primarily future, often restricted to an earthly millennium after Christ’s return, and the present age is a kind of ecclesial interlude. Salvation is individualized and interiorized, while the cosmos, politics, and culture belong to a doomed present order. This minimizes the New Testament witness that in Christ the **new creation** has already begun, that all authority in heaven and on earth has already been given to the risen Lord, and that the church is already the firstfruits of a renewed humanity. Under examination, you must show how both extremes distort the already/not yet tension: over‑realization by erasing the not yet, over‑futurism by erasing the already.

Defending a classic Reformed inaugurated eschatology requires drawing these threads together into a coherent account. The central thesis is that with Christ’s first advent the turning of the ages has occurred. The age to come has invaded this age in such a way that all redemptive benefits, ordinarily associated with the end, are now possessed in principle by faith in union with the risen Christ. Yet their full manifestation remains tied to the parousia, the resurrection of the body, and the final judgment. This tension must be read through the lens of **union with Christ**. In him, the believer has died and been raised; the new creation exists in the resurrected Christ and those united to him. But believers still await the redemption of their bodies and the liberation of creation from its bondage to decay. Our life is hidden with Christ in God and will be revealed when he appears.

An examiner might object that this makes the future redundant: if we already have eternal life, forgiveness, adoption, and new creation, what is left for the last day other than a change of scenery. The answer must stress both the ontological and the public character of consummation. Ontologically, what is now possessed by faith and in principle will then be possessed by sight and in full actuality. The resurrection of the body is not a mere epiphenomenon but the completion of human salvation. Theologically, the final judgment is the public vindication of God’s righteousness and the open display of his wise ordering of history. Ecclesiologically, the church will be revealed as the glorified bride without spot or wrinkle. Cosmologically, the creation will be set free into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. The not yet is not a formal add‑on but the goal toward which the already is truly oriented.

Conversely, another objection is that a strong inaugurated eschatology could open the door to triumphalist political theologies that claim the kingdom’s victory now through human cultural projects, or to social gospels that identify the kingdom with progressive political agendas. Here the internal Reformed debates intersect with external critiques. Vos and Ridderbos help avoid this error by tying the kingdom first to the person and work of Christ, and then to the church as a pilgrim community. The kingdom is indeed present wherever Christ rules by his word and Spirit, manifest in faith, love, justice, and holiness. Christian engagement in culture and politics can be understood as a penultimate witness to the coming kingdom, expressing the life of the age to come in the structures of this age. Yet the Reformed emphasis on the church as a distinct eschatological community, gathered around word and sacrament, guards against conflating the kingdom with any political order. The not yet relativizes all penultimate projects: they are meaningful anticipations, not the consummation itself.

This inaugurated structure deeply reconfigures ethics. Moral exhortations in the New Testament are consistently grounded in the indicative of the already and the imperative of the not yet. Because believers have put off the old man and put on the new, they must walk in newness of life. Because the night is far gone and the day is at hand, they are to cast off the works of darkness. Eschatology is not speculative future‑gazing but the engine of sanctification. At the same time, the not yet protects against both despair and presumption. Suffering, persecution, and remaining sin are not anomalies but marks of the interim state. Believers groan inwardly as they await adoption, yet with hope, because the present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed. Any over‑realized ethic that expects perfection now, whether individually or socially, fails to reckon with the New Testament’s theology of cross before crown.

There are also implications for sacramental theology and ecclesiology that examiners may want explored. Inaugurated eschatology frames the sacraments as signs and seals of participation in the age to come. Baptism signifies union with Christ in his death and resurrection, incorporating believers into the **eschatological people of God**. The Lord’s Supper is a communion in the body and blood of the risen Christ and a foretaste of the marriage supper of the Lamb. The church is an eschatological colony of the kingdom, a community in which the realities of the new creation are anticipatively embodied. Yet precisely because the eschaton is not fully realized, the church remains mixed, suffering, disciplined, and sin‑ridden. To identify the visible church with the consummated kingdom would be an ecclesiological over‑realization parallel to prosperity theology’s soteriological over‑realization.

Finally, inaugurated eschatology must be coordinated with **divine sovereignty**, **providence**, and **divine immutability**. Classical theism insists that God does not change or develop. The eschatological drama unfolds not because God becomes something he was not, but because God’s eternal decree unfolds in time. The already/not yet tension is not in God but in history. Christ’s once‑for‑all work has eternal significance because the eternal Son assumed our nature and entered time to accomplish redemption. There is, therefore, an asymmetry between the two comings of Christ: the first secures redemption in principle and inaugurates the kingdom; the second manifests fully what is already secured. This protects against any notion that God is, so to speak, experimenting with history or that the outcome of the eschatological conflict is in doubt.

In sum, realized versus future eschatology is not a question of choosing one pole but of articulating the structured relation between them along biblical, confessional, and redemptive‑historical lines. Dodd was right to insist that the kingdom is present in Christ but wrong to flatten the future into the present. Cullmann’s D‑Day analogy correctly captured the decisive yet incomplete character of Christ’s victory. Vos and Ridderbos embedded inaugurated eschatology into the heart of **Reformed biblical theology** and **covenant theology**, showing that every locus must be rethought in light of the two ages. Wright, with qualifications, has pressed the inaugurated framework into narrative and ethical dimensions, sometimes pressing it beyond classic Reformed boundaries. Against internal over‑realization and external over‑futurism, the best Reformed account maintains disciplined tension: the age to come has truly dawned in Christ and in the Spirit‑indwelt church, yet the full glory of resurrection, judgment, and new creation still lies ahead, summoning the church to hopeful patience, cruciform obedience, and confident witness between the times.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Realized vs future eschatology** concerns how the New Testament relates the already inaugurated **kingdom of God**, **new creation**, and **age to come** to their not yet consummated fulfillment at Christ’s return, resurrection, and final judgment.
- Decisive figures:
  - C. H. Dodd: strong **realized eschatology**, collapsing much of the future into the present ministry of Jesus.
  - Oscar Cullmann: inaugurated eschatology using the D‑Day/V‑Day analogy, affirming both decisive victory and ongoing conflict.
  - Geerhardus Vos: Reformed **biblical theology** of two ages; eschatology structures all loci through **union with Christ** and **history of redemption**.
  - Herman Ridderbos: kingdom as present reign of Christ, yet future in open manifestation; church as eschatological community.
  - N. T. Wright: narrative‑historical inaugurated eschatology, emphasizing realized kingdom and new creation with debated implications for justification and politics.
- Debates:
  - Internal: degree of realization within Reformed thought, ordo salutis vs historia salutis, kingdom and church, sacramental and ecclesial over‑realization.
  - External: liberal and existential over‑realization, dispensational and other over‑futurist models, apocalyptic readings that sever eschatology from **covenant history**.
  - Contemporary: prosperity and some charismatic over‑realized eschatologies, triumphalist political theologies, ethical perfectionism vs patient suffering, cultural engagement as anticipatory but not consummative.
- Defended position: A classic Reformed **inaugurated eschatology** in which Christ’s first coming truly introduces the **eschatological age** and its benefits into history by the Spirit, yet the full, public, and bodily **consummation** of kingdom, resurrection, and new creation awaits the parousia, so that Christian doctrine and life are lived in a structured already/not yet tension.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - Does inaugurated eschatology undermine the reality of a future judgment and resurrection?  
    No, it frames present justification and spiritual life as anticipations of, not replacements for, the future public verdict and bodily resurrection.
  - How do you avoid over‑realized triumphalism in ethics and politics?  
    By grounding the kingdom in Christ’s hidden reign and the pilgrim church, and letting the not yet relativize all cultural projects as penultimate anticipations.
  - What is the relation between justification and eschatology?  
    Justification is the eschatological verdict of the last day brought into the present for those united to Christ, without collapsing forensic declaration into transformative renewal.
  - How does the already/not yet shape the church’s experience of suffering?  
    Suffering and groaning are intrinsic to life between the times, as those who already share Christ’s life also share his cross while awaiting glory.
  - In what sense is the kingdom present now?  
    The kingdom is present as Christ’s saving reign by word and Spirit over his people, manifest in faith, holiness, and mission, yet still awaiting visible, cosmic manifestation at his return.
