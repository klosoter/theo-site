# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **eschatology** through the lens of **redemptive history** and the **already/not yet** tension inherent in **Reformed theology**. He emphasized that the **kingdom of God** is both inaugurated in Christ’s first coming and awaits consummation, integrating **realized** and **future eschatology** within a robustly theocentric, covenantal framework.

- "The kingdom of God is present wherever the rule of Christ is acknowledged, but its final manifestation awaits the consummation of history." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Christian Apologetics
- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture and Authority
- Common Grace and the Gospel

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redemptive-Historical Eschatology**
   - Eschatology is inseparable from the unfolding of **covenant history**.
   - The work of Christ marks the decisive turning point in history.
   - The church lives between the **inauguration** and **consummation** of redemption.
   - All doctrinal loci must be interpreted in light of the eschatological movement of history.
   - "History is the outworking of God’s eternal plan, culminating in Christ and awaiting its final fulfillment." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Already/Not Yet Tension**
   - The kingdom is both present and future in the life of the believer.
   - Believers experience the **firstfruits** of salvation now, but await full realization.
   - The tension guards against both over-realized and under-realized eschatologies.
   - The church’s mission is shaped by this dual reality.
   - "We must not separate what God has joined: the present reality and the future hope of the kingdom." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Christocentric Consummation**
   - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the new age.
   - All eschatological hope is centered on the person and work of Christ.
   - The future consummation is guaranteed by Christ’s victory.
   - The church’s life is oriented toward the return of Christ.
   - "The resurrection of Christ is the pledge of the final victory over sin and death." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Covenantal Framework**
   - Eschatology is grounded in the unfolding of God’s covenant promises.
   - The **covenant of grace** structures the movement from promise to fulfillment.
   - The church is the covenant community living between the times.
   - The sacraments serve as signs of both present grace and future hope.
   - "The covenant is the backbone of redemptive history, stretching from promise to fulfillment." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Antithesis and Consummation**
   - The antithesis between belief and unbelief will be fully revealed at the end.
   - The present age is marked by spiritual conflict, anticipating final judgment.
   - The consummation will vindicate God’s justice and mercy.
   - Apologetics must point to the certainty of eschatological fulfillment.
   - "The final separation of light and darkness will manifest the true meaning of history." (Christian Apologetics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s integration of **realized and future eschatology** profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and systematic theology, emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of Christ. His covenantal and redemptive-historical approach influenced generations of theologians at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. Van Til’s emphasis on the **already/not yet** dynamic remains foundational for contemporary Reformed discussions of eschatology and the church’s mission in the world.
