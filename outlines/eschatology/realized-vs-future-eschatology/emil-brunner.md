# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **eschatology** with a strong emphasis on the existential encounter between the individual and God, highlighting the tension between **realized eschatology** (the presence of salvation in Christ now) and **future eschatology** (the consummation yet to come). He rejected both extreme **futurism** and **over-realized eschatology**, instead stressing the dynamic "already/not yet" character of the **Kingdom of God** and the decisive role of **personal faith** in appropriating eschatological hope.

- "The Kingdom of God is both a present reality and a future hope." (Eternal Hope)

## Key Works

- Eternal Hope (1946)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)
- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Encounter**
    - Eschatology is not merely a doctrine of end times but a present, existential encounter with God.
    - The **Kingdom of God** is experienced wherever Christ is received in faith.
    - The future is not a fixed timeline but a personal event breaking into the present.
    - The eschatological promise is appropriated in the individual's relationship with Christ.
    - "Eschatology is not chronology, but encounter." (Eternal Hope)

2. **Already/Not Yet Tension**
    - The **Kingdom** is both inaugurated in Christ and awaiting consummation.
    - Salvation is a present reality, yet its fullness is future.
    - The believer lives in the tension between what is "already" given and what is "not yet" fulfilled.
    - This tension guards against both despair and triumphalism.
    - "We live between the times: the time of promise and the time of fulfillment." (Eternal Hope)

3. **Rejection of Over-Realized Eschatology**
    - Brunner warns against identifying the fullness of the **Kingdom** with present historical realities.
    - The church is a sign, not the fulfillment, of the eschatological hope.
    - Human history cannot be equated with the final realization of God's reign.
    - The future consummation remains a divine act, not a human achievement.
    - "The Kingdom is not a product of history, but a gift from above." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

4. **Personal Faith and Eschatological Hope**
    - Eschatological hope is appropriated through **personal faith** in Christ.
    - The future is meaningful only as it relates to the individual's encounter with God.
    - Assurance of future fulfillment is grounded in present relationship with Christ.
    - Faith transforms the believer's orientation toward both present and future.
    - "Faith is the anticipation of the future in the present." (Truth as Encounter)

5. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - Christ is the center and fulfillment of all eschatological expectation.
    - The resurrection is the decisive event inaugurating the new age.
    - All hope for the future is anchored in the person and work of Christ.
    - The **Parousia** is both a present reality in the Spirit and a future hope.
    - "The end is not a what, but a Who: Jesus Christ Himself." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s nuanced approach to **realized and future eschatology** influenced 20th-century Protestant thought by emphasizing the existential and relational dimensions of Christian hope. His articulation of the "already/not yet" dynamic contributed to ongoing discussions about the nature of the **Kingdom of God** and the role of faith in eschatological expectation. Brunner’s work remains significant for those seeking a balance between present experience and future consummation in Christian theology.
