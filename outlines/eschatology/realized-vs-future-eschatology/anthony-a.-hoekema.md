# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema advocated a balanced approach to **eschatology**, emphasizing both the **"already"** and the **"not yet"** aspects of the **kingdom of God**. He rejected both extreme **realized eschatology** (which claims all promises are fulfilled now) and a purely **futurist eschatology**, insisting that the New Testament teaches a tension between present spiritual realities and future consummation.

- "The kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope." (The Bible and the Future)

## Key Works

- The Bible and the Future
- Created in God's Image
- Saved by Grace
- "Amillennialism" in The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views (ed. Robert G. Clouse)
- "Eschatology" in Evangelical Dictionary of Theology (ed. Walter A. Elwell)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Already/Not Yet Structure of Eschatology**
    - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated in Christ’s first coming but awaits final consummation.
    - Believers experience **spiritual blessings** now, but full realization is future.
    - The New Testament presents a tension between present possession and future fulfillment.
    - This framework guards against both over-realized and under-realized eschatologies.
    - "The New Testament teaches both a present and a future aspect of the kingdom." (The Bible and the Future)

2. **Rejection of Over-Realized Eschatology**
    - Denies that all eschatological promises are fulfilled in the present age.
    - Warns against identifying the church or Christian experience with the final state.
    - Emphasizes ongoing struggle with sin and suffering before Christ’s return.
    - Maintains that ultimate victory and renewal are still future.
    - "We must not say that the kingdom has come in its fullness." (The Bible and the Future)

3. **Critique of Purely Futurist Eschatology**
    - Opposes views that postpone all kingdom realities to the end times.
    - Affirms that Christ’s resurrection and ascension inaugurated the last days.
    - Believers already participate in some eschatological blessings.
    - The church is a present sign of the coming kingdom.
    - "The age to come has already been inaugurated, though not yet consummated." (The Bible and the Future)

4. **Amillennialism and Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Advocates **amillennialism**: no literal earthly millennium, but Christ reigns now.
    - The millennium is symbolic of the present church age.
    - Final judgment and new creation occur at Christ’s return.
    - The present age is marked by both victory and suffering.
    - "The millennium is the period between the first and second comings of Christ." (The Bible and the Future)

5. **Transformation of Creation**
    - Eschatology includes the renewal of the entire **created order**.
    - The new earth is the final destiny for redeemed humanity.
    - Present creation anticipates future liberation from corruption.
    - Redemption is cosmic, not merely individual or spiritual.
    - "The new earth will be the home of redeemed humanity in its resurrection body." (The Bible and the Future)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of the **already/not yet** tension in eschatology has become a standard framework in Reformed and evangelical theology. His careful critique of both over-realized and purely futurist approaches provided clarity and balance for subsequent discussions of the **kingdom of God**. Through his influential writings, especially The Bible and the Future, Hoekema shaped contemporary understandings of **amillennialism** and the cosmic scope of redemption. His work continues to inform debates on the nature of Christian hope and the future of creation.
