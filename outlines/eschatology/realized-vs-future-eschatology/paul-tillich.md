# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **eschatology** through the lens of **existential theology**, emphasizing the **"eternal now"** and the **symbolic** nature of Christian hope. For Tillich, **realized eschatology** is not merely about future events but about the **breaking-in of the ultimate** into present existence, while the **future eschaton** remains a symbol of the fulfillment of meaning and being.

- "The Kingdom of God is always present, but it is never fulfilled in time and space." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

- Theology of Culture
- The Shaking of the Foundations

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Symbolic**
    - Eschatological language points to **ultimate concern**, not literal future events.
    - The **Kingdom of God** is a symbol for the fulfillment of meaning.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point, making eschatology existentially present.
    - The future is not a chronological expectation but a **transcendent reality** breaking into the present.
    - "Eschatological symbols are not predictions but expressions of the ultimate meaning of history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **The Eternal Now**
    - The **eternal** is present in every moment, transcending temporal distinctions.
    - Realized eschatology is experienced as the **presence of the ultimate** in the now.
    - The future eschaton is not a distant event but the depth of every present moment.
    - This view challenges purely futurist or historicist readings of Christian hope.
    - "Eternity is not endless time but the power of the future in every present." (The Protestant Era)

3. **Existential Fulfillment over Historical Consummation**
    - The focus is on **existential transformation** rather than historical completion.
    - The **new being** is realized in personal and communal life now.
    - The future serves as a symbol for the depth and meaning of present existence.
    - Historical fulfillment is secondary to existential participation in the ultimate.
    - "The new creation is not a future event but the ever-present possibility of renewal." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Already/Not Yet Tension**
    - The **Kingdom** is both already present and not yet fully realized.
    - This tension reflects the paradox of Christian existence in history.
    - The "not yet" keeps hope alive, while the "already" grounds present transformation.
    - Eschatology is both a critique of the present and a call to transformation.
    - "The Kingdom is always coming, always present, and always beyond." (The Interpretation of History)

5. **Critique of Literalism**
    - Tillich rejects **literal interpretations** of apocalyptic and eschatological texts.
    - He sees such readings as a misunderstanding of the symbolic and existential nature of Christian hope.
    - The **future eschaton** is not a timetable but a symbol of ultimate fulfillment.
    - Literalism risks idolatry by confusing symbol with reality.
    - "To take the symbols literally is to destroy their power to point beyond themselves." (Theology of Culture)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **realized and future eschatology** has profoundly influenced modern **systematic theology**, especially in existential and symbolic interpretations of Christian hope. His emphasis on the **eternal now** and the symbolic depth of eschatological language challenged both conservative futurism and liberal demythologization. Tillich’s work continues to shape discussions on the meaning of **ultimate concern** and the role of eschatology in contemporary theology. His legacy endures in the ongoing dialogue between existentialist thought and Christian doctrine.
