# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a nuanced view of **eschatology** that integrates both **realized** and **future** dimensions. While he affirmed the **already** present reality of certain spiritual benefits through **grace** and **union with Christ**, Aquinas maintained that the fullness of **beatitude**, **resurrection**, and **final judgment** remains a future hope, to be consummated at the end of history.

- "The resurrection will be the final completion of our beatitude, which begins here by grace but is perfected hereafter in glory." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q. 92, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially III and Supplementum)
- Summa Contra Gentiles (Book IV)
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians (notably ch. 15)
- De Veritate (esp. Q. 8, on resurrection)
- Compendium Theologiae

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Already/Not Yet**
    - Aquinas affirms that **grace** initiates eternal life in the soul now, but its fullness is reserved for the future.
    - The **Kingdom of God** is present in the Church and sacraments, yet awaits consummation.
    - The **beatific vision** is anticipated by faith and charity, but only fully possessed after death.
    - The tension between present spiritual realities and future fulfillment structures his eschatology.
    - "Grace is the beginning of glory in us." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 113, a. 10)

2. **Future Bodily Resurrection**
    - The resurrection of the body is a central, future event for Aquinas.
    - He insists on the **integrity of human nature**: soul and body united in final beatitude.
    - Resurrection is necessary for the full realization of **human perfection**.
    - The resurrection occurs at the end of time, not immediately after death.
    - "The soul without the body is not a complete human being." (Summa Theologiae Supplement, Q. 75, a. 1)

3. **Intermediate State**
    - Aquinas teaches that souls experience an **intermediate state** after death, before the resurrection.
    - The **blessed** enjoy the vision of God in their souls, but not yet in their bodies.
    - The **damned** suffer punishment, but await final judgment.
    - This state is provisional, awaiting the final consummation.
    - "The soul is rewarded or punished immediately after death, but not as perfectly as after the resurrection." (Summa Theologiae Supplement, Q. 69, a. 2)

4. **Final Judgment and Consummation**
    - Aquinas distinguishes between **particular judgment** at death and the **general judgment** at the end.
    - The general judgment publicly manifests God's justice and mercy.
    - The **renewal of creation** and the defeat of evil occur at this consummation.
    - The final state is one of perfect **communion with God** for the righteous.
    - "At the last judgment, the whole man will be rewarded or punished according to his works." (Summa Contra Gentiles IV, ch. 91)

5. **Beatific Vision as Ultimate End**
    - The **beatific vision** is the ultimate fulfillment of human destiny.
    - It is partially anticipated by grace, but fully realized only after resurrection.
    - The vision consists in direct, unmediated knowledge of God.
    - This vision is the source of eternal **happiness** and rest.
    - "Man's ultimate happiness consists in the contemplation of God, which is promised to us as our final reward." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 3, a. 8)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **realized** and **future eschatology** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, especially in the Roman Catholic tradition. His careful distinction between the **already** of grace and the **not yet** of glory influenced later scholastic and Reformed discussions of the **ordo salutis** and the nature of Christian hope. Aquinas’s articulation of the **beatific vision** as the telos of human life remains foundational for Catholic eschatology and continues to inform ecumenical dialogue on the relationship between present spiritual realities and future consummation.
