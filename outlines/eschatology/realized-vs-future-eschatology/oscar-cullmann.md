# Oscar Cullmann (1902–1999)

Oscar Cullmann was a leading proponent of the **"already/not yet"** framework in **New Testament eschatology**, emphasizing the tension between the **inaugurated** and **future fulfillment** of the **Kingdom of God**. He argued that the decisive victory over evil occurred in Christ’s first coming, but the final consummation remains future, thus balancing **realized eschatology** with a robust sense of **future hope**.

- "Between D-Day and V-Day the decisive battle has been won, but final victory has not yet come." ("Christ and Time")

## Key Works

- Salvation in History
- The Christology of the New Testament
- Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?
- The Early Church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Salvation History**
    - Interprets **redemptive history** as a linear progression with Christ at the center.
    - Sees the **incarnation, death, and resurrection** as the turning point in history.
    - Emphasizes the historical reality of **salvation events**.
    - Rejects cyclical or purely existential interpretations of eschatology.
    - "Primitive Christianity knows only a linear concept of time." (Christ and Time)

2. **Already/Not Yet Tension**
    - Argues that the **Kingdom of God** is both present and future.
    - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the new age, but its fullness awaits the **Parousia**.
    - Believers live in the tension between **realized** and **future eschatology**.
    - Uses the analogy of D-Day and V-Day to illustrate the overlap of the ages.
    - "The decisive battle has been won, but the war is not yet over." (Christ and Time)

3. **Centrality of the Resurrection**
    - The **resurrection of Christ** is the pivotal event in history.
    - Resurrection marks the beginning of the end times, not their completion.
    - The resurrection guarantees the future resurrection of believers.
    - Rejects Greek notions of the **immortality of the soul** in favor of bodily resurrection.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the general resurrection." (Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?)

4. **Historical Revelation**
    - God’s actions are revealed in concrete historical events.
    - Revelation is not abstract but tied to specific moments in **salvation history**.
    - The New Testament must be read as the record of these historical acts.
    - Eschatology is grounded in the reality of past, present, and future events.
    - "Revelation is always revelation in history." (Salvation in History)

5. **Hope and Expectation**
    - Maintains a strong sense of **future hope** for the consummation of God’s purposes.
    - The Christian life is marked by **expectation** and waiting.
    - The **Parousia** is essential for the completion of redemption.
    - Avoids both over-realized and under-realized eschatological errors.
    - "Christian hope is directed toward the future, toward the final victory." (Christ and Time)

## Legacy and Impact

Cullmann’s articulation of the **"already/not yet"** paradigm profoundly shaped modern discussions of **New Testament eschatology** and influenced both biblical and systematic theology. His emphasis on **salvation history** provided a corrective to existential and purely realized eschatologies, balancing the significance of Christ’s first coming with the necessity of future consummation. Cullmann’s work remains foundational for understanding the relationship between **realized** and **future eschatology** in contemporary theology.
