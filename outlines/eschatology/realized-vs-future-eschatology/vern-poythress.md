# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches **realized and future eschatology** through a robustly **biblical-theological** and **multiperspectival** lens, emphasizing the **already/not yet** structure of **redemptive history**. He maintains that the **kingdom of God** is inaugurated in Christ’s first coming but awaits consummation at his return, integrating both present and future dimensions of eschatological hope.
