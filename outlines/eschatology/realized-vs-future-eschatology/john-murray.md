# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray’s approach to **eschatology** is marked by a careful balance between the **"already"** and the **"not yet"** aspects of **redemptive history**. He emphasizes that the **inauguration** of the **kingdom of God** in Christ’s first coming does not exhaust the fullness of **eschatological hope**, which awaits consummation at Christ’s return.

- "The kingdom of God is both present and future, both realized and to be realized." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- Principles of Conduct

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology is both inaugurated and future**
    - Murray insists that the **kingdom of God** has been inaugurated in Christ’s first coming.
    - He maintains that the full realization of **redemption** awaits the **parousia**.
    - The tension between **realized** and **future** eschatology is essential for understanding the New Testament.
    - He rejects any over-realized eschatology that collapses the future into the present.
    - "The eschatological is both present and future, and the two are integrally related." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Union with Christ as the locus of eschatological blessing**
    - Believers participate in **eschatological life** through union with the risen Christ.
    - This union grounds both present spiritual realities and future hope.
    - The benefits of **regeneration**, **justification**, and **sanctification** are already applied, yet await consummation.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits of the final resurrection.
    - "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

3. **Resurrection as the hinge of realized and future eschatology**
    - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the new age, but the resurrection of believers is future.
    - The believer’s present life is shaped by the power of the resurrection.
    - The final resurrection is the ultimate realization of eschatological hope.
    - The "already" and "not yet" are inseparable in the doctrine of resurrection.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the pledge and pattern of the resurrection of his people." (Romans, NICNT)

4. **Sanctification as progressive and eschatologically oriented**
    - Sanctification is grounded in the believer’s present status but looks forward to perfection.
    - The Spirit’s work is both a present reality and a guarantee of future transformation.
    - Ethical imperatives are rooted in the tension between what is and what will be.
    - The Christian life is lived between the times, marked by both victory and anticipation.
    - "Sanctification is a process that has its goal in the eschatological perfection of the people of God." (Principles of Conduct)

5. **Covenant fulfillment in Christ**
    - Christ fulfills the promises of the **old covenant** in a way that is both inaugurated and awaiting consummation.
    - The **new covenant** realities are present, but their fullness is future.
    - The church lives in the overlap of the ages, experiencing both fulfillment and hope.
    - The continuity and discontinuity of the covenants are explained by the already/not yet dynamic.
    - "The new covenant is ratified and inaugurated, but its consummation awaits the age to come." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s nuanced articulation of the **already/not yet** structure of **eschatology** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in the interpretation of **Pauline epistles** and the doctrine of salvation. His careful exegesis and theological synthesis have provided a framework for understanding the relationship between present spiritual realities and future consummation. Murray’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of **redemptive history** and the application of eschatological categories to Christian life and ethics.
