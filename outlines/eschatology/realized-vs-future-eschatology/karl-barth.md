# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s doctrine of **eschatology** is marked by the conviction that the **Kingdom of God** has already broken into history through the person and work of **Jesus Christ**, yet its final consummation remains a future hope. Barth insists that all eschatological expectation is grounded in the reality of Christ’s resurrection and the ongoing tension between the **already** and the **not yet**.

- "The future which is promised to us is not a future which is merely awaited, but one which has already dawned in Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - Eschatology is centered on the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - The **resurrection** inaugurates the new age in history.
    - All eschatological hope is grounded in Christ’s completed work.
    - The **Kingdom of God** is both present and future in Him.
    "In Him the end has already begun." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Already/Not Yet Tension**
    - The **Kingdom** is inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - Believers live in the overlap of the ages: the old passing, the new arriving.
    - The church participates in the reality of the new creation, awaiting its fullness.
    - Eschatological fulfillment is both a present possession and a future hope.
    "We stand between the times, between the resurrection and the parousia." (Dogmatics in Outline)

3. **Revelation as Eschatological Event**
    - **Revelation** is itself an eschatological act, breaking into history.
    - God’s self-disclosure in Christ is the decisive moment of history.
    - The Word of God confronts humanity with the reality of the end.
    - Eschatology is not speculation, but the proclamation of God’s act.
    "The revelation of God is the opening up of the end in the midst of time." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

4. **Eschatology and Ethics**
    - The present ethical life is shaped by the reality of the **coming Kingdom**.
    - Christian existence is lived in hope, oriented toward God’s future.
    - The church’s mission is a sign of the new creation in the world.
    - Ethics are not autonomous, but eschatologically determined.
    "Christian ethics is the ethics of the coming day." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

5. **Rejection of Secularized Eschatology**
    - Barth rejects both **immanentist** and purely **futurist** eschatologies.
    - Eschatology is not human progress or mere future expectation.
    - The future is God’s act, not a natural development of history.
    - True eschatology resists reduction to existential or historical categories.
    "Eschatology is the breaking in of the wholly other." (The Epistle to the Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s eschatology decisively shaped twentieth-century theology by insisting on the **centrality of Christ** and the inseparability of realized and future aspects of the Kingdom. His dialectical approach challenged both liberal and conservative paradigms, emphasizing the **sovereignty of God** and the radical newness of divine action. Barth’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of **already/not yet** eschatology, especially in Reformed and ecumenical circles. His work continues to provoke reflection on the relationship between present Christian existence and the promised future.
