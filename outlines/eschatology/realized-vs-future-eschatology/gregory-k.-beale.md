# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale is a leading advocate of **inaugurated eschatology**, emphasizing the "already/not yet" tension in the New Testament’s presentation of the **kingdom of God**. He argues that many **eschatological promises** are fulfilled in Christ’s first coming, while their consummation awaits his return, thus balancing **realized** and **future eschatology** within a redemptive-historical framework.

- "The New Testament writers see the fulfillment of Old Testament eschatological prophecies as both already begun in Christ and yet to be consummated at his return." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- A New Testament Biblical Theology: The Unfolding of the Old Testament in the New
- The Temple and the Church’s Mission
- Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament (co-edited with D. A. Carson)
- The Book of Revelation (NIGTC)
- The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism (for methodological context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Inaugurated Eschatology as Central**
    - The **kingdom of God** is both present and future, inaugurated in Christ’s resurrection and ascension.
    - Old Testament **prophecies** are partially fulfilled in the church age, with final fulfillment at Christ’s return.
    - The church participates in the **new creation** reality, though not in its fullness.
    - This framework shapes Beale’s reading of both Pauline and Johannine eschatology.
    - "The end-time new creation has been inaugurated in Christ but awaits consummation." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

2. **Temple Motif and Eschatology**
    - The **temple** is a central biblical-theological symbol, fulfilled in Christ and the church.
    - Eschatological hope is tied to the expansion of God’s presence from the temple to all creation.
    - The church as the **eschatological temple** embodies the "already" aspect of fulfillment.
    - The consummated temple reality is reserved for the new heavens and new earth.
    - "The church is now the temple, but the final temple will be the new creation itself." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Fulfillment**
    - Beale stresses both continuity and transformation between Old and New Testament eschatology.
    - Fulfillment is often typological, with **Christ** as the ultimate referent.
    - The **already/not yet** schema avoids over-realized or under-realized eschatology.
    - The future consummation will surpass the inaugurated realities in glory and scope.
    - "The New Testament’s eschatology is both continuous with and transformative of Old Testament expectation." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

4. **Hermeneutics of Eschatological Prophecy**
    - Beale employs a **redemptive-historical** and typological approach to prophecy.
    - He argues that New Testament authors interpret Old Testament eschatology as inaugurated in Christ.
    - Prophetic fulfillment is often corporate and cosmic, not merely individual or national.
    - This hermeneutic undergirds his understanding of realized and future aspects.
    - "The New Testament writers interpret the Old Testament eschatologically, seeing fulfillment in Christ and the church." (Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament)

5. **Eschatology and Christian Ethics**
    - The "already" of eschatology grounds the believer’s present identity and mission.
    - Ethical exhortations are rooted in participation in the **new creation**.
    - The tension between present realization and future hope motivates perseverance.
    - The church’s life is shaped by both inaugurated blessings and eschatological expectation.
    - "Christian living is empowered by the reality that believers already participate in the new creation, though its fullness is yet to come." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions of **inaugurated eschatology** and the interpretation of biblical prophecy. His integration of **biblical theology**, typology, and redemptive-historical method has influenced both Reformed scholarship and evangelical approaches to the New Testament. By emphasizing the balance between realized and future eschatology, Beale has provided a robust framework for understanding the church’s identity and mission in the present age. His scholarship continues to inform debates on the relationship between Old and New Testament eschatological expectations.
