# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos is renowned for pioneering the distinction between **realized** and **future eschatology** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the "already/not yet" structure of **redemptive history**. He argued that the **kingdom of God** is both inaugurated in Christ’s first coming and awaits consummation at His return, thus integrating **biblical theology** with systematic categories of **eschatology**.

- "The eschatological is not merely an appendix to the doctrine of the covenant, but belongs to its very essence." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Pauline Eschatology
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation (collected essays)
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit" (article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Already/Not Yet Structure of Eschatology**
    - The **kingdom of God** is both present and future, inaugurated by Christ but awaiting final fulfillment.
    - Believers experience **eschatological blessings** now, though not in their fullness.
    - The tension between **realized** and **future eschatology** is central to understanding the New Testament.
    - This framework shapes the interpretation of **Pauline** and **Johannine** theology.
    - "The future world has, in principle, become present in the midst of the old." (Pauline Eschatology)

2. **Centrality of Redemptive History**
    - Eschatology is not a mere appendix but integral to the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - The acts of God in history progressively reveal the **eschatological goal**.
    - The Old Testament anticipates, and the New Testament inaugurates, the **eschatological age**.
    - The unity of Scripture is seen in the movement from promise to fulfillment.
    - "Revelation is not an isolated act, but a process running parallel with the history of redemption." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Christ as the Eschatological Center**
    - Jesus’ person and work inaugurate the **last days**.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the firstfruits of the **new creation**.
    - The **Spirit’s outpouring** marks the arrival of the age to come.
    - The church lives between the ages, united to Christ’s eschatological victory.
    - "The Messiah is the bearer and mediator of the eschatological state." (Pauline Eschatology)

4. **Pauline Eschatology as Paradigm**
    - Paul’s theology is structured by the tension of **already** and **not yet**.
    - Justification, adoption, and sanctification have both present and future aspects.
    - The **Spirit** is the arrabōn (down payment) of future glory.
    - The resurrection of believers is grounded in Christ’s own resurrection.
    - "The present possession of salvation is the pledge and anticipation of the future." (Pauline Eschatology)

5. **Integration of Biblical and Systematic Theology**
    - **Biblical theology** uncovers the progressive, historical unfolding of eschatology.
    - **Systematic theology** synthesizes these insights for doctrinal clarity.
    - Vos insists on the organic unity of Scripture’s eschatological message.
    - Theological method must respect both the diversity and unity of biblical revelation.
    - "Dogmatics and biblical theology are not rivals, but allies in the service of the truth." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **already/not yet** framework has profoundly shaped Reformed and evangelical approaches to **eschatology** and **biblical theology**. His influence is evident in the work of later theologians such as Ridderbos, Gaffin, and Beale, who further developed the inaugurated eschatology paradigm. Vos’s integration of **redemptive history** with systematic categories continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of the kingdom, the church, and the Christian life in the present age.
