# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s eschatology centers on the interplay between **realized eschatology**—the present experience of the **Kingdom of God** in the Church—and the expectation of a **future consummation** at the end of history. He maintains that certain eschatological realities are already inaugurated, yet insists on the ultimate fulfillment of **resurrection**, **final judgment**, and the **City of God** in the future. This dual emphasis shapes his understanding of Christian hope and the nature of the Church in the present age.

- "The Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven." (City of God, Book XX, Ch. 9)

## Key Works

- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- Sermons on the New Testament
- Letters (Epistulae)
- Confessions (for background on his theological development)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Already/Not Yet Structure of the Kingdom**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is present in the Church but awaits its final manifestation.
    - Believers participate in spiritual realities now, anticipating their fullness.
    - Augustine interprets the "first resurrection" as spiritual regeneration.
    - The "second resurrection" refers to the bodily resurrection at the end.
    "The first resurrection, then, is now, the second shall be then." (City of God, XX.9)

2. **Amillennialism and Rejection of Earthly Millennium**
    - Augustine rejects a literal thousand-year reign of Christ on earth.
    - The "millennium" is symbolic of the current **Church age**.
    - He opposes **chiliasm** as a misreading of Revelation 20.
    - The reign of the saints is spiritual, not political or earthly.
    "The Church reigns with Christ for a thousand years, meaning the whole period of its development." (City of God, XX.9)

3. **The Two Cities: Earthly and Heavenly**
    - History is a conflict between the **City of God** and the **earthly city**.
    - The two cities are intermixed until the final judgment.
    - The Church is the pilgrim community, awaiting its final home.
    - Full separation and consummation occur only at the end.
    "Two loves have made two cities: love of self, even to contempt of God; love of God, even to contempt of self." (City of God, XIV.28)

4. **Resurrection and Final Judgment as Future Events**
    - Bodily **resurrection** is a future, universal event.
    - The **final judgment** will publicly vindicate the righteous and condemn the wicked.
    - Present spiritual realities anticipate but do not replace these future acts.
    - The hope of resurrection shapes Christian life and ethics.
    "The resurrection of the body is a future event, not yet accomplished." (Enchiridion, 84)

5. **Sacramental Participation as Foretaste**
    - The **sacraments** mediate present participation in eschatological grace.
    - Baptism and Eucharist are signs of the future reality.
    - The Church’s worship anticipates the heavenly banquet.
    - Sacramental life sustains hope for the final consummation.
    "These sacraments are signs of the things to come, not the things themselves." (Letter 55)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s synthesis of **realized and future eschatology** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, especially in the development of **amillennialism** and the doctrine of the **two cities**. His framework influenced medieval, Reformation, and modern theology, providing a foundation for understanding the Church’s present mission and future hope. The tension he articulated between present spiritual realities and future consummation remains a central theme in Christian eschatological reflection.
