# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached **eschatology** with a strong emphasis on the **already/not yet** tension, affirming both the **realized** and **future** aspects of the **kingdom of God**. He argued that the work of **Christ** inaugurated the kingdom in history, yet its full consummation awaits the **second coming** and the final resurrection. Warfield’s perspective sought to balance the present reality of redemption with the hope of future fulfillment.

- "The kingdom of God is, in its essential idea, the reign of God in the hearts of men; it is, therefore, necessarily present wherever there are hearts which bow in loyalty to God." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

## Key Works

- "The Millennium and the Apocalypse" (in Biblical Doctrines)
- "The Gospel of the Resurrection"
- "The Plan of Salvation"
- Selected Shorter Writings (esp. essays on eschatology)
- The Westminster Assembly and Its Work

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Kingdom is Both Present and Future**
    - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated by Christ’s first coming but awaits full realization at his return.
    - Believers experience spiritual blessings now, yet anticipate the final consummation.
    - Warfield rejects both extreme **futurism** and an over-realized eschatology.
    - The church is the present manifestation of the kingdom, but not its final form.
    - "The kingdom is, therefore, both present and future; it is here, but it is also to come." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

2. **Christ’s Resurrection as Eschatological Inauguration**
    - The resurrection marks the beginning of the **new creation**.
    - It is the foundation for both present spiritual life and future bodily resurrection.
    - Warfield links the resurrection to the **already/not yet** dynamic.
    - The resurrection is a pledge of the ultimate renewal of all things.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the eschatological resurrection." ("The Gospel of the Resurrection")

3. **Progressive Realization of Redemption**
    - Redemption unfolds in history, moving toward its final goal.
    - The **Holy Spirit** applies Christ’s work progressively in believers and the world.
    - Warfield emphasizes the historical development of God’s redemptive plan.
    - The church’s mission is part of this ongoing realization.
    - "The process of redemption is a progressive realization of the kingdom." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

4. **Future Consummation and Final Judgment**
    - The ultimate fulfillment of God’s promises awaits the **second coming**.
    - Warfield affirms a future, visible return of Christ and bodily resurrection.
    - Final judgment will publicly vindicate God’s people and establish justice.
    - The new heavens and new earth are the final state of redeemed creation.
    - "The consummation of the kingdom awaits the return of the King." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

5. **Rejection of Premillennialism**
    - Warfield defends an **amillennial** or postmillennial reading of Revelation 20.
    - He interprets the millennium as the present church age, not a future earthly reign.
    - The binding of Satan and reign of saints are spiritual realities now.
    - The final victory comes at Christ’s return, not before.
    - "The millennium is the present reign of the saints with Christ in the intermediate state." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s nuanced approach to **realized and future eschatology** shaped Reformed thought by emphasizing the balance between present spiritual realities and future hope. His rejection of **premillennialism** and articulation of the **already/not yet** framework influenced later theologians, especially within the Princeton tradition and confessional Presbyterianism. Warfield’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the nature of the kingdom and the unfolding of redemption in history.
