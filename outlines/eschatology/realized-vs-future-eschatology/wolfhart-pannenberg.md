# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg advanced a dynamic understanding of **eschatology** that integrates both **realized** and **future** dimensions, emphasizing the proleptic presence of the **kingdom of God** in history while maintaining the decisive significance of the **eschaton**. For Pannenberg, the **resurrection of Jesus** is the anticipatory event that grounds the present reality of salvation, yet the fullness of **God’s self-revelation** and the consummation of history remain future-oriented.

- "The future of God is not simply a future that will one day become present, but it is the power of the future that already determines the present." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

- Revelation as History (ed., with contributions)
- Basic Questions in Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as the Horizon of All Theology**
    - Eschatology is not a separate doctrine but the framework for all Christian theology.
    - The meaning of history and revelation is determined by its ultimate future.
    - The **kingdom of God** is both a present reality and a future hope.
    - All doctrines must be interpreted in light of their eschatological fulfillment.
    - "Christian faith lives from the future of Jesus Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Proleptic Realization of the Future**
    - The resurrection is the prolepsis (anticipatory realization) of the end.
    - Present experience of salvation is grounded in the future’s intrusion into history.
    - The church lives in the tension between the 'already' and the 'not yet.'
    - The Spirit mediates the presence of the future in believers’ lives.
    - "The future is already present in the resurrection of Jesus." (Jesus—God and Man)

3. **Historical Revelation and Universal History**
    - Revelation is not a private event but occurs in universal history.
    - The meaning of events is only fully disclosed at the end of history.
    - The resurrection is a historical event with universal significance.
    - Eschatology provides the key to interpreting all historical reality.
    - "Only the end can reveal the meaning of the whole." (Revelation as History)

4. **Christology and Eschatology are Inseparable**
    - Jesus’ resurrection is the foundation of both realized and future eschatology.
    - Christ is the center of history and the anticipation of its fulfillment.
    - The identity of Jesus is fully revealed only in the eschaton.
    - The church’s proclamation is oriented toward the coming consummation.
    - "The Christ event is the anticipation of the end of all things." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **God’s Self-Revelation as Eschatological Event**
    - God’s revelation is completed only in the future.
    - The openness of history is essential to God’s self-disclosure.
    - Human knowledge of God is provisional, awaiting final consummation.
    - The future of God draws all creation toward its goal.
    - "God’s deity is his rule over the future." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s integration of **realized and future eschatology** has profoundly influenced modern systematic theology, especially in discussions of **history**, **revelation**, and the **kingdom of God**. His insistence on the eschatological horizon as the interpretive key for all doctrine challenged both existentialist and purely future-oriented eschatologies. Pannenberg’s work continues to shape ecumenical dialogue and remains a touchstone for theologians wrestling with the relationship between **history** and **eschaton**.
