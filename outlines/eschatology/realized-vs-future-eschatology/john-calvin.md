# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s eschatology maintains a careful balance between the **already** and the **not yet** of redemptive history. He affirms that believers experience genuine participation in **Christ’s kingdom** and **regeneration** now, while also emphasizing the future consummation of all things at the **final judgment** and **resurrection**. Calvin’s approach resists speculative timelines, focusing instead on the present reality of union with Christ and the hope of future glory.

- "We are said to be already in possession of the heavenly kingdom, and yet we are still pilgrims on the earth." (Institutes 3.25.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 3, chapters 24–25)
- Commentaries on 1 Corinthians (esp. ch. 15)
- Commentary on 1 Thessalonians
- Sermons on 2 Timothy

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Kingdom is Present and Future**
    - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated in Christ’s first coming but awaits full realization at his return.
    - Believers are spiritually transferred into Christ’s reign now, yet the visible reign is future.
    - Calvin rejects the notion of a visible, earthly millennium before the final state.
    - The church’s present experience is marked by both victory and suffering.
    - "The kingdom of Christ is begun in us, but it is by hope that it is completed." (Institutes 3.25.2)

2. **Union with Christ Grounds Eschatological Blessings**
    - All present and future eschatological benefits flow from **union with Christ**.
    - Justification and sanctification are present realities, but glorification is future.
    - The Spirit is the guarantee and firstfruits of the coming inheritance.
    - Assurance of salvation is rooted in Christ’s finished work, not in speculative prophecy.
    - "We do not yet see the kingdom of God with our eyes, but we possess it by faith." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians 15:24)

3. **Resurrection as the Consummation**
    - The **bodily resurrection** is the climactic event of future eschatology.
    - Calvin insists on the continuity of the present body with the resurrected body.
    - The resurrection is tied to Christ’s own resurrection as firstfruits.
    - Hope in resurrection shapes Christian perseverance and ethics.
    - "We shall be raised, not to another life, but to the same life, only renewed." (Institutes 3.25.8)

4. **Final Judgment and the Renewal of All Things**
    - The **final judgment** will publicly vindicate the righteous and condemn the wicked.
    - The present age is marked by anticipation and longing for this final reckoning.
    - The renewal of the cosmos is integral to Calvin’s eschatological hope.
    - Calvin warns against idle speculation about the time or manner of Christ’s return.
    - "The day of the Lord will be the revelation of things now hidden." (Commentary on 2 Timothy 4:1)

5. **Pastoral Focus: Eschatology Shapes Christian Life**
    - Calvin’s eschatology is practical, urging watchfulness and hope.
    - The tension of the “already/not yet” calls believers to perseverance amid suffering.
    - Assurance of future glory motivates present holiness and service.
    - Eschatological hope is meant to comfort the afflicted and humble the proud.
    - "Let us not be ashamed to be still learners, while we live in this world." (Institutes 3.25.10)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s nuanced articulation of **realized and future eschatology** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, emphasizing both the present benefits of salvation and the hope of final consummation. His rejection of speculative millennialism and focus on union with Christ set a pattern for later confessional standards. Calvin’s pastoral approach to eschatology continues to influence preaching, catechesis, and Christian ethics within the Reformed tradition.
