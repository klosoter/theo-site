# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann’s eschatology places **hope** at the center of Christian theology, insisting that **eschatology** is not a peripheral doctrine but the driving force of all Christian thought and practice. He emphasizes the dynamic tension of the **already/not yet** in the **Kingdom of God**, grounding Christian life in the promised **future of God** and the transformative power of resurrection.

- "From first to last, and not merely in the epilogue, Christianity is eschatology, is hope, forward looking and forward moving..." ("Theology of Hope")

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Church in the Power of the Spirit (1975)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as the Center of Theology**
    - Eschatology is foundational, not secondary, to Christian theology.
    - The **future of God** determines the meaning and direction of history and faith.
    - Christian doctrine and ethics are shaped by anticipation of God's promised future.
    - The resurrection of Christ grounds hope for the transformation of all things.
    - "Eschatology cannot be one element of Christian doctrine. Rather, the eschatological outlook is characteristic of all Christian proclamation, of every Christian existence and of the whole Church." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Already/Not Yet Tension**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is inaugurated in Christ but awaits final consummation.
    - Believers live between the **realized** presence of salvation and its **future** fulfillment.
    - This tension energizes Christian mission and ethical engagement.
    - The church is called to be a sign and foretaste of the coming kingdom.
    - "The eschatological future has already begun in Christ, but it is not yet completed." (Theology of Hope)

3. **Hope as Transformative Praxis**
    - Christian hope calls for active participation in God’s redemptive work.
    - Expectation of the future motivates social, political, and ecological transformation.
    - Eschatology inspires resistance against injustice and suffering now.
    - The church embodies hope through acts of liberation and reconciliation.
    - "Those who hope in Christ can no longer put up with reality as it is, but begin to suffer under it, to contradict it." (Theology of Hope)

4. **Open Future and Divine Promise**
    - The future is genuinely open, shaped by the **promises of God**.
    - God’s promises create new possibilities and freedom for humanity and creation.
    - Eschatology is grounded in the faithfulness of God, not human progress or despair.
    - The future is not a projection of the present but a new creation initiated by God.
    - "The promise of the future creates its own horizon of expectation and action." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Universal Scope of Eschatological Renewal**
    - Eschatology includes not only individual salvation but the renewal of all creation.
    - The resurrection points to the transformation of the cosmos, not just souls.
    - The **future of God** involves justice, peace, and reconciliation for all.
    - The church anticipates and participates in the universal restoration promised in Christ.
    - "God’s eschatological kingdom embraces the whole of reality, not just the church or the soul." (The Coming of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s integration of **realized and future eschatology** has profoundly shaped contemporary theology, especially in **political theology**, liberation thought, and ecological ethics. His vision of hope as a transformative force has inspired movements for justice and renewal within and beyond the church. Moltmann’s eschatological emphasis continues to challenge theologians to ground Christian life and doctrine in the promise of God’s coming future.
