# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **eschatology** with a strong emphasis on the dynamic tension between the **already** and the **not yet** of redemptive history. He argued that **realized eschatology** and **future eschatology** are not mutually exclusive but are integrally related within the unfolding of **salvation history**, with the believer experiencing both the inaugurated and the consummated aspects of the **kingdom of God**.

- "The New Testament speaks of a tension between the present possession and the future expectation, between the already and the not yet." (The Return of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Return of Christ (De Wederkomst van Christus)
- The Second Vatican Council and the New Catholicism
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Perseverance
- Studies in Dogmatics: The Work of Christ
- Studies in Dogmatics: The Return of Christ

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as the Fulfillment of Redemptive History**
    - Eschatology is not an isolated doctrine but the culmination of **God’s redemptive work**.
    - The **already/not yet** tension is rooted in the historical acts of God, especially in Christ.
    - The present experience of salvation anticipates its future completion.
    - The church lives in the overlap of the ages, marked by both fulfillment and expectation.
    - "Eschatology is not a separate appendix to dogmatics, but the perspective from which the whole of dogmatics must be viewed." (The Return of Christ)

2. **The Centrality of Christ’s Resurrection**
    - The resurrection is the decisive event inaugurating the **eschatological age**.
    - Believers participate in the new life now, but await its full manifestation.
    - The resurrection guarantees both present renewal and future hope.
    - The resurrection is both a historical event and a pledge of the final consummation.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new creation, but not its completion." (The Return of Christ)

3. **The Kingdom of God: Already and Not Yet**
    - The **kingdom** is present in Christ’s ministry but awaits its final realization.
    - The church embodies the kingdom’s presence while longing for its consummation.
    - The tension shapes Christian ethics and mission in the world.
    - The kingdom’s fullness is tied to the **parousia** (return of Christ).
    - "The kingdom is present as a reality, but it is also a promise that points to the future." (The Return of Christ)

4. **Hope as a Defining Mark of Christian Existence**
    - Christian hope is anchored in both present realities and future promises.
    - Hope motivates perseverance amid suffering and incompleteness.
    - The believer’s life is characterized by anticipation of the **new creation**.
    - Hope is not escapism but engagement with the world in light of God’s promises.
    - "Hope is not a vague expectation, but the certainty rooted in God’s faithfulness." (Faith and Perseverance)

5. **Critique of Over-Realized or Under-Realized Eschatology**
    - Overemphasis on realized eschatology neglects the future dimension of redemption.
    - Under-realized eschatology fails to appreciate the present realities of salvation.
    - True biblical eschatology maintains the dialectic of fulfillment and expectation.
    - The church must resist both triumphalism and pessimism.
    - "The New Testament does not allow us to dissolve the tension between the already and the not yet." (The Return of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced articulation of **realized and future eschatology** has shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the **already/not yet** dynamic. His work provided a corrective to both existential and overly futuristic readings of eschatology, emphasizing the unity of redemptive history. Berkouwer’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of the **kingdom of God** and the role of hope in Christian life, making his contributions foundational for systematic theology.
