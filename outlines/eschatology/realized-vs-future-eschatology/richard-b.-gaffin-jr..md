# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **eschatology** emphasizes the inseparability of the **"already" and "not yet"** dimensions of **redemptive history**. He argues that the **resurrection of Christ** inaugurates the **realized eschatological** age, while the fullness of **consummation** remains future, shaping the believer’s present experience and hope.

- "The New Testament presents the resurrection of Christ as the beginning of the eschatological resurrection, the inauguration of the age to come." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (in The Glory of the Atonement, eds. Hill & Letham)
- "The Eschatology of the New Testament" (in Biblical Hermeneutics: Five Views)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology is Central to Pauline Theology**
    - Paul’s theology is structured by the tension between the **already inaugurated** and the **not yet consummated** kingdom.
    - The resurrection of Christ marks the **inauguration** of the new creation.
    - Believers participate in eschatological realities now, but await their **full realization**.
    - The **order of salvation** is inseparable from the order of eschatology.
    - "Eschatology is not an appendix to Paul's thought but its very framework." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Union with Christ as Eschatological Participation**
    - **Union with Christ** brings believers into the benefits of his resurrection now.
    - The Spirit mediates present participation in the **age to come**.
    - Justification, sanctification, and glorification are all rooted in this union.
    - The believer’s life is marked by both **realized** and **future** eschatological realities.
    - "To be in Christ is to be in the new creation; the eschatological age has dawned." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **The Resurrection as the Pivot of Eschatology**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the **firstfruits** of the general resurrection.
    - The resurrection inaugurates the **new age** but does not exhaust it.
    - The believer’s resurrection life is both present (spiritual) and future (bodily).
    - The resurrection event structures the entire **redemptive-historical** timeline.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the end." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **The Spirit as the Agent of Eschatological Realization**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the down payment and guarantee of future inheritance.
    - Pentecost marks the outpouring of eschatological blessings into the present.
    - The Spirit’s work is both a present reality and a pledge of future consummation.
    - Spiritual gifts and sanctification are signs of the **already/not yet** tension.
    - "The gift of the Spirit is the eschatological gift par excellence." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutics**
    - Scripture must be read in light of the unfolding **history of redemption**.
    - The **already/not yet** framework is essential for biblical interpretation.
    - Christ’s person and work are the center of all eschatological fulfillment.
    - The church lives between the times, shaped by both fulfillment and hope.
    - "Biblical theology is eschatologically oriented from beginning to end." ("The Eschatology of the New Testament")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed understanding of **realized and future eschatology**, especially in Pauline studies. His emphasis on the **already/not yet** framework has influenced biblical theology, hermeneutics, and the doctrine of salvation. By rooting eschatology in union with Christ and the resurrection, Gaffin has provided a robust theological basis for understanding the Christian life as both inaugurated and anticipatory. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the centrality of eschatology in all of theology.
