# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann’s approach to **eschatology** is marked by his emphasis on **realized eschatology**, interpreting the New Testament’s apocalyptic language existentially rather than as predictions of future historical events. For Bultmann, the **kerygma** proclaims the decisive act of God in Christ, which confronts individuals in the present, making **eschatological fulfillment** a present reality rather than a future hope. This demythologizing project reorients eschatology from cosmic expectation to existential decision.

- "Eschatology is not a doctrine of the future, but a doctrine of the present." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Kerygma and Myth (1948, ed. Hans Werner Bartsch)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologizing Eschatology**
    - Interprets apocalyptic language as mythological, not literal.
    - Seeks the existential meaning behind biblical eschatological imagery.
    - Argues that myth must be translated into existential categories.
    - Rejects a future, cosmic fulfillment in favor of present significance.
    - "The mythical eschatology is only the form in which the message is expressed." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Realized Eschatology**
    - Eschatological fulfillment occurs in the present encounter with the kerygma.
    - The decisive event is the proclamation of Christ, not a future apocalypse.
    - Faith is an existential response to God’s act in the present.
    - The "now" of decision is the true eschatological moment.
    - "The eschatological event is not a cosmic catastrophe but the coming of the word of God." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Interpretation**
    - Employs Heideggerian existentialism to interpret biblical texts.
    - Focuses on individual existence, decision, and authenticity.
    - Eschatology is about personal transformation, not cosmic events.
    - The future is redefined as the moment of existential encounter.
    - "What matters is not the future but the present encounter with the word." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Critique of Apocalyptic Expectation**
    - Views early Christian apocalyptic as culturally conditioned.
    - Maintains that literal expectation of Christ’s return is untenable.
    - Argues that the New Testament’s urgency is existential, not chronological.
    - Sees the delay of the parousia as theologically irrelevant.
    - "The expectation of the imminent end is not essential to the Christian proclamation." (Kerygma and Myth)

5. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is the locus of eschatological reality.
    - The kerygma confronts each person with the demand for decision.
    - Eschatological hope is realized in the present through faith.
    - The church’s task is to proclaim this existential message, not predict the future.
    - "The kerygma itself is the eschatological event." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s **realized eschatology** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **New Testament studies** and existential interpretation. His demythologizing program provoked intense debate, influencing both supporters and critics in their understanding of eschatology’s meaning and relevance. While his rejection of future-oriented eschatology remains controversial, Bultmann’s focus on the existential dimension of faith continues to inform discussions of the **kingdom of God** and the nature of Christian hope.
