### ESSAY
Realized versus future eschatology names a structural decision about the New Testament’s **kingdom of God**: whether the last things are essentially present realities to be grasped now or future events awaiting consummation when Christ returns. Scripture’s own grammar is paradoxical. Believers have passed from death to life and yet await the redemption of their bodies. The powers of the age to come have broken into history, yet we still pray for the kingdom to come. The question is not whether there is both a present and a future dimension but how they are related, what each entails, and which controls our reading of the whole. I will defend a Vosian, Reformed **inaugurated eschatology** in which the decisive victory has already been accomplished in the death and resurrection of Christ and the outpouring of the Spirit, while the full harvest belongs to the Parousia, the **resurrection of the body**, and the renewal of creation. This position preserves the integrity of the **two-age schema**, safeguards the once-for-all character of Christ’s work, and grounds the church’s mission and holiness in a pilgrim posture that resists triumphalism.

C. H. Dodd is the pivotal architect of modern realized eschatology. Writing in The Parables of the Kingdom and The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel, Dodd argued that Jesus proclaimed the kingdom not as an imminent catastrophe nor as a distant hope but as a present reality. The time is fulfilled and the kingdom has come upon you. For Dodd, the eschatological crisis is realized in the encounter with Jesus’ word and deeds. Judgment is not primarily a future assize but a present sifting that divides those who respond from those who refuse. He foregrounded the perfect tense of sayings like the kingdom has come upon you and the strong realized statements of John such as whoever hears my word has eternal life and has passed from death to life. Dodd reconfigured apocalyptic into a theology of presence: the eschaton is an event in history realized in Jesus’ ministry. His method combined form-critical sensitivity to parabolic speech with a theological reading of Johannine realized themes. He was reacting against both nineteenth-century moralized liberalism and Schweitzer’s consistent eschatology that made Jesus a failed apocalyptic prophet. Dodd preserved ethical relevance and present power without adopting Schweitzer’s catastrophic literalism.

Dodd’s contribution cannot be dismissed. He saw that Jesus’ ministry is not preparation only but is itself the arrival of Israel’s promised end. Yet his dominance of Johannine idiom swamps the New Testament’s forward push. His method attenuates the bodily, visible, cosmic scope of the future and verges on allegorizing the apocalyptic strands. When all judgment is now, what remains for the last day except disclosure of what has already occurred? His realized emphasis can morph into ecclesial or ethical immanentism, and historically it prepared the ground for political theologies that identified the kingdom with social programs. A Westminster examiner will ask whether Johannine realized language can set the controlling horizon of Pauline and Synoptic futurity. The answer must be no. John himself preserves a clear future eschatology. The hours come and now is does not obliterate the hour that is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice. If Dodd gives one indispensable corrective to catastrophic futurism, he does so by a methodological reduction that obscures the **resurrection of the body** and the open horizon of hope.

Geerhardus Vos offers the most profound Reformed alternative. In Pauline Eschatology and Biblical Theology, Vos established the **two-age schema** as the backbone of redemptive history: this age characterized by corruption and death and the age to come characterized by righteousness and life. For Vos, the eschaton belongs to the new creation that terminates history at Christ’s return, yet by virtue of Christ’s resurrection and Pentecost the powers of the world to come have invaded this age. The believer is raised with Christ, seated with him in the heavenly places, and indwelt by the Spirit as firstfruits and arrabōn. The key is **union with Christ**. What is future for the cosmos is already real for the person in Christ by participation. Justification renders a verdict from the last day into the present on the basis of Christ’s finished work. Adoption installs an eschatological sonship that awaits public manifestation. Sanctification is consequential, not constitutive, of the kingdom’s presence. Vos moves with exegetical rigor across Romans, Corinthians, Ephesians, and Hebrews. He reads 1 Corinthians 15 not as a mythmaking charter but as an eschatological ontology: the last Adam has become life-giving Spirit, not by conversion into spirit but by exaltation to bestow the Spirit of the age to come.

Vos’s method exemplifies **federal theology**’s covenantal architecture. The covenants of works and grace frame history as teleological, and the last Adam’s obedience has eschatological value. The Sabbath ordinance is proleptic of eschatological rest, which Hebrews locates both as inaugurated and as still remaining for the people of God. Vos insists that the peak of redemptive history has come and that the church lives between resurrection and Parousia. Yet he preserved a robust futurity. Firstfruits does not swallow harvest. Already does not mute not yet. If pressed whether Vos overwrites Synoptic kingdom parables by Pauline categories, the answer is that he integrates them. The mustard seed and leaven figure the kingdom’s unobtrusive yet real presence, while the separation parables insist on a final crisis at the consummation. Vos places both under the larger plot of the two ages. His central contribution is to interpret realized blessings as participatory and forensic intrusions of the future grounded in union with the risen Christ, not as the abolition of the future event of judgment and renewal.

Between Dodd and Vos stands Oscar Cullmann, whose Christ and Time made the controlling metaphor for the twentieth century: D-Day and V-Day. Cullmann insists on salvation history. The midpoint of time is the Christ event. The decisive battle has been won, yet the war is not over. The church stands between victory and consummation. Cullmann criticized Dodd’s abolishing of futurity and also rejected Schweitzer’s thoroughgoing futurism by arguing for a real inbreaking of the eschaton. He paid close attention to temporality in the New Testament, distinguishing chronos and kairos in terms of salvation-historical significance rather than metaphysics. He anchored inaugurated eschatology in the resurrection as the new creation. Cullmann’s analogy is often caricatured, but its force is theological: a decisive, irreversible victory has been achieved in history, but the full surrender of the enemy awaits a future day. The Spirit mediates this interval by making present the powers of the age to come. Cullmann’s stress on historical sequence and concrete acts helped rescue eschatology from existential privatization without falling into date-setting or speculation.

If Dodd realized eschatology historically and Cullmann inaugurated it historically, Rudolf Bultmann existentialized it. For Bultmann, apocalyptic myth is a first-century vehicle for a timeless kerygma. The true eschaton is the moment of decision in which the word confronts the hearer. The last things become the last decision: authentic existence in faith versus inauthenticity in the world. Judgment, resurrection, and new creation are mythic symbols of the radical summons to self-understanding before God in Christ. Bultmann rightly saw that eschatology cannot be reduced to calendar events and that the gospel demands existential appropriation; he stripped away the curiosity of speculative timetables. Yet his demythologizing amputates the church’s hope by dissolving historical content into existential categories. The **resurrection of the body** becomes nonessential, the Parousia a metaphor, the Spirit’s arrabōn a poetic trope. To his defenders who say he preserved eschatology’s seriousness by internalizing it, the response is that the New Testament stakes salvation on acts of God in real time, culminating in a future judgment and bodily renewal. Without that, the ethical summons floats free from the Christian story and can be absorbed into generic moral authenticity. A Westminster candidate must be ready to insist that we do not demythologize resurrection into decision because Paul anchors faith’s truth in an empty tomb and a future raising.

George Eldon Ladd consolidated evangelical inaugurated eschatology in The Presence of the Future. Ladd adopted a historic premillennial stance, yet his central contribution is not millennial scheme but the kingdom’s dual presence and futurity. He argued that the kingdom is both dynamic reign and eschatological realm. The powers of the age to come operate now in exorcisms, healings, and especially in the Spirit’s regenerative work, while the kingdom as realm awaits the Parousia. He rejected Dodd’s realized approach by insisting on the future kingdom, and he rejected dispensational futurism by insisting on the kingdom’s present power. His exegesis of the Synoptic gospels foregrounds the already in Jesus’ miracles as the strong man bound and the final victory pledged. In Paul, he stressed the now of justification and the not yet of glorification. Ladd’s middle path helped many evangelicals integrate mission and hope, holiness and patience, without collapsing into triumphalism or deferral. Where Ladd needs correction is on ecclesiology and sacramental theology, where Reformed **federal theology** can more robustly articulate how Word and sacrament are **sacramental pledge** of the future and means of present participation.

Within the Reformed tradition, internal debates sharpen the edge. Amillennialism, as classically articulated in Augustine and Reformed confessions, reads the millennium of Revelation 20 as the present reign of Christ in heaven and the church’s pilgrim state, with persecution and gospel advance coexisting until the last day. Postmillennialism projects a historical triumph of the gospel in time before Christ’s return. Historic premillennialism expects a future earthly reign of Christ after his return. All three can affirm inaugurated eschatology, yet they distribute the weight differently. Amillennialism best preserves the New Testament’s tension between suffering and hope and avoids over-realized triumphalism. Postmillennialism is vulnerable to identifying the kingdom with cultural achievement and to misreading the parables’ growth as assured civilizational dominance. Historic premillennialism fortifies the future hope but can risk deferring kingdom ethics too sharply. A Westminster defense can affirm amillennial inaugurated eschatology as most coherent with the New Testament’s apocalyptic realism and with the confessional stress on the last judgment, the general resurrection, and the one return of Christ.

The relation of church and kingdom is another internal tension. The church is the community of the age to come, but the church is not the kingdom in total. If the church is equated with the kingdom, Dodd-like immanentism follows, and ecclesiastical power can masquerade as eschatological rule. If the church is detached from the kingdom, sacramental and communal disciplines lose eschatological force. The right path is to say the church is the primary public embassy of the kingdom’s presence under the Word, and its sacraments are **sacramental pledge** of the future feast. Baptism installs into the new age already, yet anticipates resurrection. The Supper is participation in the age to come through communion with the crucified and risen Lord, yet announces the marriage supper that is still future. Ethically, inaugurated eschatology motivates holiness as the dress rehearsal for glory and patience as the refusal to seize the kingdom by force.

External challenges clarify the stakes. Liberal realized eschatology in the wake of Dodd tended to identify the kingdom with ethical transformation and social progress. Political theologies of the mid-twentieth century, and later liberation theologies, often treated the kingdom as structures of justice in history. While justice is an integral fruit of the kingdom’s presence, the kingdom is fundamentally the redemptive reign of God in Christ through the Spirit, which produces but is not reducible to sociopolitical goods. Dispensational futurism represents the opposite temptation, to postpone the kingdom to Israel’s future or to a millennial administration, thereby marginalizing Jesus’ kingdom preaching as largely anticipatory and church life as a parenthesis. In contrast, **covenantal continuity** under **federal theology** confesses that the promises to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and that Gentile inclusion is an eschatological enlargement already in force, without denying a future salvation of Israel as Paul envisions. Consistent apocalyptic futurism, associated with Schweitzer, insisted that Jesus expected an imminent cataclysm that failed. Inaugurated eschatology responds that Jesus indeed brought the eschaton as firstfruits and pledged the consummation without error, and that the delay is soteriological patience rather than failure.

Contemporary tensions require careful navigation. Full preterism collapses futurity into the first century and must be rejected because it denies the future **resurrection of the body** and the visible return of Christ. Partial preterism has exegetical value for texts about Jerusalem’s fall but cannot exhaust the horizon of New Testament hope. Prosperity and triumphalist charismatic theologies embody a Dodd-like over-realization, reading kingdom healings and blessings as normal entitlements that erase groaning, suffering, and the cross. The corrective is Paul’s already groaning by the Spirit, where the **Spirit as arrabōn** assures hope precisely in weakness. In political theology, some identify the kingdom with democratic ideals or human rights regimes, while others use inaugurated eschatology to justify quietism. The right path is to locate political action within the pilgrim ethic, refusing both sacralization of any polity and abdication of neighbor love. N. T. Wright’s new-exodus and exile-return paradigm serves as a powerful narrative account of inaugurated eschatology, emphasizing that resurrection life is embodied and creational, not disembodied heaven. Where Wright is strongest is in combating escapist futurism; where caution is needed is not to conflate realized new-creational goods with the church’s social projects in a way that blurs the distinction of ages.

The biblical case for inaugurated eschatology is crystalline. Jesus announces that the kingdom has come near and is in your midst. His exorcisms are the finger of God, a sign that the kingdom has come upon you, meaning the reign of God is enacted in his person and mission. Yet he teaches the disciples to pray for the kingdom to come, to watch for the Son of Man, and to expect the judgment of the last day. The parables hold the tension: seed and leaven grow quietly over time, wheat and tares grow together until a final harvest. John speaks with a double tense: eternal life is present now and yet will be granted at the last day. Paul says the ends of the ages have come upon us and also that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom. He declares that believers are seated with Christ and also that creation awaits the revealing of the sons of God. Hebrews says we have come to Mount Zion and also that we await a kingdom that cannot be shaken. Revelation presents the Lamb slain and reigning and yet a final battle and judgment that are still future. The Spirit poured out is the down payment of the inheritance, not the inheritance itself. This duality is not contradiction but covenantal economy. In Christ, the verdict, life, and powers of the future are applied to us proleptically through **union with Christ**; in the world, death and futility still operate until the Parousia, when what is true in us by the Spirit becomes true of the cosmos.

Examiners will press the coherence of this scheme with classical theism. Does divine eternity and **divine simplicity** square with a real intrusion of the eschaton into time? The answer is that God’s immutable decree orders the economy without change in God. The eschatological intrusion is not a change in God but a new phase in the execution of his decree. The economy is temporal without implying temporality in the essence. Likewise, the Spirit as arrabōn does not fragment the gift of God but applies the simple God according to his ordered missions. Another likely challenge involves justification and its eschatological character. If justification is the present verdict of the last day, what do we make of future judgment according to works? The response is to affirm that the forensic verdict now is definitive and based on Christ’s righteousness, while the future judgment according to works is demonstrative of that verdict, not constitutive. Works are the evidences of new creation life, not the ground. This harmonizes Romans 2 with Romans 3 and Galatians. Similarly, adoption is real now and awaits public manifestation; sanctification is present and incomplete; glorification is sometimes spoken of as past because of the certainty of participation in Christ’s glory, while the actual transformation of the body is future.

The ethics of inaugurated eschatology are cruciform. The church is called to manifest the life of the age to come in holiness, justice, and patient suffering. This rules out triumphalism that expects unmingled victory now. It also rules out despair that shrivels hope. The Spirit’s gifts anticipate the future but do not erase the cross. Healing and miracles function as signs of the kingdom, not as the norm of unbroken health in the interval. Prosperity gospels invert the structure, making the not yet claimable now through technique or faith. On the other side, quietism forgets that the Spirit empowers real transformation. The mission of the church is to proclaim the gospel, plant churches, and form communities of new creation that anticipate the world to come while engaging in works of mercy and justice as fruits of the kingdom’s presence. Political engagement is penultimate and chastened, refusing both messianic statecraft and nihilism.

The sacramental life instantiates the tension. Baptism signifies and seals union with Christ in death and resurrection, a present participation in the eschatological Christ. Yet it is also a pledge of future resurrection. The Supper is participation in the body and blood of the Lord and a proclamation of his death until he comes. It is a foretaste of the banquet to come. The church’s Lord’s Day assembly is an embassy of the heavenly Jerusalem, a gathering of those who have come to Mount Zion, and a training in patience that longs for the day when faith will be sight.

Finally, inaugurated eschatology clarifies ecclesial identity. The church is an eschatological people, citizens of heaven, not because they escape the world but because they belong to the new creation already inaugurated in Christ. Pilgrim status is not nostalgia for the past but anticipation of the future. This identity protects against both the sacralization of culture and the gnosticizing of salvation. Creation matters because resurrection matters. Culture matters because the nations bring their glory into the New Jerusalem. Yet none of this confuses the embassy with the homeland. The embassy exists for the homeland’s sake.

Against realized eschatology in Dodd’s sense, we must say that the New Testament refuses to collapse the last day into the present. Judgment, bodily resurrection, and cosmic renewal remain future events. Against a deflationary futurism, we must say that the New Testament refuses to postpone the kingdom’s power. The Spirit is the presence of the future; the church is the firstfruits community. Vos, Cullmann, and Ladd are allies in securing this middle, while Bultmann’s existential reduction and dispensational deferrals must be resisted. The position defended here preserves the authority of Scripture’s own dual grammar. It honors the cross and resurrection as the turning point of the ages and preserves the Parousia as the finish line. It grounds justification as the now of the last verdict and gives sanctification its shape as advancing participation in resurrection life. It sustains hope that does not disappoint because it is anchored in the Spirit’s **arrabōn** and aims at the visible return of the Lord. When pressed to choose between present and future, the church answers with both, refusing to surrender either the **kingdom of God** among us or the world to come.
