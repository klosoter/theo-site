# N.T. Wright (1948– )

N.T. Wright is a leading proponent of a **"realized eschatology"** that emphasizes the **inauguration of God's kingdom** in the ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus, while also affirming the **future consummation** of God's purposes. He challenges traditional dichotomies between **"already" and "not yet"** by arguing that the New Testament presents a robust vision of **eschatological fulfillment** that is both present and future, particularly in the resurrection and the renewal of creation.

- "Jesus’ resurrection is the beginning of God’s new project not to snatch people away from earth to heaven but to colonize earth with the life of heaven." (Surprised by Hope)

## Key Works

- The Resurrection of the Son of God (2003)
- Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church (2008)
- Jesus and the Victory of God (1996)
- Paul and the Faithfulness of God (2013)
- New Testament and the People of God (1992)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
    - The **kingdom of God** began decisively in Jesus’ ministry and resurrection.
    - The **"already/not yet"** tension is central to New Testament eschatology.
    - Jesus’ resurrection signals the beginning of the **new creation**.
    - The church lives in the overlap of the **present age** and the **age to come**.
    - "The resurrection is not an odd event within the world as it is but the prototypical event within the world as it has begun to be." (The Resurrection of the Son of God)

2. **Redefinition of Resurrection Hope**
    - Resurrection is **bodily** and involves the renewal of the entire creation.
    - Rejects a **Platonic** or purely spiritualized afterlife.
    - Emphasizes the **continuity** between present creation and its future transformation.
    - The Christian hope is for **new heavens and new earth**, not escape from the world.
    - "God’s intention is not to let the world go to the dogs but to renew it." (Surprised by Hope)

3. **Eschatology and Mission**
    - The church’s mission is rooted in the reality of **Christ’s resurrection**.
    - Eschatology motivates **justice, evangelism, and transformation** in the present.
    - The **Spirit** empowers believers to anticipate and embody the coming kingdom.
    - Christian ethics are shaped by the **future hope** realized in the present.
    - "What you do in the present—by painting, preaching, singing, sewing...—will last into God’s future." (Surprised by Hope)

4. **Critique of Traditional Eschatological Schemes**
    - Challenges **disembodied heaven** and escapist eschatologies.
    - Argues that **second-temple Jewish** expectations inform New Testament eschatology.
    - Critiques both **liberal** and **conservative** misreadings of apocalyptic texts.
    - Emphasizes the **historical context** of Jesus’ and Paul’s eschatological teaching.
    - "Heaven is important, but it’s not the end of the world." (Surprised by Hope)

5. **Integration of Jewish and Christian Eschatology**
    - Sees Jesus as fulfilling **Israel’s story** and prophetic hopes.
    - The **exile and restoration** motif is central to understanding New Testament eschatology.
    - Paul’s theology is shaped by the **fulfillment of Israel’s eschatological hopes** in Christ.
    - The church is the renewed **people of God**, living between promise and fulfillment.
    - "The early Christians believed that what the creator God had done for Jesus he would do for the whole cosmos." (The Resurrection of the Son of God)

## Legacy and Impact

N.T. Wright has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **eschatology** by reframing the debate around the **inaugurated kingdom** and the **resurrection** as the center of Christian hope. His scholarship has challenged both popular and academic assumptions about the nature of the afterlife and the mission of the church. Wright’s integration of **biblical theology** and historical context has influenced pastors, theologians, and lay readers, sparking renewed interest in the **new creation** as the ultimate goal of redemption.
