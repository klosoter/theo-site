# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin developed a robust **eschatology** that emphasized the future **consummation** of redemption while affirming the present, inaugurated realities experienced by believers. He carefully distinguished between the **already** and the **not yet**, teaching that the benefits of **union with Christ** are presently enjoyed in part, but await their full realization at the **final resurrection** and **last judgment**.

- "The kingdom of Christ is begun in this life, but will be perfected in the life to come." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (vol. 3, especially the loci on eschatology)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on the State of the Soul after Death (Disputationes)
- Willem van Asselt, "Reformed Orthodoxy and Eschatology" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Inaugurated and Consummated Eschatology**
    - The **kingdom of God** is present in part but awaits future completion.
    - Turretin distinguishes between the **first resurrection** (spiritual) and the **second resurrection** (bodily).
    - Benefits of **union with Christ** are experienced now, but not in their fullness.
    - The **age to come** is marked by the visible return of Christ and the resurrection of the dead.
    "The kingdom of grace is now, but the kingdom of glory is future." (Institutes)

2. **Future Bodily Resurrection**
    - The resurrection is a central, future event for Turretin.
    - He rejects any notion that the resurrection is merely spiritual or realized in the present.
    - The resurrection involves the **reconstitution of the body** and its reunion with the soul.
    - This event marks the definitive transition to the **eternal state**.
    "The resurrection is not only of souls, but of bodies, and is yet to come." (Institutes)

3. **Intermediate State**
    - Souls are immediately with Christ after death, but await bodily resurrection.
    - The **intermediate state** is a temporary condition, not the final destiny.
    - Turretin opposes **soul sleep** and affirms conscious existence after death.
    - The fullness of salvation is not attained until the **final resurrection**.
    "The souls of the faithful enjoy God after death, but their happiness is not complete until the resurrection." (Institutes)

4. **Final Judgment as Future Event**
    - The **last judgment** is a single, future event at the end of history.
    - Turretin rejects any realized or ongoing judgment in the present age.
    - All people will be judged publicly by Christ at his return.
    - The final judgment inaugurates the **new heavens and new earth**.
    "The judgment is not daily, but will be solemn and universal at the end of the world." (Institutes)

5. **Present Spiritual Benefits, Future Fullness**
    - Believers now possess the **firstfruits of the Spirit** and are seated with Christ spiritually.
    - These benefits are a pledge and guarantee of future glory.
    - Turretin maintains the tension between present possession and future hope.
    - The **beatific vision** and full communion with God are reserved for the age to come.
    "We have the beginnings of glory now, but the consummation is reserved for the future." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinction between **realized** and **future eschatology** shaped later Reformed orthodoxy, providing a framework for understanding the tension between the **already** and the **not yet**. His influence is evident in confessional documents and in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the future bodily resurrection and final judgment. Turretin’s nuanced approach continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of **eschatological fulfillment** within systematic theology.
