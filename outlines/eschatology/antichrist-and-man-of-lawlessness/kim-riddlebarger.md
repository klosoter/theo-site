# Kim Riddlebarger (1955– )

Kim Riddlebarger is a prominent advocate of **amillennialism** within the Reformed tradition, offering a careful biblical and historical analysis of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness**. He interprets these figures not as future political leaders, but as theological realities manifest throughout the **interadvental age**, culminating in a final eschatological opposition to Christ. Riddlebarger’s approach emphasizes the continuity of **redemptive history** and the symbolic nature of apocalyptic texts.

- "The Antichrist is not a single individual who appears only at the end of the age, but a recurring figure who finds ultimate expression in the final rebellion." (The Man of Sin)

## Key Works

- The Man of Sin: Uncovering the Truth About the Antichrist (2006)
- A Case for Amillennialism: Understanding the End Times (2003)
- Contributions to The Christ of the Covenants Conference lectures
- Articles and essays in Modern Reformation and Tabletalk Magazine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Antichrist**
    - Views the **Antichrist** as a recurring reality throughout church history, not a singular future world ruler.
    - Emphasizes the symbolic and typological use of **Antichrist** language in **Scripture**.
    - Argues that the **man of lawlessness** (2 Thessalonians 2) is best understood within the context of the entire **church age**.
    - Rejects **dispensationalist** readings that isolate Antichrist to a seven-year tribulation.
    - "The biblical data points to a recurring pattern of antichristian opposition, climaxing in a final manifestation." (The Man of Sin)

2. **Redemptive-Historical Approach**
    - Interprets prophetic and apocalyptic passages through the lens of **redemptive history**.
    - Sees the struggle between Christ and Antichrist as a central motif from the first to the second coming.
    - Connects the **man of lawlessness** to broader themes of apostasy and deception in the last days.
    - Stresses the unity of **Old and New Testament** teaching on eschatological opposition.
    - "The drama of redemption includes the ongoing presence of antichristian forces until Christ returns." (A Case for Amillennialism)

3. **Ecclesiological Focus**
    - Locates the activity of the **Antichrist** primarily within the visible church, not merely in secular or political spheres.
    - Warns against false teaching and apostasy as marks of antichristian activity.
    - Highlights the importance of discernment and perseverance for the **people of God**.
    - Argues that the **man of lawlessness** arises in the context of professing Christianity.
    - "The greatest danger comes not from outside the church, but from within." (The Man of Sin)

4. **Christological Victory**
    - Affirms that Christ has already decisively defeated the powers of evil through his death and resurrection.
    - Teaches that the final manifestation of the **Antichrist** will be destroyed by the **parousia** (second coming).
    - Emphasizes the assurance and hope believers have in the ultimate triumph of Christ.
    - Connects the defeat of the **man of lawlessness** to the consummation of the **kingdom of God**.
    - "The Lord Jesus will overthrow the man of lawlessness with the breath of his mouth." (The Man of Sin)

5. **Rejection of Speculative Identification**
    - Critiques attempts to identify the **Antichrist** with specific historical or political figures.
    - Stresses the danger of sensationalism and date-setting in eschatology.
    - Calls for a sober, exegetical approach rooted in the **Reformed confessions**.
    - Encourages the church to focus on faithfulness rather than speculation.
    - "We must resist the temptation to read the headlines into the biblical text." (A Case for Amillennialism)

## Legacy and Impact

Riddlebarger has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed eschatology**, especially regarding the interpretation of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness**. His work has provided a robust alternative to dispensationalist and futurist readings, grounding eschatological expectation in the ongoing struggle between Christ and antichristian forces throughout the church age. Through his writings and teaching, he has encouraged a biblically grounded, hope-filled vigilance within the church. His influence endures in both academic and pastoral circles, particularly among those committed to **amillennialism**.
