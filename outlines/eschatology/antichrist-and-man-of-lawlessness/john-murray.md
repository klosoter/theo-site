# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the topic of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** with careful exegesis, emphasizing the continuity of **biblical prophecy** and the centrality of **redemptive history**. He maintained a cautious stance, avoiding speculative identification, and instead focused on the eschatological significance of these figures within the unfolding of **God’s sovereign plan**.

- "The Antichrist is not simply a past phenomenon nor merely a future expectation, but a present reality in the ongoing conflict between truth and error." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT, especially commentary on Romans 11 and 2 Thessalonians 2 references)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "The Advent of Christ and the Antichrist" (article in The Presbyterian Guardian)
- "Principles of Conduct" (for broader eschatological context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scriptural Centrality in Eschatology**
    - Emphasizes the authority of **Scripture** in defining the Antichrist and man of lawlessness.
    - Rejects extra-biblical speculation and insists on exegetical restraint.
    - Sees **2 Thessalonians 2** as the primary locus for understanding the man of lawlessness.
    - Interprets prophetic passages in light of the whole **redemptive-historical** narrative.
    - "We must be governed by the express teaching of Scripture and not by conjecture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Antichrist as a Principle and Person**
    - Recognizes both a recurring principle of **antichrist** and the expectation of a climactic personal manifestation.
    - Draws on **Johannine** and **Pauline** texts to support a dual aspect.
    - Warns against reducing the Antichrist to a mere symbol or historical figure.
    - Affirms the future, personal dimension as consistent with **Reformed eschatology**.
    - "There is both the spirit of antichrist and the person of Antichrist." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Man of Lawlessness as Eschatological Opponent**
    - Identifies the man of lawlessness as a distinct eschatological adversary.
    - Connects this figure to the final rebellion against **Christ’s lordship**.
    - Stresses the role of **deception** and counterfeit signs in his activity.
    - Maintains that his revelation is restrained until the appointed time.
    - "The man of lawlessness is the supreme embodiment of opposition to God." (Romans, NICNT)

4. **Christ’s Ultimate Victory**
    - Asserts the certainty of **Christ’s triumph** over all antichristian forces.
    - Interprets the destruction of the man of lawlessness as an act of Christ’s **parousia**.
    - Emphasizes the hope and assurance for believers in the midst of eschatological conflict.
    - Grounds this victory in the completed work of **redemption**.
    - "The Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth." (Romans, NICNT)

5. **Pastoral Caution and Watchfulness**
    - Urges the church to be vigilant against present manifestations of antichristian error.
    - Warns against sensationalism and date-setting in eschatology.
    - Encourages discernment rooted in **sound doctrine**.
    - Calls for steadfastness in faith amid increasing opposition.
    - "The church must ever be on guard against the encroachments of the antichristian spirit." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful, exegetically grounded approach to the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** has shaped Reformed eschatological thought, especially in the Westminster tradition. His emphasis on **biblical authority** and avoidance of speculative excess provided a model for responsible theological reflection. Murray’s work continues to influence pastors and scholars seeking to balance doctrinal fidelity with pastoral sensitivity in addressing eschatological themes.
