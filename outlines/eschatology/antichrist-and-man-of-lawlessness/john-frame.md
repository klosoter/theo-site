# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the topic of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** through the lens of **biblical theology** and **Reformed eschatology**, emphasizing the ongoing reality of opposition to Christ throughout history. He situates these figures within the broader context of **redemptive history**, interpreting them as both historical and recurring manifestations of rebellion against God's rule, rather than ascribing to a strictly futurist or preterist reading. Frame's analysis is shaped by his commitment to the authority of **Scripture** and the centrality of **Christ's lordship**.

- "The antichrist is not merely a future individual, but a recurring pattern of opposition to Christ that reaches its climax in history." (Systematic Theology, p. 1084)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Biblical Theology Shapes Eschatology**
    - Frame insists that **eschatological figures** like the Antichrist must be understood within the unfolding narrative of **redemptive history**.
    - He rejects speculative identifications, focusing instead on the biblical text and its canonical context.
    - The **man of lawlessness** is interpreted as a recurring type, not only a single end-times figure.
    - Frame emphasizes the unity of **Old and New Testament** teaching on opposition to God’s kingdom.
    - "The biblical story is one of conflict between Christ and antichrist, culminating in Christ’s victory." (Systematic Theology, p. 1085)

2. **Christ’s Lordship Over All History**
    - The sovereignty of **Christ** is central, ensuring that even the rise of antichristian powers serves God’s ultimate purposes.
    - Frame sees the **Antichrist** as permitted by God to reveal the depth of human rebellion.
    - He stresses that Christ’s victory is assured, both now and at the consummation.
    - The church is called to faithfulness in the face of ongoing antichristian opposition.
    - "Christ’s lordship means that no enemy, not even the man of lawlessness, can thwart his plan." (Systematic Theology, p. 1086)

3. **Antichrist as a Recurring Pattern**
    - Frame interprets the **Antichrist** not only as a future individual but as a pattern of opposition throughout church history.
    - He draws on **1 John** and **2 Thessalonians** to show multiple fulfillments.
    - This view guards against both sensationalism and complacency.
    - The church must discern and resist antichristian influences in every age.
    - "There have been many antichrists, and the spirit of antichrist is always at work." (Systematic Theology, p. 1084)

4. **Scripture as the Final Authority**
    - Frame insists that all teaching about the Antichrist and man of lawlessness must be grounded in **Scripture**.
    - He warns against speculative or extra-biblical theories.
    - Careful exegesis and theological synthesis are necessary for sound doctrine.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are foundational for eschatological hope.
    - "We must not go beyond what Scripture teaches about the antichrist, lest we fall into error." (Systematic Theology, p. 1087)

5. **Pastoral and Ethical Implications**
    - Frame connects eschatological teaching to the church’s mission and ethical life.
    - The reality of antichristian opposition calls for vigilance and perseverance.
    - Believers are encouraged to hope in Christ’s ultimate triumph.
    - The doctrine serves to strengthen faith, not to promote fear or speculation.
    - "The doctrine of antichrist should lead us to greater faithfulness, not anxiety." (Systematic Theology, p. 1088)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s treatment of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by emphasizing a biblical-theological approach over speculative eschatology. His focus on **Christ’s lordship** and the recurring nature of antichristian opposition encourages the church to discern and resist such influences in every generation. Frame’s work continues to shape evangelical discussions on eschatology, grounding them in the authority of Scripture and the hope of Christ’s victory.
