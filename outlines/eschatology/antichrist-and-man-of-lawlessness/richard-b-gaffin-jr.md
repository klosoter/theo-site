# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. interprets the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** through a distinctly **redemptive-historical** and **Pauline** lens, situating these figures within the broader framework of **New Testament eschatology**. He emphasizes the significance of the **already/not yet** dynamic, highlighting the ongoing conflict between Christ and Satan throughout the **last days** and the climactic role of these adversarial figures.

- "The man of lawlessness is the eschatological antithesis to Christ, whose appearance marks the climax of opposition to the gospel before the parousia." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- "The Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology" (1978)
- "Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit" (1979)
- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation" (2006)
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1993)
- Contributions to "The Westminster Theological Journal" on Pauline eschatology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redemptive-Historical Eschatology**
    - Interprets the Antichrist and man of lawlessness within the unfolding drama of **redemptive history**.
    - Emphasizes the inaugurated nature of the **last days** since Christ’s resurrection.
    - Views these figures as climactic expressions of opposition to Christ in history.
    - Sees their manifestation as part of the final intensification of evil before Christ’s return.
    "The New Testament presents the entire inter-advental period as the time of eschatological conflict." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

2. **Pauline Centrality of the Resurrection**
    - Frames the defeat of the Antichrist in terms of Christ’s resurrection victory.
    - Argues that the resurrection inaugurates the age in which the man of lawlessness operates.
    - Connects the hope of final deliverance to the resurrection’s ongoing significance.
    - Sees the resurrection as the guarantee of the ultimate defeat of all anti-Christian powers.
    "The resurrection is not only the beginning of the end but also the assurance of the end’s outcome." (The Centrality of the Resurrection)

3. **Already/Not Yet Tension**
    - Stresses that the Antichrist principle is present throughout the church age, not just at the end.
    - Holds that the man of lawlessness is both a future figure and a present reality in anti-Christian movements.
    - Maintains that the church must be vigilant in every era, recognizing the ongoing presence of lawlessness.
    - Interprets 2 Thessalonians 2 as both a prophecy and a paradigm for the church’s experience.
    "The mystery of lawlessness is already at work, even as it awaits its final revelation." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Christological Focus**
    - Asserts that the Antichrist is defined in opposition to the person and work of **Christ**.
    - Emphasizes the centrality of union with Christ as the church’s protection against deception.
    - Argues that the man of lawlessness mimics and opposes Christ’s authority and mission.
    - Highlights the necessity of discernment rooted in Christ’s finished work.
    "The antithesis between Christ and the man of lawlessness is the axis of eschatological conflict." (Westminster Theological Journal)

5. **Ecclesiological Implications**
    - Warns that the church will face increasing deception and opposition as the end approaches.
    - Encourages perseverance and faithfulness in the face of anti-Christian forces.
    - Stresses the role of the **Holy Spirit** in equipping the church to withstand lawlessness.
    - Urges a posture of hope rooted in the certainty of Christ’s victory.
    "The church’s endurance is grounded in the Spirit’s application of Christ’s triumph over all adversaries." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed eschatology** by emphasizing the redemptive-historical context of the Antichrist and the man of lawlessness. His articulation of the **already/not yet** dynamic has influenced generations of pastors and scholars in interpreting New Testament eschatological passages. Gaffin’s Christ-centered approach and careful exegesis continue to inform discussions on the church’s posture toward end-times opposition and the assurance of Christ’s ultimate victory.
