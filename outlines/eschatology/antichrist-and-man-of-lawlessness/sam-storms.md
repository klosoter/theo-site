# Sam Storms (1951– )

Sam Storms approaches the topic of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** from a broadly **Reformed** and **amillennial** perspective, emphasizing the symbolic and ongoing nature of these figures within **redemptive history**. He interprets the biblical texts as pointing to both a present reality of lawlessness and a future, climactic manifestation of evil opposed to **Christ’s lordship**. Storms situates the Antichrist within the broader context of **spiritual warfare** and the church’s perseverance.

- "The spirit of the antichrist is already at work, but it will one day culminate in a final, personal embodiment of evil." (Kingdom Come)

    - Connects the man of lawlessness with the final rebellion before Christ’s return.

## Legacy and Impact

Sam Storms has provided a robust **amillennial** alternative to popular dispensational views of the Antichrist, helping many evangelicals reconsider the biblical data in its redemptive-historical context. His work has influenced both pastors and laypeople to approach the topic with theological depth and pastoral sensitivity. By emphasizing the ongoing reality of spiritual opposition and the centrality of **Christ’s victory**, Storms has contributed to a more balanced and biblically grounded understanding of the Antichrist and the man of lawlessness.
