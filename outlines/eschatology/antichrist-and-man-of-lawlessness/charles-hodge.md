# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge approached the question of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** from a classic **Reformed** and **historicist** perspective, interpreting these figures primarily in relation to the development of the **papacy** within church history. He emphasized the continuity of **biblical prophecy** and its fulfillment in the unfolding of ecclesiastical events, particularly within the context of **2 Thessalonians 2** and the **Book of Revelation**. Hodge maintained that the Antichrist is not a single future individual, but rather a system of opposition to Christ manifest in the church's history.

- "The Antichrist is not a person, but a power; not an individual, but a dynasty." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (especially sections on eschatology)
- Commentary on the First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans (relevant for apocalyptic themes)
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on prophecy and the church)
- The Way of Life (for Hodge’s general eschatological framework)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antichrist as Ecclesiastical Power**
   - Identifies the **Antichrist** with the rise and development of the **papacy**.
   - Argues that the Antichrist is a system or office, not a single individual.
   - Sees the papal office as fulfilling the characteristics described in **2 Thessalonians 2**.
   - Emphasizes the historical continuity of this power throughout church history.
   - "The prophecy is not of an individual, but of an institution." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Biblical Prophecy Interpreted Historically**
   - Advocates a **historicist** reading of apocalyptic texts.
   - Connects the **man of lawlessness** with historical developments in the church.
   - Rejects purely futurist or preterist interpretations.
   - Stresses the unfolding of prophecy in the visible church over time.
   - "The predictions of Paul and John have been fulfilled in the history of the church." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Opposition to Christ as Central Mark**
   - Defines **Antichrist** by opposition to the person and work of **Christ**.
   - Highlights doctrinal corruption and usurpation of Christ’s mediatorial office.
   - Points to claims of infallibility and authority above Scripture as marks of Antichrist.
   - Warns against any system that undermines the sufficiency of Christ.
   - "Whatever sets itself in the place of Christ is, in so far, antichrist." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **The Man of Lawlessness as Apostasy**
   - Interprets the **man of lawlessness** as the embodiment of ecclesiastical apostasy.
   - Links this figure to the falling away described in the New Testament.
   - Argues that lawlessness is characterized by disregard for divine authority.
   - Sees this apostasy as both doctrinal and moral in nature.
   - "The apostasy is not from religion, but from the true religion." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Eschatological Hope in Christ’s Victory**
   - Affirms the ultimate destruction of the Antichrist by the coming of Christ.
   - Emphasizes the certainty of Christ’s triumph over all opposition.
   - Encourages perseverance and vigilance within the church.
   - Grounds eschatological hope in the promises of Scripture.
   - "The Lord shall consume that wicked one with the spirit of his mouth." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s identification of the **Antichrist** with the papacy became a standard position in nineteenth-century **Reformed theology**, shaping Presbyterian and evangelical eschatological thought. His historicist approach influenced generations of interpreters, especially within American Protestantism. While later scholarship has diversified, Hodge’s careful exegesis and commitment to the authority of **Scripture** remain influential in discussions of prophecy and the church’s future.
