# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards identify the **Antichrist** as a significant eschatological adversary, closely associating this figure with the **Papacy** in Rome. Drawing from biblical texts such as 2 Thessalonians 2 and Revelation, the Standards interpret the **man of sin** or **man of lawlessness** as a present reality within church history, rather than a purely future individual. This understanding is rooted in a **historicist** reading of prophecy and reflects the polemical context of the Reformation.

- "There is no other head of the Church but the Lord Jesus Christ: nor can the Pope of Rome, in any sense, be head thereof; but is that Antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalteth himself, in the Church, against Christ and all that is called God." (Westminster Confession of Faith 25.6)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially 25.6)
- Larger Catechism (Q&A 191)
- Shorter Catechism
- The Directory for Public Worship
- The Form of Presbyterial Church Government

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Identification of the Papacy as Antichrist**
    - The Standards explicitly name the Pope as the **Antichrist** and **man of sin**.
    - This identification is grounded in scriptural exegesis, especially 2 Thessalonians 2 and Revelation.
    - The Papacy is seen as usurping the unique headship of **Christ** over the Church.
    - The language reflects the Reformation's polemic against Roman Catholic ecclesiology.
    - "Nor can the Pope of Rome, in any sense, be head thereof; but is that Antichrist, that man of sin..." (WCF 25.6)

2. **Christ Alone as Head of the Church**
    - The Standards affirm the exclusive **mediatorship** and **headship** of Christ.
    - Any rival claimant to this role is viewed as fundamentally opposed to the gospel.
    - The Antichrist is defined by his opposition to Christ’s unique authority.
    - This commitment undergirds the rejection of papal supremacy.
    - "There is no other head of the Church but the Lord Jesus Christ..." (WCF 25.6)

3. **Historicist Eschatology**
    - The Standards interpret prophetic texts as unfolding throughout church history.
    - The **man of lawlessness** is not limited to a future individual but is present in ongoing ecclesiastical realities.
    - This view contrasts with futurist or preterist readings.
    - The identification of the Papacy as Antichrist is a hallmark of this approach.
    - "That Antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition..." (WCF 25.6)

4. **Scriptural Authority in Identifying Antichrist**
    - The Standards ground their identification in careful biblical exegesis.
    - Key texts include 2 Thessalonians 2, Daniel 7, and Revelation 13.
    - The use of Scripture is polemical but also confessional, shaping ecclesial identity.
    - The Antichrist is defined by scriptural marks: usurpation, blasphemy, and opposition to Christ.
    - "Exalteth himself, in the Church, against Christ and all that is called God." (WCF 25.6)

5. **Pastoral and Ecclesial Implications**
    - The doctrine serves to warn the Church against false teaching and corrupt authority.
    - It reinforces the necessity of **reformation** and **purity** in worship and governance.
    - The Antichrist motif shapes the Standards’ vision of church discipline and separation from Rome.
    - This teaching is intended to protect the flock from spiritual deception.
    - "That man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalteth himself, in the Church, against Christ..." (WCF 25.6)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards’ identification of the **Papacy as Antichrist** profoundly shaped Reformed confessional identity and polemics against Roman Catholicism. Their **historicist** approach influenced subsequent generations of Presbyterian and Reformed theologians, embedding this eschatological reading in confessional documents and ecclesial practice. While later Reformed traditions have nuanced or softened this stance, the Standards remain a touchstone for understanding classic Protestant views on the **man of lawlessness** and the enduring dangers of ecclesiastical corruption.
