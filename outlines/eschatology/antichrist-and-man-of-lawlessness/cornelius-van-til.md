# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the topic of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** through the lens of **redemptive history** and the **antithesis** between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan. He emphasized that these figures represent the climactic expression of **covenantal rebellion** and the outworking of **autonomous human reason** in opposition to God's revelation. For Van Til, the Antichrist is not merely an individual but a manifestation of the perennial conflict between **Christ-centered theism** and all forms of unbelief.

- "The Antichrist is the principle of autonomy come to its fullest expression in history." (Christianity and Barthianism)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antithesis as the Root of Antichrist**
    - The Antichrist embodies the ultimate opposition between the **covenant community** and the world.
    - This antithesis is not merely ethical but epistemological, rooted in presuppositions about reality.
    - The man of lawlessness is a historical and eschatological figure, but also a recurring principle.
    - All human attempts at autonomy participate in the spirit of Antichrist.
    - "The antithesis is the deepest principle of interpretation of history." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenantal Rebellion and Lawlessness**
    - The man of lawlessness is the archetype of covenant-breaking humanity.
    - Lawlessness is defined as rejection of God's authority and revelation.
    - The Antichrist is both a person and a system opposed to the Lordship of Christ.
    - The rebellion is not neutral but always religiously motivated.
    - "All men are either covenant keepers or covenant breakers." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Eschatological Fulfillment of Unbelief**
    - The Antichrist represents the consummation of unbelief in history.
    - The man of lawlessness is the final, visible opposition to Christ before His return.
    - This opposition is anticipated throughout redemptive history in various forms.
    - The eschatological conflict is the outworking of the antithesis on a cosmic scale.
    - "History moves inexorably toward the final manifestation of the principle of unbelief." (Christianity and Barthianism)

4. **Autonomous Reason as Antichristian Principle**
    - The root of Antichrist is the assertion of human autonomy over divine revelation.
    - All non-Christian philosophies are, in principle, antichristian.
    - The man of lawlessness is the personification of autonomous human thought.
    - True knowledge is possible only by submission to Christ’s Lordship.
    - "Autonomous man would dethrone God and enthrone himself." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Christ’s Victory over the Antichrist**
    - The Antichrist and man of lawlessness are ultimately defeated by Christ.
    - The victory is both accomplished (in Christ’s first coming) and anticipated (in His return).
    - The church is called to witness to Christ’s Lordship in the midst of antichristian opposition.
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in the certainty of Christ’s triumph.
    - "The victory of Christ is the presupposition of all Christian apologetics." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** has shaped Reformed apologetics by rooting eschatological opposition in the broader context of the **antithesis** and covenantal rebellion. His insistence on the epistemological and ethical dimensions of lawlessness has influenced generations of theologians to see eschatological figures as both historical and principial. Van Til’s legacy endures in the way Reformed theology frames the cosmic conflict between Christ and all forms of unbelief, emphasizing the necessity of presupposing Christ’s victory in all theological reflection.
