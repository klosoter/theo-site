# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—address the **Antichrist** and **man of lawlessness** within the broader context of **eschatology** and the church’s ongoing struggle against false teaching. These confessions identify the **Antichrist** as a spiritual and institutional reality opposed to **Christ’s lordship**, often associating it with corrupt ecclesiastical authority and doctrinal error. The documents emphasize the church’s call to discernment and perseverance amid the presence of **apostasy** and **deception** in the last days.

- "Therefore we reject all human inventions and laws introduced into the worship of God, which bind and force the conscience in any way." (Belgic Confession, Art. 32)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (esp. Articles 28–29, 32)
- Heidelberg Catechism (esp. Q&A 54, 123)
- Canons of Dort (esp. Rejection of Errors, Fifth Head)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical and Reformed Creeds and Confessions)
- The Reformation Study Bible (notes on confessional eschatology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antichrist as Ecclesiastical Corruption**
    - The confessions identify the **Antichrist** with those who usurp Christ’s authority in the church.
    - Corrupt church leadership that imposes human traditions is seen as antichristian.
    - The **Roman papacy** is historically referenced as embodying antichristian characteristics.
    - The true church is marked by faithfulness to **Scripture** and rejection of false authority.
    - "We believe that we ought diligently and circumspectly to discern from the Word of God what is the true church." (Belgic Confession, Art. 29)

2. **Man of Lawlessness as Eschatological Reality**
    - The confessions affirm the future manifestation of the **man of lawlessness** as foretold in Scripture.
    - This figure represents ultimate rebellion against God and the exaltation of self above divine law.
    - The church is called to vigilance, recognizing ongoing threats of apostasy.
    - The final revelation of the man of lawlessness is linked to the return of Christ.
    - "We expect that great day with longing, to the end that we may fully enjoy the promises of God in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

3. **Sufficiency and Authority of Scripture**
    - The confessions uphold **Scripture** as the only rule for faith and practice.
    - Any teaching or authority contrary to Scripture is antichristian in nature.
    - The church must reject all human inventions in worship and doctrine.
    - The **Word of God** is the standard for discerning truth from error.
    - "We believe that those holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

4. **Perseverance of the Saints Amid Apostasy**
    - The confessions stress the perseverance of the elect despite the presence of false teaching.
    - The church will endure tribulation and deception until Christ’s return.
    - Believers are exhorted to remain steadfast in the face of antichristian opposition.
    - Assurance is grounded in God’s sovereign grace, not in human institutions.
    - "God, who is rich in mercy, according to His unchangeable purpose of election, does not wholly withdraw the Holy Spirit from His own people." (Canons of Dort, V.6)

5. **Eschatological Hope and Final Judgment**
    - The confessions affirm the **second coming of Christ** and the final defeat of all antichristian powers.
    - The church’s hope is oriented toward the consummation of God’s kingdom.
    - The final judgment will expose and destroy the man of lawlessness and all falsehood.
    - Believers are called to live in expectation of Christ’s victorious return.
    - "We believe, according to the Word of God, that when the time appointed by the Lord is come... our Lord Jesus Christ will come from heaven, corporally and visibly, as He ascended." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed understandings of the **Antichrist** and **man of lawlessness**, emphasizing the dangers of ecclesiastical corruption and the necessity of scriptural fidelity. Their teaching has influenced subsequent confessional documents and continues to inform Reformed churches’ vigilance against doctrinal error and apostasy. By rooting eschatological hope in Christ’s return and the final judgment, these confessions provide a framework for discerning the marks of the true church and resisting antichristian influences throughout history.
