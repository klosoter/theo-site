# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached the question of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** with a strong commitment to the authority of **Scripture** and the **Reformed doctrine of eschatology**. He interpreted these figures primarily within the context of **Pauline** and **Johannine** writings, emphasizing their role in the unfolding of **redemptive history** and the ultimate triumph of **Christ's kingdom**.

- "The Antichrist is not so much a person as a principle, and that principle is lawlessness." (Biblical Doctrines)

## Key Works

- "The Apocalypse" in The Expositor (1888)
- Biblical Doctrines (1929)
- "The Millennium and the Apocalypse" in Biblical and Theological Studies (1912)
- "Antichrist" in International Standard Bible Encyclopedia
- Selected Shorter Writings, Vol. 2

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture Interprets Scripture**
    - Warfield insists that **biblical prophecy** must be understood in light of the whole canon.
    - He reads the **Antichrist** and **man of lawlessness** passages in relation to both Old and New Testament texts.
    - Emphasizes the unity of **Pauline** and **Johannine** perspectives.
    - Rejects speculative readings not grounded in the text.
    - "The New Testament itself gives us the key to the interpretation of its own prophecies." (Biblical Doctrines)

2. **Antichrist as Principle, Not Merely Person**
    - Warfield sees the **Antichrist** as representing a principle of **lawlessness** and opposition to Christ.
    - He acknowledges historical manifestations but stresses the ongoing spiritual reality.
    - The **man of lawlessness** is a climactic expression of this principle.
    - Warns against narrow identifications with single historical figures.
    - "The Antichrist is not so much an individual as a movement or tendency." (ISBE, "Antichrist")

3. **Eschatology is Christocentric**
    - Warfield centers all eschatological expectation on the **person and work of Christ**.
    - The defeat of the **Antichrist** is assured by Christ’s return.
    - The focus is on the victory of **God’s kingdom** rather than sensationalism.
    - He critiques millenarian schemes that distract from Christ’s centrality.
    - "The whole drift of prophecy is toward the triumph of Christ, not the reign of Antichrist." (Biblical Doctrines)

4. **Historical Continuity in Redemptive History**
    - Warfield interprets the **Antichrist** motif as recurring throughout church history.
    - He sees the principle of **lawlessness** at work in various ages and institutions.
    - The final manifestation is the culmination, not the only instance.
    - This view guards against both historicist and futurist excesses.
    - "The spirit of Antichrist has been operative from the beginning." (Selected Shorter Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Rejection of Speculative Eschatology**
    - Warfield opposes sensationalist or newspaper exegesis of prophecy.
    - He urges careful, sober interpretation rooted in **Reformed theology**.
    - Warns against identifying the **Antichrist** with contemporary political figures.
    - Emphasizes the sufficiency of **Scripture** for understanding the end times.
    - "We must beware of reading our own times too readily into the prophetic word." (The Millennium and the Apocalypse)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s careful, **Reformed** approach to the **Antichrist** and **man of lawlessness** has shaped subsequent evangelical and Presbyterian eschatology. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the centrality of **Christ** in interpreting prophecy remains influential. Warfield’s legacy is seen in the caution he brought to eschatological speculation and his emphasis on the enduring relevance of biblical principles over sensationalist readings. His work continues to inform responsible theological engagement with apocalyptic texts.
