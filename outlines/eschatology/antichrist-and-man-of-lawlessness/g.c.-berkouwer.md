# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the topic of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** with a focus on the dynamic and existential dimensions of **evil** within **redemptive history**. He emphasized the **eschatological tension** between the already and the not-yet, interpreting the Antichrist not merely as a future individual but as a recurring reality that opposes **Christ** and the **church** throughout history. Berkouwer’s analysis is marked by caution against speculative identification and a call to discern the spiritual reality of lawlessness in the present age.

- "The Antichrist is not a puzzle to be solved, but a reality to be discerned in the light of the gospel." (The Return of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Return of Christ (De wederkomst van Christus)
- The Conflict with Idolatry (in Studies in Dogmatics series)
- The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth (contextual discussion)
- Holy Scripture (for hermeneutical approach)
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Perseverance

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antichrist as Eschatological Principle**
    - The Antichrist is not limited to a single historical figure but represents a recurring opposition to **Christ**.
    - This principle is manifest in various forms throughout **church history**.
    - The New Testament presents the Antichrist as both a present and future reality.
    - The church is called to discern the spirit of Antichrist in every age.
    - "The New Testament does not permit us to localize the Antichrist exclusively in the future." (The Return of Christ)

2. **Man of Lawlessness and Mystery of Iniquity**
    - The **man of lawlessness** embodies the mystery of iniquity already at work in the world.
    - Berkouwer interprets this figure as both a personal and supra-personal reality.
    - The restraint of lawlessness is a sign of God’s sovereign control over history.
    - The final revelation of the man of lawlessness will be climactic but not disconnected from ongoing evil.
    - "The mystery of lawlessness is not only a future event but a present reality." (The Return of Christ)

3. **Caution Against Speculation**
    - Berkouwer warns against identifying the Antichrist with specific historical persons or institutions.
    - He stresses the dangers of speculative eschatology that distracts from the gospel.
    - The focus should remain on the **redemptive work of Christ** rather than sensational predictions.
    - The Antichrist motif serves as a call to vigilance and faithfulness.
    - "Scripture does not satisfy our curiosity but calls us to discernment and watchfulness." (The Return of Christ)

4. **Eschatological Tension: Already and Not Yet**
    - The Antichrist is both a present and future reality within the **eschatological tension**.
    - The church lives in the overlap of the ages, experiencing both victory and conflict.
    - The presence of lawlessness is a sign of the ongoing spiritual battle.
    - Final victory belongs to Christ, but the church must persevere amid opposition.
    - "The tension between the already and the not yet shapes our understanding of Antichrist." (The Return of Christ)

5. **Christocentric Discernment**
    - All discussion of Antichrist and lawlessness must be grounded in the person and work of **Christ**.
    - The ultimate hope is not in identifying evil but in the certainty of Christ’s return.
    - The church’s calling is to witness to Christ amid the reality of opposition.
    - Discernment is exercised through faith in the gospel, not fear of the future.
    - "The victory over the Antichrist is assured in the triumph of Christ." (The Return of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced approach to the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** has shaped Reformed eschatological thought by emphasizing the existential and redemptive-historical dimensions of these doctrines. His caution against speculative identification and his focus on the **already/not yet** tension have provided a corrective to sensationalist readings. Berkouwer’s Christocentric and pastoral orientation continues to influence contemporary theology, encouraging the church to discern evil in light of the gospel and to persevere in hope.
