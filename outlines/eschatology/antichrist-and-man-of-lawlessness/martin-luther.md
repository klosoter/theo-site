# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther identified the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** primarily with the office of the **papacy**, interpreting these biblical figures through the lens of ecclesiastical corruption and doctrinal error. He argued that the **Roman Catholic Church**, by opposing the true **gospel** and exalting human tradition over **Scripture**, fulfilled the prophetic warnings found in **2 Thessalonians 2** and the **apocalyptic literature** of the New Testament.

- "I am persuaded that if St. Paul were to come back and see how the pope rules, he would say, 'You are the man of sin, the son of perdition.'" (Lectures on 2 Thessalonians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on 2 Thessalonians
- Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope (1537)
- Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- Smalcald Articles (1537)
- Commentary on Daniel

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Identification of the Papacy as Antichrist**
    - The papal office is seen as the fulfillment of biblical prophecies concerning the **Antichrist**.
    - Luther argued that the pope exalts himself above God by claiming ultimate spiritual authority.
    - The papacy's opposition to the **gospel** and **justification by faith** is central to this identification.
    - He viewed the papal system as a manifestation of the **man of lawlessness** described by Paul.
    - "The pope is the very Antichrist who has exalted himself above, and opposed himself against Christ." (Smalcald Articles)

2. **Scripture as the Criterion for Identifying Antichrist**
    - Luther insisted that **Scripture alone** must define and expose the Antichrist.
    - He interpreted prophetic texts (especially 2 Thessalonians 2 and Revelation) as referring to contemporary ecclesiastical realities.
    - The Antichrist is recognized by his opposition to the clear teaching of **Scripture**.
    - Any authority that contradicts the gospel is to be judged by the Word of God.
    - "Whatever does not teach Christ is assuredly of Antichrist." (Lectures on 2 Thessalonians)

3. **Corruption of Doctrine as a Mark of Antichrist**
    - The Antichrist is characterized by the distortion of **justification by faith** and the sacraments.
    - Luther saw the papacy's teachings on works, indulgences, and mediation as corruptions.
    - The denial of the sufficiency of Christ's work is a key sign of the Antichrist.
    - False doctrine is not merely error but a fulfillment of prophetic warning.
    - "Wherever the gospel is opposed, there is the Antichrist." (Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope)

4. **Antichrist as an Ecclesiastical, Not Merely Political, Power**
    - Luther emphasized that the Antichrist arises within the visible church, not from secular government.
    - The Antichrist's power is spiritual, exercised through false teaching and ecclesiastical authority.
    - This view contrasts with earlier interpretations that focused on political rulers.
    - The Antichrist's deception is most dangerous because it appears under the guise of Christianity.
    - "The Antichrist sits in the temple of God, showing himself as God." (Lectures on 2 Thessalonians)

5. **Eschatological Urgency and Pastoral Warning**
    - Luther believed the presence of the Antichrist signaled the nearness of the **last days**.
    - He urged vigilance and discernment among Christians to resist deception.
    - The doctrine served as a pastoral warning against trusting in human authority over Christ.
    - Luther called for reformation and a return to the pure gospel as the antidote to Antichrist.
    - "Let us beware, for the devil is never more dangerous than when he comes in the name of Christ." (Commentary on Daniel)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s identification of the **papacy as Antichrist** became a defining feature of Protestant polemics and shaped the eschatological outlook of the Reformation. His interpretation influenced confessional documents and set a precedent for reading apocalyptic texts in light of ecclesiastical developments. While later Protestantism nuanced or moderated this stance, Luther’s bold application of **biblical prophecy** to contemporary church structures remains a significant contribution to Reformation theology and the doctrine of the **Antichrist**.
