# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the topic of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** within the broader framework of **Revelation**, **sin**, and the **eschatological conflict** between God and rebellious humanity. He emphasized the existential and personal dimensions of evil, interpreting the Antichrist not merely as a future individual but as a manifestation of **radical opposition to God** within history and human structures. Brunner’s theology resists speculative detail, focusing instead on the **ethical and spiritual reality** of lawlessness as it opposes the revelation of Christ.

- "The Antichrist is not merely a figure of the end, but the perennial possibility of man’s revolt against God." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Man in Revolt
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antichrist as Existential Reality**
   - The Antichrist represents the ongoing human tendency to reject God’s sovereignty.
   - Brunner interprets the figure as both a symbol and a real possibility within history.
   - He connects the Antichrist to the existential condition of **sin** and alienation from God.
   - The focus is on the spiritual and ethical dimension rather than apocalyptic speculation.
   - "The Antichrist is the spirit of self-deification, the refusal to accept the limits set by God." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Man of Lawlessness as Rebellion**
   - The "man of lawlessness" is seen as the embodiment of humanity’s revolt against divine order.
   - Brunner links lawlessness to the refusal of **revelation** and the assertion of autonomous reason.
   - This rebellion is not only future but present in every age.
   - The phenomenon is both personal and collective, manifesting in culture and institutions.
   - "Lawlessness is the assertion of man’s own will against the will of God." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

3. **Eschatological Conflict**
   - Brunner frames the Antichrist within the cosmic struggle between Christ and the forces of evil.
   - The conflict is not merely future but is realized in the present through the opposition to Christ.
   - The ultimate victory belongs to Christ, but the struggle is real and ongoing.
   - The church is called to discern and resist the spirit of Antichrist in every generation.
   - "The eschatological battle is fought wherever the truth of Christ is denied." (Truth as Encounter)

4. **Revelation versus Lawlessness**
   - True knowledge of God comes only through **revelation**, not autonomous human effort.
   - Lawlessness is the rejection of this revelation and the attempt to construct meaning apart from God.
   - Brunner stresses the necessity of divine initiative for salvation and truth.
   - The Antichrist is the ultimate expression of the rejection of revelation.
   - "Where revelation is denied, the spirit of Antichrist reigns." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Ethical and Spiritual Vigilance**
   - The church must remain vigilant against manifestations of lawlessness in doctrine and life.
   - Brunner warns against both secular and religious forms of self-assertion.
   - The Antichrist is not only an external enemy but a temptation within the church itself.
   - Ethical responsibility is grounded in continual openness to God’s revelation in Christ.
   - "The danger of Antichrist is always present where the church ceases to listen to the Word." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s interpretation of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** influenced 20th-century Protestant thought by shifting the focus from speculative eschatology to the existential and ethical dimensions of evil. His emphasis on **revelation** and the ongoing reality of lawlessness challenged the church to discern spiritual opposition in every age. Brunner’s work remains significant for those exploring the intersection of **sin**, **eschatology**, and the church’s witness in a secular world.
