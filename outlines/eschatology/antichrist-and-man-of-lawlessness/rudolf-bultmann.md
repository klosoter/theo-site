# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the concepts of **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** through his program of **demythologization**, interpreting these apocalyptic figures not as literal eschatological opponents but as mythic symbols expressing existential realities. For Bultmann, such New Testament motifs reflect the human condition under **sin** and **unbelief**, rather than predictions of specific historical individuals. His existential interpretation reframes these figures as representations of humanity’s alienation from God.

- "The apocalyptic myth is only the wrapping in which the kerygma is set." (Kerygma and Myth)

## Key Works

- "Kerygma and Myth" (1941, essays and responses)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Apocalyptic Imagery**
    - Interprets **Antichrist** and **man of lawlessness** as mythic symbols, not literal future figures.
    - Sees apocalyptic language as expressing existential truths about human estrangement from God.
    - Argues that mythological elements must be translated into existential categories to be meaningful today.
    - Maintains that the New Testament’s mythic worldview is culturally conditioned.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Evil**
    - Views the **man of lawlessness** as a symbol of humanity’s rebellion and autonomy apart from God.
    - Evil is not personified in a single eschatological figure but is a universal existential reality.
    - The Antichrist motif points to the human tendency to absolutize the self and reject divine authority.
    - Emphasizes the inwardness of sin and alienation rather than external apocalyptic events.
    - "The real enemy is not a future tyrant but the self-assertion of man against God." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Kerygmatic Priority over Apocalyptic Detail**
    - The core of Christian proclamation (**kerygma**) is not dependent on apocalyptic predictions.
    - Apocalyptic motifs serve to highlight the urgency of decision in the present, not to map future history.
    - The message of Christ confronts each person existentially, calling for authentic faith.
    - The Antichrist and man of lawlessness are secondary to the existential encounter with the gospel.
    - "What matters is not the apocalyptic expectation but the call to decision here and now." (Kerygma and Myth)

4. **Historical Skepticism toward Eschatological Figures**
    - Doubts the historical or predictive value of New Testament references to Antichrist.
    - Regards such figures as products of early Christian myth-making, not prophecy.
    - Focuses on the existential meaning behind the myth rather than its historical fulfillment.
    - Encourages critical engagement with the biblical text, separating myth from message.
    - "We cannot accept the mythical eschatology as true; we must ask what it means." (New Testament and Mythology)

5. **Christ as the Eschatological Event**
    - Christ’s coming is the decisive eschatological event, rendering other apocalyptic figures secondary.
    - The Antichrist motif is subsumed under the existential crisis brought by the encounter with Christ.
    - The New Testament’s focus is on the new existence made possible in Christ, not on future adversaries.
    - The defeat of evil is realized in the proclamation and acceptance of the gospel.
    - "The eschatological event is not future catastrophe but the presence of Christ in the word." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential and **demythologizing** approach profoundly shaped twentieth-century New Testament scholarship, especially in the interpretation of apocalyptic texts. His reframing of the Antichrist and man of lawlessness as existential symbols rather than literal eschatological opponents challenged traditional readings and influenced later theological reflection on **evil** and **eschatology**. While controversial, his work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between myth, history, and faith in modern theology.
