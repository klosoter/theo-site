# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, addressed the identity and nature of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** within the framework of **biblical prophecy** and **systematic theology**. He identified the Antichrist as a specific eschatological figure, closely associating him with the **Papacy**, and interpreted the **man of sin** in 2 Thessalonians 2 as a reference to this same office. Turretin’s approach is marked by careful exegesis and a commitment to the **historic Protestant polemic** against Rome.

- "We prove that the Antichrist is the Roman pontiff, not as an individual, but as a series of men occupying the same throne." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 3.12.7)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 3, Topics 12–13)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Commentarius in Epistolam ad Thessalonicenses (Commentary on Thessalonians)
- Selected passages in Reformation polemical works (as cited in secondary literature)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antichrist as a Historical and Ecclesiastical Figure**
    - The Antichrist is not merely a future individual but a succession of leaders.
    - The office of the **Papacy** fulfills the biblical marks of Antichrist.
    - The Antichrist arises within the visible church, not from secular powers.
    - This identification is grounded in both **prophetic texts** and church history.
    - "The seat of Antichrist is not in the Turkish empire, but in the temple of God, that is, in the Christian church." (Institutes, 3.12.6)

2. **Man of Lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians 2**
    - The "man of sin" is equated with the Antichrist.
    - Paul’s description is interpreted as a prophecy of the Papal system.
    - The characteristics—opposition, self-exaltation, deception—fit the Papacy.
    - The restraining power ("katechon") is identified with the Roman Empire.
    - "Paul describes the Antichrist as sitting in the temple of God, showing himself as God, which agrees with the Pope." (Institutes, 3.12.8)

3. **Antichrist’s Deceptive Religious Authority**
    - The Antichrist claims divine prerogatives and spiritual authority.
    - He corrupts doctrine and introduces **idolatry** and **false worship**.
    - The Antichrist’s power is exercised under the guise of Christianity.
    - Signs and wonders are used to deceive the faithful.
    - "He will not be an open enemy, but a secret adversary under the mask of a friend." (Institutes, 3.12.9)

4. **Continuity with Reformed Confessional Tradition**
    - Turretin aligns with the **Westminster Confession** and other Reformed standards.
    - He draws on the consensus of **Reformers** like Calvin and Beza.
    - The identification of Antichrist is a mark of Protestant orthodoxy.
    - Scriptural interpretation is guided by confessional commitments.
    - "The Reformed churches with one voice have declared the Pope to be the Antichrist." (Institutes, 3.12.10)

5. **Eschatological and Pastoral Implications**
    - The doctrine serves to warn the church against apostasy and deception.
    - It calls believers to discernment and faithfulness to **Scripture**.
    - The final defeat of Antichrist is assured by Christ’s return.
    - The teaching is intended to comfort and strengthen the faithful.
    - "The Lord will consume him with the breath of his mouth and destroy him with the brightness of his coming." (Institutes, 3.12.11)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s robust articulation of the **Antichrist** doctrine shaped subsequent **Reformed polemics** and confessional identity, especially in opposition to Roman Catholic claims. His careful exegesis and systematic approach provided a model for later theologians addressing eschatological prophecy. Though modern scholarship often nuances or departs from his identification of the Papacy, Turretin’s influence endures in discussions of **Antichrist** within confessional Reformed circles.
