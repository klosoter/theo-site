# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin interpreted the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** as corporate, historical realities, chiefly identifying them with the **papacy**. He grounded this view in a close reading of **Scripture** and the **Reformed doctrine of Christ’s kingship**, emphasizing the corruption and usurpation of Christ’s unique mediatorial office as central marks of Antichrist.

- "I deny that it is one man who is meant by Antichrist; for Paul speaks not of one, but of many." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, IV.7.24)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book IV)
- Commentary on 2 Thessalonians
- Commentary on 1 John
- Treatises Against the Anabaptists and Against the Libertines
- Selected Letters (relevant correspondence on the papacy and eschatology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antichrist as a Corporate Reality**
    - Calvin rejects the notion of a single, future individual as Antichrist.
    - He identifies the office of the **papacy** as the ongoing manifestation of Antichrist.
    - The Antichrist is defined by opposition to **Christ’s rule** and gospel.
    - This view is rooted in a historical reading of **2 Thessalonians 2** and **1 John**.
    "Paul, however, does not speak of one individual, but of a kingdom which was to be taken possession of by Satan." (Commentary on 2 Thessalonians 2:3)

2. **Man of Lawlessness as Papal Office**
    - The “man of lawlessness” is equated with the papal system, not a single eschatological figure.
    - Calvin sees the papacy as exalting itself above God and usurping **Christ’s authority**.
    - The lawlessness is doctrinal and practical, seen in the distortion of gospel truth.
    - This interpretation is polemically directed against **Roman Catholic** claims.
    "He calls it the apostasy, by which the Church was to be greatly corrupted." (Commentary on 2 Thessalonians 2:3)

3. **Scriptural Authority in Identifying Antichrist**
    - Calvin insists that **Scripture alone** defines the marks of Antichrist.
    - He appeals to **2 Thessalonians**, **Daniel**, and **1 John** for criteria.
    - The Antichrist is recognized by opposition to **Christ’s person and work**.
    - Human tradition or speculation must be rejected in favor of biblical testimony.
    "Let us, therefore, hold it as indubitable that the Roman Pontiff is the very Antichrist." (Institutes IV.7.28)

4. **Christ’s Kingship and the Usurpation of His Office**
    - The Antichrist is characterized by claiming **Christ’s prerogatives**.
    - Calvin highlights the papacy’s claim to mediate grace and rule the church.
    - The denial of **Christ’s sole headship** is central to Calvin’s critique.
    - This is linked to the Reformed doctrine of **Christ alone as Mediator**.
    "He robs God of his honor in order to transfer it to himself." (Institutes IV.7.25)

5. **Eschatological Sobriety and Rejection of Speculation**
    - Calvin warns against excessive curiosity about the end times.
    - He urges believers to focus on the present reality of Antichrist’s work.
    - The church must remain vigilant against **doctrinal corruption**.
    - Eschatology should serve to strengthen faith and obedience, not speculation.
    "It is not our duty to be so curious as to be led away from the right path by vain speculations." (Commentary on 2 Thessalonians 2:3)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s identification of the **papacy as Antichrist** became a defining feature of Reformed polemics and shaped Protestant eschatological thought for centuries. His insistence on **Scriptural authority** and the corporate, historical nature of Antichrist influenced later confessional documents and commentaries. While modern Reformed theologians may nuance or depart from his specific identification, Calvin’s approach to the **man of lawlessness** remains a significant reference point in discussions of **ecclesiology** and **eschatology**.
