# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema approached the topic of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** from a Reformed, amillennial perspective, emphasizing their roles within the broader context of **redemptive history** and **eschatology**. He argued that the Antichrist is not merely a future individual but represents a recurring principle of opposition to **Christ** and his church, culminating in a final, intensified manifestation before the **parousia**.

- "The Antichrist is both a present reality and a future expectation." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Key Works

- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- "Amillennialism" in The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views (1977)
- What About the Antichrist? (pamphlet, 1979)
- The Four Major Cults (1963) [contextual discussion]
- Created in God's Image (1986) [background on human rebellion]

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antichrist as a Principle and Person**
    - The Antichrist is both an ongoing spiritual reality and a final eschatological figure.
    - He embodies opposition to **Christ** and the **church** throughout history.
    - The "man of lawlessness" in 2 Thessalonians 2 is the climactic expression of this principle.
    - The Antichrist’s activity intensifies as history progresses toward the end.
    - "The Antichrist is not just one person, but a principle that finds its culmination in a final individual." ("The Bible and the Future")

2. **Amillennial Eschatology**
    - Rejects a literal, earthly millennium; sees the millennium as the present church age.
    - The Antichrist’s activity is present throughout this age, not confined to a future tribulation.
    - The final manifestation of the Antichrist precedes the **second coming**.
    - Emphasizes the already/not yet tension of **kingdom** realities.
    - "The millennium is the period between Christ’s first and second comings, during which the Antichrist principle is at work." ("The Bible and the Future")

3. **Biblical-Theological Approach**
    - Interprets Antichrist texts in light of the whole **canon of Scripture**.
    - Connects the "man of lawlessness" with other biblical images of opposition (e.g., Daniel’s little horn, Revelation’s beast).
    - Stresses the unity of biblical prophecy regarding the end times.
    - Avoids speculative identifications of the Antichrist with contemporary figures.
    - "Scripture presents the Antichrist as a recurring reality, culminating in a final, personal manifestation." ("The Bible and the Future")

4. **Christocentric Focus**
    - The Antichrist is defined by his opposition to the person and work of **Christ**.
    - The ultimate victory belongs to Christ, who will destroy the Antichrist at his coming.
    - The church’s hope is rooted in Christ’s triumph, not in identifying the Antichrist.
    - The Antichrist’s deception is a counterfeit of Christ’s authority and power.
    - "The Antichrist is the supreme opponent of Christ, but his defeat is certain." ("The Bible and the Future")

5. **Pastoral and Practical Implications**
    - Warns the church against false teaching and apostasy as manifestations of the Antichrist spirit.
    - Encourages vigilance and faithfulness in the face of opposition.
    - Reassures believers of Christ’s ultimate victory and the security of the elect.
    - Calls for discernment rather than fear or speculation.
    - "Believers must be alert to the spirit of Antichrist in every age, trusting in Christ’s promised victory." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s interpretation of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** has shaped Reformed and evangelical eschatology, especially among amillennialists. His emphasis on the Antichrist as both a principle and a person provided a balanced alternative to sensationalist or purely futurist readings. Hoekema’s biblical-theological method and Christ-centered focus continue to influence discussions on **last things** and the church’s posture toward eschatological evil. His work remains a standard reference for those seeking a sober, scripturally grounded understanding of the Antichrist motif.
