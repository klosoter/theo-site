# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale approaches the topic of the **Antichrist** and the **man of lawlessness** through a robustly **biblical-theological** and **redemptive-historical** lens, emphasizing the continuity between Old and New Testament expectations. He interprets these figures as both historical and typological realities, rooted in **apocalyptic literature** and culminating in the eschatological opposition to Christ and his church. Beale stresses the importance of **symbolism** and **intertextuality** in understanding these end-time adversaries.

- "The Antichrist figure is best understood as the climactic embodiment of opposition to God, anticipated in Old Testament prophecy and fulfilled in various ways throughout church history, ultimately culminating at the end of the age." ("The Book of Revelation," NIGTC)

## Key Works

- "The Book of Revelation" (New International Greek Testament Commentary, 1999)
- "1–2 Thessalonians" (IVP New Testament Commentary, 2003)
- "A New Testament Biblical Theology" (2011)
- "The Temple and the Church’s Mission" (2004)
- "Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament" (co-edited with D.A. Carson, 2007)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typological Fulfillment of Antichrist**
   - Sees the **Antichrist** as a recurring type throughout redemptive history, not limited to a single individual.
   - Emphasizes the Old Testament background, especially **Daniel 7–12** and **Ezekiel 28**.
   - Argues that New Testament references (e.g., 2 Thessalonians 2, Revelation 13) build on these typologies.
   - Maintains that the Antichrist is both a present reality and a future eschatological figure.
   - "The Antichrist is a composite figure, drawing together strands from Old Testament prophecy and New Testament fulfillment." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology")

2. **Symbolic and Apocalyptic Interpretation**
   - Interprets apocalyptic texts (especially Revelation) as employing **symbolic language** to describe the Antichrist and man of lawlessness.
   - Warns against overly literal readings that miss the theological import of the imagery.
   - Highlights the use of **Old Testament allusions** to shape the portrait of eschatological evil.
   - Connects the **beast** of Revelation with the man of lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians 2.
   - "John’s use of beast imagery is rooted in Daniel and Ezekiel, pointing to a trans-historical reality of opposition to God." ("The Book of Revelation")

3. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
   - Stresses that the Antichrist principle is operative throughout the church age, not just at the end.
   - The **man of lawlessness** is both a present force and a future climactic opponent.
   - The church continually faces manifestations of antichrist opposition until Christ’s return.
   - The final revelation of the man of lawlessness will intensify existing patterns of rebellion.
   - "Paul’s teaching in 2 Thessalonians 2 reflects an already/not yet tension regarding the man of lawlessness." ("1–2 Thessalonians")

4. **Temple Motif and Divine Presence**
   - Links the Antichrist’s activity to the **temple motif**, both as a symbol of God’s presence and as the locus of blasphemous opposition.
   - Argues that the man of lawlessness “taking his seat in the temple” is best understood symbolically, referring to the church as God’s temple.
   - Sees the Antichrist’s self-exaltation as a counterfeit of Christ’s true lordship.
   - Emphasizes the church’s role as the eschatological temple under threat from false worship.
   - "The temple in 2 Thessalonians 2 is most plausibly the church, the locus of God’s presence now under attack." ("The Temple and the Church’s Mission")

5. **Redemptive-Historical Continuity**
   - Views the Antichrist theme as part of the broader **redemptive-historical narrative**.
   - Traces the motif from Genesis (the serpent) through the prophets to its New Testament climax.
   - Emphasizes the sovereignty of God over all manifestations of evil, including the Antichrist.
   - The defeat of the man of lawlessness is assured by Christ’s **parousia** and final judgment.
   - "The defeat of the Antichrist is the final demonstration of Christ’s victory in redemptive history." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed eschatology**, especially in the interpretation of apocalyptic texts and the figure of the Antichrist. His emphasis on **biblical theology** and intertextual connections has encouraged a more nuanced, redemptive-historical reading of the man of lawlessness. Beale’s scholarship continues to influence pastors, scholars, and students seeking to understand the continuity between Old and New Testament eschatological expectations. His approach has become a standard reference point in discussions of **symbolism** and **typology** in eschatology.
