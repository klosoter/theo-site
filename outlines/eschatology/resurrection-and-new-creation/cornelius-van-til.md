# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til interpreted the doctrines of **resurrection** and **new creation** through the lens of **Reformed apologetics** and **redemptive history**. He maintained that the resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event in **God’s covenantal plan**, inaugurating the **eschatological new creation** and grounding the believer’s hope in the consummation of all things. For Van Til, these doctrines are inseparable from the **presuppositional** affirmation of the triune God’s sovereign purpose in history.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the central fact of history, the guarantee of the new creation that God has promised." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Redemptive-Historical Fulfillment**
    - The resurrection is the climactic act in **God’s redemptive history**.
    - It fulfills the promises of the **Old Testament** regarding restoration and life.
    - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the **new creation** and the age to come.
    - The event is integrally connected to the entire **covenantal narrative**.
    "The resurrection is not a mere miracle among others, but the fulfillment of the whole redemptive process." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenantal Significance of the New Creation**
    - The new creation is the realization of God’s **covenant purposes** in Christ.
    - It is both a present reality and a future consummation for believers.
    - The resurrection is the firstfruits, guaranteeing the renewal of all things.
    - The church participates in the new creation through union with the risen Christ.
    "The covenant God brings his people into the new creation through the resurrection of his Son." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Presuppositional Necessity of Resurrection**
    - The resurrection is foundational to a **Christian worldview**.
    - Without it, there is no coherent basis for meaning, ethics, or hope.
    - Apologetics must presuppose the truth of Christ’s resurrection as the cornerstone.
    - The resurrection exposes the futility of all non-Christian philosophies.
    "The resurrection is the presupposition of all Christian thought and life." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Antithesis Between Old and New Creation**
    - There is a radical distinction between the fallen order and the new creation.
    - The resurrection marks the decisive victory over sin, death, and Satan.
    - Believers are called to live out the reality of the new creation in the present age.
    - The antithesis is epistemological as well as ethical and eschatological.
    "The old and new creations stand in absolute antithesis, as do the principles that govern them." (A Christian Theory of Knowledge)

5. **Eschatological Consummation in Christ**
    - The resurrection points forward to the final **eschatological renewal** of all things.
    - Christ is the pattern and guarantee of the believer’s future resurrection.
    - The new creation will be fully realized at Christ’s return.
    - The hope of resurrection shapes the church’s mission and perseverance.
    "The resurrection assures us that the end of history is the beginning of the new creation in Christ." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **resurrection** and **new creation** within a presuppositional and covenantal framework has profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and theology. His emphasis on the centrality of Christ’s resurrection as the foundation for all Christian thought continues to influence discussions on **eschatology** and the nature of redemptive history. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of covenantal apologetics and the robust defense of the resurrection as the cornerstone of the Christian faith.
