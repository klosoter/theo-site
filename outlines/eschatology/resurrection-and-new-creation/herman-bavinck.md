# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck’s doctrine of **resurrection** and **new creation** is deeply rooted in the unity of **creation, redemption, and consummation**. He emphasizes the **bodily resurrection** as essential to Christian hope and sees the **new creation** as the restoration and transformation of the entire cosmos through Christ, not merely the salvation of individual souls. For Bavinck, the resurrection is the pivotal event that inaugurates the renewal of all things, affirming the goodness of creation and the ultimate victory of God’s redemptive purposes.

- "The resurrection is not a return to the old but an advance to the new, the completion of God’s work of re-creation." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:720)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Bodily and Cosmic**
    - The resurrection involves the actual, physical bodies of believers, not just spiritual existence.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the firstfruits and guarantee of the resurrection of all who are in Him.
    - The resurrection signals the renewal of the entire created order, not its abandonment.
    - The hope of resurrection affirms the enduring value of material creation.
    - "The resurrection of the body is the completion of the work of redemption, extending to the whole person and, in principle, to all creation." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:719)

2. **New Creation as Consummation of Redemption**
    - The new creation is the final goal of God’s redemptive plan, not a mere return to Eden.
    - Redemption restores and perfects creation, bringing it to its intended telos.
    - The new heavens and new earth are a transformed, glorified reality, not an annihilation of the old.
    - The work of Christ encompasses both individual salvation and cosmic renewal.
    - "Grace restores nature, and in the new creation, nature reaches its highest destiny." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:715)

3. **Christ’s Resurrection as the Foundation**
    - The resurrection of Christ is the historical and theological cornerstone of Christian hope.
    - Christ’s victory over death inaugurates the new creation and secures believers’ resurrection.
    - The resurrection is both a past event and a future promise for all who are united to Christ.
    - The eschatological transformation of creation is grounded in the risen Christ.
    - "Christ’s resurrection is the principle and pledge of the resurrection of all believers and the renewal of the world." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:614)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity in New Creation**
    - The new creation maintains continuity with the present world, yet is radically transformed.
    - There is both identity and difference between the old and new: the same creation, glorified.
    - Human culture and history have enduring significance, purified and perfected in the new creation.
    - The resurrection body is both recognizable and gloriously changed.
    - "The new creation is not a second, wholly other world, but this world cleansed from sin and glorified." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:720)

5. **Eschatological Hope Shapes Present Life**
    - The certainty of resurrection and new creation motivates ethical living and cultural engagement.
    - Christian hope is not escapist but anticipates the fulfillment of God’s purposes in history.
    - The church lives as a sign and foretaste of the coming new creation.
    - Suffering and death are given meaning in light of the promised resurrection.
    - "The future life is not a negation but a fulfillment of the present, the realization of all that God intended in creation." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:715)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust doctrine of **resurrection** and **new creation** has profoundly shaped Reformed eschatology, emphasizing the cosmic scope of redemption and the goodness of creation. His integration of **creation, fall, and redemption** provides a holistic vision that resists dualism and affirms the hope of bodily resurrection. Bavinck’s thought continues to influence contemporary theology, especially in discussions on the relationship between nature and grace, and the ultimate destiny of the world in Christ.
