# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—affirm the centrality of the **resurrection of Christ** as the foundation for the believer’s **justification**, **sanctification**, and hope in the **new creation**. These confessions emphasize that Christ’s bodily resurrection guarantees the future resurrection of believers and the renewal of all things, rooting Christian assurance in the historical and eschatological work of Christ.

- "Christ’s resurrection is a sure pledge to us of our blessed resurrection." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 45)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Foundation of Salvation**
   - Christ’s resurrection is essential for the believer’s **justification** and **sanctification**.
   - The confessions teach that Christ’s victory over death is imputed to believers.
   - The resurrection is not merely symbolic but a real, historical event.
   - Assurance of salvation is grounded in Christ’s risen life.
   "By his resurrection he has overcome death, that he might make us partakers of the righteousness which he has obtained for us by his death." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 45)

2. **Bodily Resurrection of Believers**
   - The future resurrection will be physical, not merely spiritual.
   - Believers will be raised incorruptible, sharing in Christ’s glorified life.
   - The confessions reject any notion of soul-only immortality apart from bodily resurrection.
   - The resurrection is linked to the final **judgment** and consummation.
   "Our very flesh, raised by the power of Christ, shall be reunited with our souls and made like Christ’s glorious body." (Belgic Confession, Article 37)

3. **New Creation as Eschatological Hope**
   - The confessions anticipate a renewed **heavens and earth**.
   - The **new creation** is the ultimate fulfillment of redemption.
   - Believers will dwell eternally with God in a restored creation.
   - The resurrection inaugurates the new age, but its fullness awaits Christ’s return.
   "We look for that blessed hope and glorious appearing… when he will make all things new." (Belgic Confession, Article 37)

4. **Union with Christ in Resurrection**
   - Believers are united to Christ in his death and resurrection.
   - This union is the basis for present spiritual renewal and future bodily resurrection.
   - The confessions stress the ongoing benefits of Christ’s resurrection for the church.
   - The Spirit applies Christ’s resurrection power to believers now and in the age to come.
   "By his power we are already now raised to a new life." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 45)

5. **Resurrection and Justification by Faith Alone**
   - **Justification** is grounded in Christ’s resurrection as vindication of his atoning work.
   - Faith alone receives the benefits of the risen Christ.
   - The confessions reject any human contribution to resurrection life.
   - The resurrection assures believers of their acceptance before God.
   "He was raised for our justification." (Canons of Dort, II.8)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the **resurrection** and **new creation**, providing a confessional anchor for doctrines of hope, assurance, and eschatology. Their clear articulation of bodily resurrection and the renewal of all things continues to inform Reformed preaching, catechesis, and pastoral care. By rooting Christian hope in Christ’s historical resurrection and the promise of a new creation, these confessions remain foundational for Reformed identity and witness.
