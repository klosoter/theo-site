# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **resurrection** and **new creation** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the centrality of Christ’s resurrection as the foundation for Christian hope and the renewal of all things. He viewed the **new creation** not as a mere continuation of the present order but as a radical transformation initiated by God, grounded in the reality of Christ’s victory over death. Brunner’s theology stressed the existential and relational dimensions of resurrection, focusing on the restoration of fellowship with God.

- "The resurrection is not the reanimation of a corpse, but the new creation of man by God’s creative act." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Eternal Hope
- Man in Revolt
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Divine Act**
    - Resurrection is a unique, unrepeatable act of God, not a natural process.
    - It signifies God’s definitive intervention in history through Christ.
    - The event is foundational for Christian faith and hope.
    - Resurrection is not accessible to empirical verification but is received by faith.
    - "The resurrection is the act of God, not the continuation of the natural process of life." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

2. **New Creation as Eschatological Reality**
    - The new creation is inaugurated in Christ’s resurrection but awaits consummation.
    - It represents a total renewal, not merely moral improvement or spiritualization.
    - The old creation is surpassed, not simply restored.
    - Eschatology is central to understanding Christian existence and hope.
    - "The new creation is not a return to the old, but the coming of something wholly new." (Eternal Hope)

3. **Christocentric Focus**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the prototype and guarantee of believers’ resurrection.
    - All hope for new creation is anchored in the person and work of Christ.
    - The resurrection event is the decisive revelation of God’s purpose for humanity.
    - Salvation history culminates in Christ’s victory over death.
    - "In Christ, the new creation has already begun." (The Mediator)

4. **Existential and Relational Emphasis**
    - Resurrection and new creation restore the broken relationship between God and humanity.
    - The transformation is personal and communal, not merely individual.
    - Faith is an encounter with the risen Christ, not assent to abstract doctrine.
    - The new creation involves a new mode of being-in-relationship with God.
    - "Faith in the resurrection is faith in the living encounter with God." (Truth as Encounter)

5. **Rejection of Immortality of the Soul**
    - Brunner denies the Greek notion of the soul’s inherent immortality.
    - Resurrection is about God’s re-creation, not the survival of a spiritual substance.
    - Human hope is grounded in God’s promise, not in human nature.
    - The biblical view is holistic, affirming bodily resurrection.
    - "The Christian hope is not for the immortality of the soul, but for the resurrection of the body." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s articulation of **resurrection** and **new creation** shaped 20th-century Protestant theology by emphasizing the radical discontinuity between the old and new orders and the centrality of Christ’s resurrection. His existential and relational approach influenced later discussions on eschatology and the meaning of Christian hope. Brunner’s rejection of the immortality of the soul in favor of bodily resurrection contributed to renewed biblical realism in modern theology. His work remains a significant reference point for those exploring the intersection of **Christology**, eschatology, and human destiny.
