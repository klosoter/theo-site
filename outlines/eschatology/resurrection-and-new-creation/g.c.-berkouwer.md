# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer placed the **resurrection** and **new creation** at the heart of **redemptive history**, arguing that these are inseparable from the work of **Christ** and the fulfillment of **eschatological hope**. He maintained that the resurrection is not merely a past event, but the foundation for the renewal of all things, culminating in the **consummation** of the **kingdom of God**.

- "The resurrection is not an isolated miracle, but the beginning of the new creation." (The Return of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Return of Christ
- The Work of Christ
- Faith and Perseverance
- The Second Vatican Council and the New Catholicism
- Studies in Dogmatics (especially volumes on eschatology and Christology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as the Inauguration of New Creation**
    - The resurrection of Christ marks the decisive turning point in **redemptive history**.
    - It is the guarantee and firstfruits of the **new creation** promised in Scripture.
    - The resurrection is not just a spiritual reality but involves the renewal of the whole person.
    - This event signals the beginning of the eschatological age.
    "The resurrection is the dawn of the new world, the new creation, in which the old has passed away." (The Return of Christ)

2. **Eschatological Fulfillment Rooted in Christ**
    - The hope of **new creation** is grounded in the historical resurrection of Jesus.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the pledge of the final **consummation** for all believers.
    - The eschaton is not a mere future ideal but is anchored in the present reality of Christ’s victory.
    - The resurrection assures believers of their participation in the coming renewal.
    "The resurrection is the pledge of the eschatological future, already breaking into our present." (The Return of Christ)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity in New Creation**
    - Berkouwer affirms both continuity and transformation between the present world and the new creation.
    - The resurrection body of Christ is paradigmatic for the believer’s future existence.
    - The new creation is not a negation but a renewal of creation’s original goodness.
    - Sin and death are decisively overcome, but creation’s identity is preserved.
    "The new creation does not destroy the old, but transforms it in the power of Christ’s resurrection." (The Return of Christ)

4. **Resurrection and Justification**
    - The resurrection is inseparable from the doctrine of **justification**.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the divine affirmation of His redemptive work.
    - Believers are justified and assured of new life through union with the risen Christ.
    - Justification and new creation are two aspects of the same salvific reality.
    "Justification and new creation are not two separate gifts, but one reality in Christ." (Faith and Perseverance)

5. **Ethical and Ecclesial Implications**
    - The resurrection calls the church to live as a **new creation** community.
    - Christian ethics are shaped by the reality of resurrection life.
    - The church’s mission is to witness to the coming kingdom in word and deed.
    - The anticipation of new creation energizes perseverance and hope.
    "The church is called to embody the life of the new creation in the midst of the old." (The Return of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s articulation of **resurrection** and **new creation** has significantly shaped Reformed eschatology by emphasizing the unity of **redemption** and **consummation** in Christ. His nuanced approach to the continuity between creation and new creation offered a robust alternative to dualistic or purely spiritualized eschatologies. Berkouwer’s influence continues in contemporary discussions of **eschatological hope**, the meaning of resurrection, and the church’s identity as a sign of the coming kingdom.
