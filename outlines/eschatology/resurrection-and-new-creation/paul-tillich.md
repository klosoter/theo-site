# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **resurrection** and **new creation** not as literal historical events, but as symbols of the ultimate victory of **Being over non-being** and the transformative power of **New Being in Christ**. For Tillich, the resurrection signifies the existential reality of **salvation** and the breaking in of the **Kingdom of God** within the structures of existence, pointing to the renewal of both individual and communal life.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the symbol of the New Being, conquering the old existence under the conditions of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Symbolic Event**
    - The resurrection is not a physical resuscitation but a symbol of the **New Being**.
    - It expresses the victory of **life over death** and **meaning over meaninglessness**.
    - The event points to the existential transformation possible for all humanity.
    - The resurrection is central to the Christian message, but its truth is grasped through **faith**, not empirical evidence.
    - "The resurrection is not the return to this finite existence but the manifestation of the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **New Creation as Existential Renewal**
    - **New creation** refers to the transformation of existence through participation in the **New Being**.
    - It is realized wherever the **power of Christ** overcomes estrangement and alienation.
    - The new creation is both a present reality and an eschatological hope.
    - It involves the renewal of both individuals and communities in the **Spirit**.
    - "The new creation is the actualization of the New Being in the personal and social life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Christ as the Bearer of New Being**
    - Christ is the concrete manifestation of the **New Being** that overcomes the existential predicament.
    - In Christ, the separation between God and humanity is healed.
    - The resurrection is the decisive event in which the **New Being** is revealed.
    - Faith in Christ enables participation in the **new creation**.
    - "In him the New Being has appeared, and in his resurrection it has conquered the old being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Kingdom of God as Symbol of Fulfillment**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is a symbol for the ultimate fulfillment of existence.
    - It is not a political or historical reality but a spiritual and existential one.
    - The resurrection points to the coming of the Kingdom as the triumph of **meaning**.
    - The Kingdom is already present wherever the **New Being** is actualized.
    - "The Kingdom of God is the state of things in which the New Being is universally manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Faith as Participation in Resurrection and New Creation**
    - Faith is the existential act of accepting the **New Being** revealed in Christ.
    - Through faith, individuals participate in the resurrection and the **new creation**.
    - Faith transforms anxiety, despair, and estrangement into courage and hope.
    - The resurrection becomes real for the believer in the existential encounter with Christ.
    - "Faith is the state of being grasped by the power of the New Being, which is manifest in the resurrection." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s interpretation of **resurrection** and **new creation** as existential and symbolic realities has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the dialogue between theology and existential philosophy. His emphasis on the **New Being** and the transformative power of faith continues to shape discussions on the meaning of salvation and eschatology in contemporary thought. While his approach has been critiqued for its lack of historical concreteness, Tillich remains a pivotal figure in the development of **systematic theology** and the reinterpretation of Christian doctrines for the modern world.
