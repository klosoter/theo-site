# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated a robust theology of the **resurrection** and **new creation** within the framework of **redemptive history**. He emphasized the resurrection of Christ as the decisive inbreaking of the **eschatological age**, inaugurating the **new creation** and guaranteeing the future resurrection of believers. Vos’s approach integrates **biblical theology** with systematic categories, highlighting the organic unity of God’s redemptive work.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new world, the new creation, and as such it is the principle of the resurrection of believers." (Pauline Eschatology)

## Key Works

- The Pauline Eschatology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics (especially Vol. 4: Soteriology)
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit" (Princeton Theological Review, 1900)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Eschatological Event**
    - The resurrection of Christ marks the arrival of the **eschaton** within history.
    - It is not merely a return to life but the inauguration of the **age to come**.
    - The resurrection is the firstfruits, guaranteeing the resurrection of all who are united to Christ.
    - This event is central to the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - "The resurrection is the supreme manifestation of the eschatological character of Christianity." (Pauline Eschatology)

2. **Organic Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Vos insists on the continuity between **creation**, **fall**, and **redemption**.
    - The new creation is not a replacement but a consummation of the original creation.
    - Christ’s resurrection is organically connected to God’s purposes from Genesis to Revelation.
    - The new creation fulfills the trajectory set in the Old Testament promises.
    - "Redemptive revelation moves forward organically, culminating in the resurrection." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Christ as the Firstfruits of New Creation**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the prototype and guarantee of the believer’s resurrection.
    - The new creation is already present in Christ, though not yet consummated.
    - Believers participate in the new creation through union with the risen Christ.
    - The Spirit mediates this participation, applying resurrection life to the church.
    - "In Christ’s resurrection, the new creation has already begun." (Pauline Eschatology)

4. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - Vos pioneered the distinction between the **inaugurated** and **consummated** aspects of eschatology.
    - The resurrection brings the powers of the age to come into the present.
    - Believers live in the tension between the already-realized new creation and its future fullness.
    - This framework shapes Christian hope and ethical living.
    - "The age to come has penetrated this age through the resurrection of Christ." (Pauline Eschatology)

5. **Biblical-Theological Method**
    - Vos’s approach grounds doctrine in the unfolding drama of Scripture.
    - He reads the resurrection and new creation as central motifs in the Bible’s storyline.
    - Systematic theology must be informed by the progress of revelation.
    - The unity of Scripture is seen in the movement from creation to new creation.
    - "Biblical theology shows how the resurrection is woven into the fabric of revelation." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s theology of **resurrection** and **new creation** has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially through his emphasis on **eschatological fulfillment** in Christ. His insights laid the groundwork for later developments in the “already/not yet” paradigm and influenced generations of scholars at Westminster and beyond. Vos’s integration of redemptive history with systematic categories continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between **creation, redemption, and consummation**. His work remains foundational for understanding the centrality of resurrection in Christian hope.
