# Michael Horton (1964– )

Michael Horton articulates a robust theology of **resurrection** and **new creation** grounded in the drama of **redemption accomplished and applied**. He emphasizes the centrality of Christ’s bodily resurrection as the inauguration of the **eschatological new creation**, linking individual salvation to the cosmic renewal of all things in Christ. Horton’s approach situates the resurrection within the broader framework of **covenant theology** and the unfolding of **redemptive history**.

- "The resurrection is not merely a happy ending for Jesus but the beginning of the new creation for the world." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Inauguration of New Creation**
    - The resurrection of Christ is the definitive event that inaugurates the **new creation**.
    - It is both a historical event and an eschatological reality, bridging the "already" and "not yet."
    - Christ’s resurrection is the firstfruits, guaranteeing the resurrection of believers and the renewal of the cosmos.
    - The new creation is not merely spiritual but includes the restoration of the material world.
    - "Christ’s resurrection is the pledge and pattern of the new creation that has already dawned in history." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Union with Christ in Resurrection**
    - Believers are united to Christ by the Holy Spirit, sharing in his resurrection life.
    - This union grounds both justification and sanctification in the reality of the risen Christ.
    - The resurrection is not just an event to be believed but a reality to be participated in.
    - The benefits of the resurrection are applied through the means of grace in the church.
    - "Our union with Christ means that his resurrection is ours, both now and in the age to come." (Pilgrim Theology)

3. **Covenant and Redemptive-Historical Framework**
    - The resurrection fulfills the promises of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Horton situates resurrection within the unfolding drama of **redemptive history**.
    - The new creation is the telos of God’s covenantal dealings with humanity.
    - The resurrection is the climactic act in the divine drama, securing the future restoration of all things.
    - "The resurrection is the covenantal hinge between the old age and the age to come." (Covenant and Eschatology)

4. **Eschatological Hope and Bodily Renewal**
    - The resurrection grounds Christian hope in the bodily renewal of believers and the world.
    - Horton rejects any dualism that would separate spiritual salvation from physical restoration.
    - The future resurrection is the consummation of what began in Christ’s resurrection.
    - The church lives in anticipation of the final new creation, marked by hope and mission.
    - "The resurrection assures us that redemption is as comprehensive as the fall." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Resurrection and Ecclesiology**
    - The church is the community of the new creation, shaped by the resurrection.
    - Through Word and sacrament, the church participates in the life of the risen Christ.
    - The resurrection empowers the church’s mission as a sign and foretaste of the new creation.
    - Ecclesial life is oriented toward the eschatological renewal of all things.
    - "The church is the outpost of the new creation in the present age." (People and Place)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Horton’s theology of **resurrection** and **new creation** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed thought, especially in its integration of **covenant theology** and eschatology. His emphasis on the cosmic scope of redemption challenges reductionistic views of salvation and underscores the hope of bodily and material renewal. Horton’s work continues to influence pastors, scholars, and laypeople, fostering a holistic vision of Christian hope rooted in the resurrection of Christ.
