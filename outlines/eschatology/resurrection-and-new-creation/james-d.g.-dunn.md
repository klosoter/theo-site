# James D.G. Dunn (1939–2020)

James D.G. Dunn emphasized the **bodily resurrection** of Jesus as the foundation of Christian faith and the inauguration of the **new creation**. He argued that the resurrection is both a historical and eschatological event, marking the beginning of God's **eschatological renewal** and the anticipated transformation of all creation.

- "The resurrection of Jesus is not just a miracle; it is the beginning of the new creation." (The Theology of Paul the Apostle)

## Key Works

- The Theology of Paul the Apostle
- Jesus and the Spirit

- Did the First Christians Worship Jesus?

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bodily Resurrection as Historical and Eschatological**
    - Affirms the **physical resurrection** of Jesus as a real, historical event.
    - Sees resurrection as the turning point in **salvation history**.
    - Connects Jesus’ resurrection to the future resurrection of believers.
    - Emphasizes continuity between Jesus’ risen body and the coming **new creation**.
    - "The resurrection is both a historical event and an eschatological signpost." (The Theology of Paul the Apostle)

2. **Resurrection as Inauguration of New Creation**
    - Resurrection signals the beginning of God’s **eschatological renewal**.
    - The new creation is already present in Christ’s resurrection, though not yet fully realized.
    - Believers participate in the new creation through union with the risen Christ.
    - The resurrection anticipates the ultimate transformation of the cosmos.
    - "In the resurrection, the new creation has already begun, though its completion awaits the end." (The Theology of Paul the Apostle)

3. **Corporate and Cosmic Dimensions**
    - Resurrection is not just individual but has **corporate** implications for the people of God.
    - Stresses the cosmic scope: all creation will be renewed, not just humanity.
    - Paul’s theology links resurrection to the redemption of the whole created order.
    - The church is the firstfruits of the new creation, embodying resurrection life.
    - "The resurrection points to a cosmic renewal, not simply individual salvation." (The Theology of Paul the Apostle)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Resurrection**
    - Maintains continuity between the present creation and the new creation.
    - Resurrection involves transformation, not annihilation, of the old order.
    - The risen Christ is both recognizable and gloriously changed.
    - The new creation fulfills, rather than abolishes, the original creation.
    - "The resurrection body is both continuous with and transformed from the present body." (The Theology of Paul the Apostle)

5. **Resurrection Faith and Christian Hope**
    - Resurrection is central to **Christian hope** and ethical living.
    - The resurrection grounds the believer’s assurance of future renewal.
    - Shapes Christian mission as participation in God’s renewing work.
    - Calls the church to live as a sign of the coming new creation.
    - "Faith in the resurrection is faith in the God who brings life out of death and hope out of despair." (The Evidence for Jesus)

## Legacy and Impact

Dunn’s work on the **resurrection** and **new creation** has significantly shaped contemporary New Testament scholarship, especially in Pauline studies. His emphasis on the bodily and cosmic dimensions of resurrection challenged reductionist readings and highlighted the eschatological thrust of early Christian faith. By connecting resurrection to the broader theme of new creation, Dunn provided a robust framework for understanding Christian hope and mission. His scholarship continues to influence debates on the nature of resurrection and the scope of God’s redemptive purposes.
