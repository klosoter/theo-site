# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **resurrection** and **new creation** is rooted in his understanding of the **bodily resurrection**, the transformation of the **created order**, and the ultimate fulfillment of **God’s redemptive plan**. He affirms the continuity between the present body and the resurrected body, while emphasizing its glorification and incorruptibility in the **eschaton**. For Augustine, the resurrection inaugurates the **consummation of all things**, where the redeemed participate in the eternal **City of God**.

- "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." (City of God, XXII.13)

## Key Works

- City of God (De Civitate Dei), especially Books XX–XXII
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- Sermons on the Liturgical Seasons (esp. Easter)
- On the Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad Litteram)
- Confessions (Book XIII)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bodily Resurrection is Real and Physical**
    - The resurrection involves the actual, material bodies of the dead being raised.
    - There is continuity between the mortal body and the resurrected body, though transformed.
    - The resurrected body is incorruptible, immune to suffering and death.
    - Augustine opposes purely spiritualized or allegorical interpretations of resurrection.
    - "The flesh will rise again, not as a spirit, but as a body made spiritual." (City of God, XXII.21)

2. **Transformation and Glorification of Creation**
    - The new creation entails the renewal and perfection of the entire cosmos.
    - Creation itself will be set free from corruption and futility.
    - The beauty and order of the new creation will surpass the original.
    - The new creation is the context for the eternal blessedness of the redeemed.
    - "God shall be the end of all our desires, who will be seen without end, loved without cloy, praised without weariness." (City of God, XXII.30)

3. **Resurrection as Fulfillment of Redemptive History**
    - The resurrection is the climax of God’s plan to restore fallen humanity.
    - It is grounded in the resurrection of Christ as the firstfruits.
    - The resurrection vindicates the justice and mercy of God.
    - It inaugurates the final state of the **City of God**.
    - "The resurrection of the body is the reward of the faith and hope of the righteous." (Enchiridion, 84)

4. **Eschatological Judgment and Twofold Destiny**
    - All will be raised, but to different destinies: eternal life or eternal punishment.
    - The righteous will enjoy unending communion with God; the wicked will face separation.
    - The resurrection is inseparable from the final judgment.
    - Augustine stresses the seriousness of the resurrection for moral and spiritual life now.
    - "There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust." (City of God, XX.6)

5. **Participation in the City of God**
    - The resurrected saints will dwell eternally in the **City of God**.
    - This community is marked by perfect peace, love, and worship.
    - The vision of God (beatific vision) is the highest good of the new creation.
    - The City of God stands in contrast to the earthly city, which is destined for passing away.
    - "There we shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise." (City of God, XXII.30)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **resurrection** and **new creation** profoundly shaped Western Christian eschatology, especially in affirming the goodness of the body and the hope of a renewed cosmos. His vision of the **City of God** as the consummate community of the redeemed has influenced both theological and philosophical understandings of history and destiny. Augustine’s insistence on the physicality of resurrection and the transformation of creation remains foundational for orthodox Christian doctrine.
