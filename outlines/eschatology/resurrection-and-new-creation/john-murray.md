# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the **resurrection** and **new creation** as central realities in the unfolding of **redemptive history**, emphasizing their inseparability from the work of **Christ** and the consummation of **eschatological hope**. He saw the resurrection not merely as an event in the past or future, but as the decisive inauguration of the **new creation** order, grounded in union with Christ and the fulfillment of the **covenant of grace**.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event in the accomplishment of redemption and the harbinger of the new creation." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as the Climax of Redemption**
    - The resurrection is the definitive validation of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - It marks the transition from humiliation to exaltation in the person of Christ.
    - The resurrection is essential for the application of salvation to believers.
    - It inaugurates the new age and guarantees the believer’s future resurrection.
    - "The resurrection is the seal of the finished work of Christ." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Union with Christ in Resurrection**
    - Believers are united to Christ in his death and resurrection.
    - This union is both judicial (justification) and transformative (sanctification).
    - The resurrection life is imparted to believers through the Holy Spirit.
    - Union with Christ ensures participation in the new creation.
    - "Our resurrection with Christ is the pledge and pattern of our own resurrection." (Romans)

3. **Eschatological New Creation**
    - The new creation is both inaugurated and awaited in the present age.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits of the cosmic renewal.
    - The consummation will bring about the restoration of all things.
    - The new creation is the fulfillment of God’s redemptive purpose in history.
    - "The resurrection is the beginning of the new creation, the first installment of the eschatological hope." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Bodily Resurrection and Continuity**
    - The resurrection affirms the goodness and destiny of the body.
    - There is continuity between the present body and the resurrection body.
    - The bodily resurrection is essential for the completion of redemption.
    - The new creation involves the renewal of the whole person, body and soul.
    - "Redemption would not be complete apart from the resurrection of the body." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Covenant Fulfillment in Resurrection and New Creation**
    - The resurrection fulfills the promises of the covenant of grace.
    - It secures the inheritance promised to Abraham and his seed.
    - The new creation is the ultimate realization of God’s covenantal purposes.
    - The resurrection is the guarantee of the believer’s participation in the new heavens and new earth.
    - "The resurrection is the crowning fulfillment of the covenant promises." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of **resurrection** and **new creation** has shaped Reformed soteriology and eschatology, especially in emphasizing the centrality of union with Christ. His insistence on the bodily and cosmic dimensions of redemption has influenced subsequent discussions on the scope of salvation and the nature of Christian hope. Murray’s careful exegesis and theological synthesis continue to inform contemporary Reformed thought on the consummation of God’s redemptive plan.
