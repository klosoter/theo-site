# Vern Poythress (1946–)

Vern Poythress approaches the **resurrection** and **new creation** with a distinctly **Trinitarian** and **redemptive-historical** focus, emphasizing the cosmic scope of Christ’s victory and the fulfillment of God’s purposes for both humanity and the cosmos. He employs **multiperspectivalism** and **biblical theology** to show how the resurrection inaugurates the new creation and unites believers to Christ.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new creation, the firstfruits of the renewal of all things." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

## Key Works

- The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses
- Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach
- In the Beginning Was the Word: Language—A God-Centered Approach
- Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology
- Theophany: A Biblical Theology of God’s Appearing

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Inauguration of New Creation**
    - The resurrection of Christ is the decisive event that initiates the **new creation**.
    - Christ’s resurrection is both a historical event and an eschatological turning point.
    - The resurrection fulfills Old Testament patterns and promises of renewal.
    - Believers participate in the new creation through union with the risen Christ.
    "The resurrection is not merely a return to life, but the beginning of a new order." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

2. **Multiperspectival Approach to Resurrection**
    - Resurrection is understood through multiple biblical perspectives: historical, theological, and existential.
    - Each perspective enriches understanding without reducing the resurrection to a single dimension.
    - Multiperspectivalism guards against reductionism in doctrinal formulation.
    - This approach highlights the unity and diversity of biblical revelation about new creation.
    "We need to see the resurrection from the perspectives of history, theology, and personal transformation." (Symphonic Theology)

3. **Trinitarian Foundation of New Creation**
    - The new creation is the work of the **Triune God**: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - The Father raises the Son by the Spirit, manifesting the unity of divine action.
    - The Spirit applies resurrection life to believers, uniting them to Christ.
    - Trinitarian theology ensures the cosmic and relational scope of new creation.
    "The resurrection is a Trinitarian act, displaying the unity and power of God in redemption." (Redeeming Science)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Fulfillment**
    - The resurrection is the climax of the **redemptive-historical** storyline.
    - Old Testament types and shadows find fulfillment in Christ’s resurrection.
    - The new creation is anticipated in Israel’s history and realized in Christ.
    - The church lives in the tension of the already and not yet of new creation.
    "The resurrection fulfills the trajectory of promise and fulfillment that runs through all of Scripture." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

5. **Cosmic Scope of Redemption**
    - The resurrection signals not only personal salvation but the renewal of the entire cosmos.
    - Creation itself will be liberated from bondage through Christ’s resurrection.
    - The new creation encompasses all aspects of reality: physical, spiritual, and social.
    - Believers are called to live as agents of new creation in the present age.
    "The resurrection of Christ is the guarantee of the restoration of all things." (Redeeming Science)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s integration of **multiperspectivalism** and **redemptive-historical theology** has shaped contemporary Reformed approaches to the resurrection and new creation. His work encourages theologians to see the resurrection as both a historical event and the foundation for cosmic renewal. By rooting the new creation in the **Trinitarian** work of God, Poythress has contributed to a holistic and biblically grounded vision of redemption that influences both academic theology and pastoral ministry.
