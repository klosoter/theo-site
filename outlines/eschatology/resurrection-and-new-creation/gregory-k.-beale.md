# Greg K. Beale (1952– )

Greg K. Beale is a leading contemporary biblical theologian whose work on **resurrection** and **new creation** emphasizes the continuity between the Old and New Testaments. He argues that the **resurrection of Christ** inaugurates the **eschatological new creation**, fulfilling Old Testament promises and establishing the pattern for the future consummation of all things in Christ. Beale’s approach is marked by a strong commitment to **biblical-theological typology** and the centrality of **eschatology** in understanding redemptive history.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new creation, which will be consummated at his return." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- The Temple and the Church’s Mission: A Biblical Theology of the Dwelling Place of God
- The Book of Revelation (NIGTC)
- "The Eschatological Conception of New Testament Theology" (in Biblical Theology: Retrospect and Prospect)
- Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament (co-edited with D.A. Carson)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Inauguration of New Creation**
    - The resurrection of Jesus is the first act of the promised **new creation**.
    - Christ’s resurrection fulfills Old Testament **prophecies** about restoration and renewal.
    - The new creation is both an already-present reality and a future hope.
    - Believers participate in new creation life through union with the risen Christ.
    - "The resurrection is not merely a return to life but the beginning of a transformed, new-creation existence." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

2. **Eschatological Fulfillment in Christ**
    - Jesus’ resurrection marks the arrival of the **eschatological age**.
    - Old Testament expectations of cosmic renewal are realized in Christ’s victory over death.
    - The church lives in the tension of the “already” and “not yet” of new creation.
    - The final resurrection will consummate what began in Christ.
    - "The resurrection is the turning point of the ages, inaugurating the end-time new creation." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

3. **Temple and New Creation Motif**
    - The biblical temple is a type of the **cosmic new creation**.
    - Christ as the true temple embodies God’s presence and inaugurates the new creation.
    - The church, as Christ’s body, is the temple and locus of new creation life.
    - The ultimate new creation is depicted as a temple-city in Revelation.
    - "The temple is a microcosm of the new creation, and Christ’s resurrection is the cornerstone of that reality." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

4. **Typology and Continuity of Redemptive History**
    - Old Testament types and patterns find their fulfillment in Christ’s resurrection and new creation.
    - Typology demonstrates the unity of God’s redemptive plan across the covenants.
    - The exodus, return from exile, and temple restoration prefigure the resurrection event.
    - The new creation is the climactic fulfillment of all biblical typology.
    - "Typology is the divinely intended correspondence between earlier and later acts of God, culminating in Christ and the new creation." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

5. **Cosmic and Corporate Dimensions of New Creation**
    - New creation encompasses both individual and cosmic renewal.
    - The resurrection signals the restoration of all creation, not just humanity.
    - The church is the firstfruits of the renewed cosmos.
    - The consummation will involve the transformation of the entire created order.
    - "The new creation inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection is both cosmic and corporate, involving the renewal of all things." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **biblical theology**, especially regarding the integration of **resurrection** and **new creation** themes across Scripture. His emphasis on typology and the continuity of redemptive history has influenced both Reformed and evangelical scholarship. By grounding eschatology in the resurrection of Christ, Beale provides a robust framework for understanding the church’s identity and mission within God’s unfolding plan. His scholarship continues to inform discussions on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments and the ultimate hope of cosmic renewal.
