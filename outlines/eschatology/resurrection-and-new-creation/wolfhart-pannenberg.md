# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg placed the **resurrection of Jesus** at the center of Christian theology, viewing it as the decisive event that inaugurates the **new creation** and grounds all **eschatological hope**. He argued that the resurrection is not merely an isolated miracle but the proleptic realization of the **eschaton**, revealing the destiny of all creation and validating the truth of **revelation** in history.

- "The resurrection of Jesus is the anticipation of the end of history within history itself." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Key Works

- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (1991)
- Theology and the Kingdom of God (1969)
- Revelation as History (1968, ed. with R. E. C. Browne)
- The Idea of God and Human Freedom (1973)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Historical Event**
    - The resurrection is a real, public event in history, not a myth or subjective experience.
    - It provides the objective foundation for Christian faith and proclamation.
    - The historicity of the resurrection is essential for the credibility of Christian claims.
    - The event is open to critical historical investigation and is not confined to private religious experience.
    - "If Jesus has not been raised, then the Christian faith is groundless." (Jesus—God and Man)

2. **Eschatology Realized in History**
    - The resurrection is the inbreaking of the **eschaton** into the present age.
    - It anticipates the final consummation of **new creation** for all humanity and the cosmos.
    - History is oriented toward its fulfillment in the resurrection event.
    - The resurrection reveals the ultimate destiny of creation within temporal reality.
    - "The resurrection is the prolepsis of the end of history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Christology and Revelation**
    - The resurrection vindicates Jesus’ identity as the Son of God and the locus of **revelation**.
    - It is the decisive self-disclosure of God in history.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the criterion for all theological truth claims.
    - The event unites **Christology** and **eschatology** in a single act of God.
    - "Only the resurrection makes Jesus’ claim to divine sonship credible." (Jesus—God and Man)

4. **Universal Scope of New Creation**
    - The resurrection points to the transformation of all creation, not just individual salvation.
    - It signals the beginning of the **new creation** that will encompass the entire cosmos.
    - Human destiny is inseparable from the renewal of the world.
    - The resurrection is the pledge of cosmic redemption and restoration.
    - "The resurrection of Jesus is the foundation of hope for the renewal of all things." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Integration of History and Theology**
    - Theology must be grounded in the public, historical reality of the resurrection.
    - The meaning of history is disclosed through the resurrection event.
    - Faith and reason are integrated through the historical investigation of Jesus’ resurrection.
    - The resurrection bridges the gap between historical fact and theological interpretation.
    - "Theology must take its stand on the historical reality of the resurrection." (Revelation as History)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s robust emphasis on the **resurrection as a historical and eschatological event** has profoundly influenced contemporary theology, especially in discussions of **revelation** and **eschatology**. His insistence on the public, historical nature of the resurrection challenged both existentialist and mythological reductions of Christian faith. By rooting the hope of **new creation** in the resurrection, Pannenberg provided a compelling vision for the integration of history, faith, and cosmic renewal. His work continues to shape debates on the relationship between history and theology in the modern era.
