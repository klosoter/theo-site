# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **bodily resurrection** as central to Christian hope, grounding it in the work of **Christ’s resurrection** as the firstfruits of the **new creation**. He emphasized the continuity between the present creation and its future renewal, insisting that the resurrection entails the restoration of the whole person and the cosmos through union with Christ.

- "For just as Christ is risen from the dead and will not die again, so we too shall rise from the dead and will never die again." (Luther’s Works, 28:111)

## Key Works

- Luther’s Small Catechism (especially the explanation of the Apostles’ Creed, Third Article)
- Sermons on 1 Corinthians 15
- Commentary on Genesis
- Commentary on Romans
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 28: Selected Pauline Epistles

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Centrality of Christ’s Resurrection**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the foundation and guarantee of believers’ own resurrection.
    - The resurrection is not merely spiritual but involves the transformation of the body.
    - Christ’s victory over death inaugurates the new creation.
    - Faith in the resurrection is essential for Christian assurance.
    - "He is the firstfruits, and we shall follow after." (Sermons on 1 Corinthians 15)

2. **Bodily Resurrection of Believers**
    - The resurrection involves the restoration of the whole person, body and soul.
    - Luther rejects any notion of a merely spiritual afterlife without bodily renewal.
    - The body will be raised incorruptible, patterned after Christ’s glorified body.
    - The resurrection affirms the goodness of God’s original creation.
    - "Our bodies will be made like unto His glorious body." (Small Catechism, Third Article)

3. **Continuity and Renewal of Creation**
    - The new creation is not a replacement but a renewal of the present world.
    - God will purify and restore creation, not annihilate it.
    - The resurrection signals the beginning of this cosmic renewal.
    - Creation’s destiny is tied to the resurrection of Christ and believers.
    - "God will create a new heaven and a new earth, not another but the same, cleansed from sin." (Commentary on Genesis)

4. **Union with Christ in Resurrection**
    - Believers are united to Christ in both death and resurrection.
    - This union assures participation in the new creation.
    - Baptism signifies and seals this union with Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - The resurrection life begins now in faith and will be consummated at Christ’s return.
    - "We are buried with Him by baptism into death, that we may also rise with Him." (Romans Commentary)

5. **Eschatological Hope and Assurance**
    - The resurrection grounds Christian hope in the ultimate defeat of death.
    - Assurance of resurrection shapes ethical living and perseverance.
    - The promise of new creation provides comfort amid suffering and mortality.
    - The resurrection is a future certainty, not mere wishful thinking.
    - "Because He lives, we also shall live." (Luther’s Works, 28:111)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust doctrine of the **resurrection and new creation** shaped Protestant eschatology, emphasizing the bodily and cosmic dimensions of redemption. His teaching influenced confessional documents and pastoral practice, rooting Christian hope in Christ’s victory over death. By insisting on the renewal of both humanity and creation, Luther contributed enduring clarity to the Reformation’s vision of salvation and ultimate restoration.
