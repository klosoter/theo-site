## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s integration of **resurrection** and **new creation** within a tri-perspectival, Reformed framework has influenced contemporary evangelical theology, especially in the areas of **systematic theology** and **Christian ethics**. His emphasis on the practical implications of these doctrines for the believer’s present life and future hope has shaped pastoral and academic discussions. Frame’s work continues to encourage a holistic, biblically grounded approach to eschatology and the Christian life.
