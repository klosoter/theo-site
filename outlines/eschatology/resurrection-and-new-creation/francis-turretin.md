# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust doctrine of the **resurrection** and **new creation** grounded in the authority of **Scripture** and the necessity of **Christ’s resurrection** as the foundation for the believer’s hope. He emphasized the **continuity and transformation** of the body, the centrality of **union with Christ**, and the eschatological renewal of all things as the consummation of **redemptive history**.

- "The resurrection of the body is not only possible, but also necessary, both on account of the justice of God and the consummation of the work of redemption." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 20.1.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 3, Topics 19–21)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected sermons and disputations on eschatology
- Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism" (for context)
- Richard Muller, "Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics" (secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Necessity and Certainty of Bodily Resurrection**
    - The resurrection is a revealed doctrine, not accessible by reason alone.
    - It is grounded in the **justice of God** and the victory of **Christ over death**.
    - The same bodies that die will be raised, though glorified.
    - Resurrection is essential for the consummation of **redemption**.
    - "The resurrection is not only possible, but also necessary, both from the promises of God and the indissoluble connection with Christ’s resurrection." (Institutes 20.1.1)

2. **Union with Christ as the Ground of Resurrection**
    - Believers’ resurrection is inseparably linked to **Christ’s resurrection**.
    - Christ is the "firstfruits," guaranteeing the resurrection of all united to Him.
    - Union with Christ ensures both spiritual and bodily renewal.
    - The benefits of Christ’s resurrection are applied through the Spirit.
    - "As Christ rose as the head, so must believers as his members rise also." (Institutes 20.3.7)

3. **Continuity and Transformation of the Body**
    - The same numerical body is raised, preserving personal identity.
    - The resurrected body is transformed: incorruptible, glorious, and spiritual.
    - Turretin rejects both annihilation and mere spiritual resurrection.
    - The transformation is a work of divine omnipotence, not natural process.
    - "The bodies of the saints will be the same in substance, but different in qualities." (Institutes 20.4.5)

4. **Cosmic Renewal and New Creation**
    - The **new creation** involves not only individuals but the renewal of the entire cosmos.
    - The world itself will be purified and restored, not annihilated.
    - The new heavens and new earth are the final state for the redeemed.
    - This cosmic renewal is the fulfillment of God’s original purpose in creation.
    - "The world will not be destroyed as to substance, but renewed as to quality." (Institutes 20.8.6)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment and Judgment**
    - The resurrection inaugurates the final judgment and eternal destinies.
    - Both the righteous and the wicked will be raised, but to different ends.
    - The resurrection vindicates God’s justice and mercy in Christ.
    - The new creation is the ultimate realization of the **kingdom of God**.
    - "The resurrection is the prelude to the last judgment, in which the justice of God will be perfectly manifested." (Institutes 20.9.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of the **resurrection** and **new creation** shaped later Reformed confessional standards and provided a systematic framework for eschatology in the tradition. His careful distinctions and defense of bodily resurrection influenced subsequent theologians, especially in debates over the nature of the intermediate state and the renewal of creation. Turretin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the hope of bodily resurrection and the consummation of all things in Christ.
