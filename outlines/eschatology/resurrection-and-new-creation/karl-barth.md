# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s doctrine of **resurrection** and **new creation** is rooted in the centrality of **Jesus Christ** as the decisive act of God’s self-revelation and reconciliation. For Barth, the resurrection is not merely a historical event but the inauguration of the **eschatological new creation**, where God’s sovereign act overcomes sin, death, and the old order, establishing the reality of **reconciliation** and **hope** for all creation.

- "The resurrection is the revelation of the new creation, of the world reconciled with God." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics IV/2: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics III/2: The Doctrine of Creation
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Dogmatics in Outline

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Resurrection**
   - The resurrection is the definitive act of **God in Christ**, revealing the new creation.
   - Jesus’ resurrection is not an isolated miracle but the center of all history and reality.
   - The event is both historical and supra-historical, grounding Christian hope.
   - Resurrection is inseparable from the person and work of Christ.
   - "In the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the new world of God has already dawned." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Eschatological New Creation**
   - The new creation is inaugurated in Christ’s resurrection but awaits consummation.
   - Eschatology is not a distant future but breaks into the present through Christ.
   - The resurrection is the pledge and beginning of the renewal of all things.
   - The church lives in the tension of the "already" and "not yet" of new creation.
   - "The resurrection is the beginning of the new creation, which will be completed at the end." (Dogmatics in Outline)

3. **Reconciliation and Victory over Sin and Death**
   - Resurrection is the public demonstration of God’s victory over sin and death.
   - Through resurrection, humanity is reconciled to God and creation is restored.
   - The old creation is judged and overcome in the resurrection event.
   - The new creation is characterized by restored relationship and peace with God.
   - "In the resurrection, the world is reconciled and death is vanquished." (Church Dogmatics IV/2)

4. **Objective Reality of Resurrection**
   - The resurrection is a real, objective event, not merely a subjective experience.
   - It is the foundation of Christian faith and proclamation.
   - The reality of resurrection shapes the church’s existence and mission.
   - Faith is a response to the reality God has established in Christ’s resurrection.
   - "The resurrection is not a myth, but the decisive event in which God’s truth is revealed." (The Epistle to the Romans)

5. **Cosmic Scope of Redemption**
   - The resurrection signals the renewal of all creation, not just individual salvation.
   - God’s redemptive work encompasses the whole cosmos.
   - The new creation involves the transformation of the world, not its abandonment.
   - The church is called to witness to this cosmic hope in the present age.
   - "The resurrection of Christ is the promise of the redemption of all creation." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s robust doctrine of **resurrection** and **new creation** has profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in its emphasis on the centrality of Christ and the cosmic scope of redemption. His insistence on the objective reality of resurrection challenged both liberal reductionism and existentialist interpretations. Barth’s vision of the new creation as both inaugurated and awaited continues to influence contemporary discussions on eschatology, reconciliation, and the mission of the church in the world.
