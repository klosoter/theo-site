# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **resurrection** and **new creation** through the lens of **demythologization**, arguing that these doctrines must be understood existentially rather than as historical or physical events. For Bultmann, the **resurrection of Christ** signifies the possibility of authentic existence and the breaking in of the **new creation** within the believer’s present experience, rather than a literal transformation of the cosmos or body.

- "The resurrection is not an event of past history; it is an event that has significance only for faith." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Kerygma and Myth (1941, with contributions by Bultmann)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Resurrection**
    - The **resurrection** narratives are mythological expressions, not historical reports.
    - Their true meaning is existential, calling individuals to faith.
    - The language of resurrection points to the possibility of new life in the present.
    - Historical investigation cannot access the event itself, only its proclamation.
    - "What matters is not whether the tomb was empty or not, but that the kerygma proclaims the possibility of new life." (Kerygma and Myth)

2. **Existential Interpretation of New Creation**
    - **New creation** is realized in the existential transformation of the believer.
    - It is not a future cosmic event but a present reality for those who respond in faith.
    - The believer participates in new creation by embracing authentic existence.
    - The eschatological hope is internalized as personal renewal.
    - "Eternal life is not a future event but a present reality for the believer." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Centrality of Kerygma**
    - The proclamation (kerygma) is the locus of resurrection and new creation.
    - Faith arises from hearing the kerygma, not from historical proofs.
    - The kerygma confronts the hearer with the demand for decision.
    - The resurrection is meaningful only as it is proclaimed and received in faith.
    - "Faith in the resurrection is faith in the kerygma, not in an event of past history." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Rejection of Objective Eschatology**
    - Bultmann denies a literal, future **eschatological** transformation of the world.
    - Eschatology is reinterpreted as the crisis of decision in the present.
    - The apocalyptic imagery of the New Testament is symbolic of existential realities.
    - The new age dawns whenever individuals respond to the call of Christ.
    - "Eschatology is not the end of world history but the end of my world." (History and Eschatology)

5. **Faith as Encounter with the Risen Christ**
    - The **resurrected Christ** is encountered in the proclamation, not in physical appearances.
    - Faith is a response to the existential call of Christ in the present.
    - The resurrection is the foundation for authentic existence, not a historical datum.
    - The believer’s life is marked by continual renewal in Christ.
    - "The resurrection means the possibility of a new existence here and now." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **resurrection** and **new creation** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **biblical hermeneutics** and existentialist interpretation. His method of **demythologization** remains controversial, provoking both strong criticism and significant development among later theologians. While many have rejected his dismissal of historical claims, his focus on the existential significance of Christian proclamation continues to influence discussions on the meaning of resurrection and new creation in contemporary theology.
