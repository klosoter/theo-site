# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

He insisted that Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the renewal of all things, grounding the believer’s hope in the ultimate restoration of both humanity and the created order under the reign of **Christ’s lordship**.

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s vision of **resurrection** and **new creation** profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in its emphasis on the cosmic dimensions of redemption. His insistence on the lordship of Christ over all creation inspired later movements in **neo-Calvinism** and Christian cultural engagement. Kuyper’s holistic eschatology continues to influence discussions on the relationship between salvation, creation, and the mission of the church. His legacy endures in the ongoing pursuit of a robust, world-affirming Christian worldview.
