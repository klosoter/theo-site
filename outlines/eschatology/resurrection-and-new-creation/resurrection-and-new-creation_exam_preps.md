### TITLE
Resurrection and New Creation: From Individual Hope to Eschatological Cosmos under the Lordship of the Risen Christ

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: how the **resurrection of Christ** grounds the **bodily resurrection** of believers and the **renewal of creation** such that eschatology is neither spiritualized nor collapsed into present history.
- Decisive figures: Irenaeus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Herman Bavinck, N. T. Wright.
- Relevant traditions: patristic anti-gnostic and anti-Origenist debates, Augustinian eschatology, medieval scholastic synthesis, Reformed confessional and **federal** theology, contemporary biblical-theological eschatology.
- Debates: internal – continuity and discontinuity between present and future creation, the nature of the resurrection body, millennial and kingdom-structure disputes; external – Gnostic and Platonizing spiritualization, Enlightenment naturalism and demythologization, liberal realized eschatology; contemporary – ecological theology, over-realized inaugurated eschatology, universalism, and the status of non-human creation.
- Defended position: bodily resurrection and **new creation** are historically grounded in Christ’s resurrection, ontologically continuous yet gloriously transformed, corporate and cosmic in scope, and must be articulated within classical theism, **union with Christ**, and a Reformed, covenantal, already–not-yet eschatology.

### ESSAY
Resurrection and new creation name the climactic acts of God by which he publicly vindicates his crucified Son, raises his people in glorified bodies, and transforms the whole created order into a state of incorruptible communion and sabbath rest. The controlling conviction I will defend is that the **resurrection of Christ** is both the historical hinge and ontological firstfruits of a comprehensive **new creation** that is bodily, corporate, covenantal, and cosmic, yet maintains real continuity with the present order while decisively judging and purging it. Any account that either spiritualizes this hope into mere survival of the soul, or collapses it into immanent progress within history, finally undermines the gospel’s coherence and the canonical narrative from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22.

The first decisive figure here is Irenaeus of Lyons, because he articulates resurrection and new creation within a comprehensive anti-gnostic theology of **recapitulation**. In Against Heresies, confronting Valentinian and other gnostic systems, he insists that the Creator of Genesis is the Father of Jesus Christ and that the created, material order is not a prison to be escaped but the proper arena of God’s saving action. For Irenaeus, the Son, by incarnation, passion, and resurrection, retraces and heals Adam’s history. This recapitulation is not merely moral but ontological: the Son assumes our flesh, lives a fully human life, dies, and rises in that same humanity. Thus the resurrection is the pledge that the same created nature once under Adamic headship is now under the second Adam, destined not for annihilation but transformation. Examiners will often press at this point: does Irenaeus leave room for a sharp eschatological discontinuity, or does his stress on continuity verge on universal restoration of all things including the wicked? The best reading is that his stress on continuity concerns the goodness and identity of creation and human nature, not the eternal destiny of every rational creature. For him, the judgment remains real; what is reclaimed in Christ is the created order as such and the people united to him. Yet Irenaeus’s insistence that God does not abandon the work of his hands profoundly shapes later Christian resistance to any eschatology that annihilates or replaces the created order rather than renewing it.

Augustine of Hippo systematizes this Irenaean trajectory within a far more expansive doctrinal synthesis. He is a decisive figure because he binds resurrection and new creation to a robust account of **original sin**, grace, and the two cities, and because he faces Platonist pressures both philosophically and pastorally. In City of God, especially books 19 to 22, Augustine defends the **bodily resurrection** of the just and unjust against pagan ridicule. He insists that the same numerical body is raised, though transformed: the body’s identity remains, though its corruptibility and disordered appetites are removed. Here a central examiner question arises: in what sense is the resurrected body “the same” if it is incorruptible, sexless in function, and glorified? Augustine answers with the metaphysical distinction between substance and quality. The substance of the body remains; its mortal qualities are altered. He therefore guards both continuity and discontinuity under the category of **glorification**, anchoring it in Christ’s own risen body which bears his wounds and yet is no longer subject to death.

Crucially, Augustine rejects any eschatology that dissolves the heavenly city into the progress of the earthly city. He writes after Rome’s sack, facing claims that Christianity has failed politically. His response is to double down on an eschatology that is both transcendent and future, while still affirming a genuine, though penultimate, good in creaturely and civic life. This Augustinian structure is essential for resisting modern political theologies that identify the kingdom with particular regimes, revolutions, or cultural projects. At the same time, Augustine’s emphasis on the soul’s immediate presence with Christ after death can be misread as endorsing a spiritualized final state. To answer this, one must distinguish his concession to pastoral urgency, comforting the dying with the hope of being with Christ, from his doctrinal insistence that this intermediate state is not our telos. The telos is the resurrection of the body and the beatific vision within a renewed creation, though Augustine’s own language about the “heavenly” life can sometimes obscure the spatial and cosmic dimensions.

Thomas Aquinas receives Augustine yet clarifies and sharpens several points that matter for doctrinal precision. In the Supplement to the Summa Theologiae, drawing on earlier material and the Sentences, Aquinas offers one of the most careful accounts of the **resurrection body**. For him, humans are essentially rational animals: a complete human is a composite of soul and body. Hence a purely spiritual final state would be a deficient mode of human existence. The resurrection is required by the integrity of human nature and by justice: the body that shared in the acts of virtue or vice must share in reward or punishment. He develops the classic “qualities of the glorified body” such as impassibility, subtlety, agility, and clarity. Even if one does not follow all these as dogmatic, they capture his central commitment that the glorified body is profoundly transformed, yet numerically identical, under the **divine omnipotence** that preserves identity through change.

Here an internal debate emerges within the wider Christian tradition: how strong is the metaphysical continuity between the present cosmos and the new creation? Aquinas leans toward a robust purification model: the elements will be transformed and perfected but not annihilated. Fire, as a symbol of purgation, figures prominently. Yet later scholastics and some modern theologians posit more radical breaks. A Reformed examiner may press: does this scholastic emphasis on continuity risk minimizing the apocalyptic newness of the coming age? The best way to integrate Aquinas with biblical apocalyptic is through the category of **eschatological judgment**. The same creation that now groans will be set free by a purifying judgment that is both destructive of evil and preservative of the good. Aquinas gives metaphysical tools for thinking this through, while Scripture governs the ultimate pattern.

Herman Bavinck, representing the Reformed confessional tradition, is crucial because he unites Irenaean, Augustinian, and scholastic strands with a rich doctrine of **covenant** and **union with Christ**, and because he consistently resists both dualism and immanentism. In Reformed Dogmatics, especially volumes 3 and 4, Bavinck insists that grace does not destroy nature but restores and perfects it. This axiom reaches its climax in his doctrine of new creation. He argues that the eschaton is not a second, completely different creation, but the consummation of this creation in fellowship with God. The resurrection of Christ is not only forensic vindication but the ontological beginning of that consummation. Christ rises as the last Adam, the **head of the new humanity**, and in him the destiny of the cosmos is already present.

Within the Reformed tradition, internal debates proliferate around millennial views, the nature of the intermediate state, and the scope of cosmic renewal. Bavinck navigates between two extremes. On one side lies a spiritualizing pietism that treats heaven as escape from the material world and thus marginalizes the doctrine of the body and the earth. On the other lies a postmillennial or triumphalist cultural program that identifies the kingdom with Christianized civilization. Bavinck rejects both. The kingdom comes by the sovereign act of God at the parousia, not by human achievement. At the same time, the present work of believers in culture, science, and art is not meaningless, for in some transfigured way it is caught up into the glory of the new creation. His language that “nothing true, good, or beautiful will be lost” must be carefully qualified: he does not mean unpurified cultural products will reappear in the eschaton, but that the creaturely capacities they express will find their consummate and pure expression. When examiners ask whether we will literally see specific cultural artifacts in the new creation, a Bavinckian answer is to dodge speculative detail while affirming that the eschaton will not be a blank slate but the redeemed fulfillment of creaturely life.

N. T. Wright functions as a contemporary figure whose work has both corrected distortions and raised concerns. In The Resurrection of the Son of God and Surprised by Hope, he argues historically for the physicality and objectivity of Christ’s resurrection and exegetically for a renewed-earth eschatology against popular “going to heaven when you die” narratives. His stress that the New Testament hope is resurrection, not disembodied immortality, has been salutary and has re-centered the theme of **new creation** in popular and scholarly discourse. Wright presses the continuity of God’s purposes from creation to consummation, reading Romans 8 and 1 Corinthians 15 as affirming not only the rescue of individuals but the liberation of the entire creation from its bondage to decay.

Yet Wright also illustrates contemporary internal debates among evangelicals and within Reformed circles about the relation of resurrection hope to present mission. His often reiterated line that “what you do in the present, by the power of the Spirit, will last into God’s future” can be read in a Bavinckian sense of principial continuity, or in a more activist register that risks downplaying the finality and sheer newness of the last day. Examiners may ask whether Wright’s inaugurated eschatology shades into over-realized eschatology. The critical point is to affirm with Wright that the resurrection power of Christ is already at work in the church through the Spirit, creating anticipatory signs of the kingdom, while also insisting that the full **new creation** is not the gradual accumulation of such signs but a climactic event at Christ’s return, accompanied by universal resurrection and judgment. A confessional Reformed stance will therefore receive Wright’s historical case for resurrection and his insistence on bodily and earthly hope, while resisting any flattening of the eschatological horizon into present social projects.

Bringing these figures into a single doctrinal construction requires clarifying what we mean by resurrection and new creation. Theologically, resurrection is not merely the reanimation of corpses but the divinely effected passage of the whole human person, body and soul, from death into an incorruptible mode of embodied life, patterned after and grounded in Christ’s own risen life. For believers, it is resurrection to glory and communion; for the wicked, to judgment and destruction. New creation is the comprehensive transformation of the entire created order through the final advent of Christ such that sin, death, and curse are removed, the dwelling of God with his people is unbroken, and the telos of **Sabbath rest** is realized. It is not the replacement of this world with an entirely other one, but the renewal, deliverance, and glorification of this world under the lordship of the crucified and risen Christ.

Several external debates have constantly shaped the doctrine. First is the ancient struggle against Gnosticism and more general Platonizing tendencies. Irenaeus and Augustine combat the denigration of matter and the idea that salvation is escape for the inner self from bodily existence. The church’s confession of the **resurrection of the body** stands as a permanent rejection of any anthropology or eschatology that treats the body as expendable. Yet one must also resist a crude materialism. Christian hope is not mere endless prolongation of current biological processes but entry into a qualitatively new, Spirit-empowered life. The resurrection body is **spiritual** in Paul’s sense: dominated and vivified by the Spirit, not composed of spirit-stuff. This distinction guards us from both gnostic disembodiment and secular naturalism.

Second is the challenge of Enlightenment naturalism and modern demythologization. From Reimarus through Bultmann, the historical facticity of Christ’s resurrection has been denied or reinterpreted as myth or existential symbol. If one grants this, both resurrection and new creation become essentially projections of human meaning. Against this, the figures we have considered, especially Wright in contemporary form, insist that the gospel stands or falls with the empty tomb and the real raising of Jesus in history. My defended position is frankly supernaturalist: the same **triune God** who created ex nihilo and governs providence intervened in history to raise Jesus, and this event is proleptic of the eschatological transformation of the cosmos. Demythologized reinterpretations cannot sustain the New Testament’s covenantal and forensic logic, where resurrection is God’s verdict on Jesus and the ground of justification, nor its cosmic logic, where resurrection is the firstfruits of the harvest of the dead and the pledge of a renewed creation.

Third is liberal realized eschatology and its political variants. Thinkers influenced by Ritschl, or later political theologians, have often identified the kingdom of God primarily with moral improvement, social justice, or communal solidarity. In such accounts, “resurrection” becomes a metaphor for the community’s continuing life or for historical progress. The doctrinal cost is enormous. Without a real future **new creation**, there is no final rectification of history, no ultimate answer to irreparable wrongs, no victory over death as such. A Reformed, Westminster-oriented answer must insist that while Christian ethics and social concern are nonoptional fruits of union with the risen Christ, they are not the kingdom in its fullness, and they cannot substitute for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come.

Within the church, several internal debates must be faced carefully. One concerns the continuity and discontinuity between present and future creation. Irenaeus, Augustine, Aquinas, Bavinck, and Wright all affirm real continuity: it is this creation, these bodies, this earth that God renews. Yet they also affirm decisive discontinuity by way of judgment, purgation, and glorification. Eschatological images of cosmic fire and shaking signal not the destruction of being, but of evil. One must articulate a doctrine of **purified continuity**: the ontological structures and identity of creatures endure, while the moral and physical corruptions of sin and death are removed. When examiners ask whether the language of “new heavens and new earth” in Isaiah and Revelation teaches replacement or renewal, one can appeal to the parallel with the believer’s newness in 2 Corinthians 5: the person is the same, yet new in relation, orientation, and destiny. The same pattern applies cosmically.

A second internal debate is the structure of the millennium. While not central to the dogmatic content of resurrection and new creation, millennial views influence how one frames the relation between present and future. A confessional Reformed, amillennial or modestly inaugurated-eschatological stance will insist that the general resurrection, final judgment, and full new creation coincide with Christ’s visible return, not with an extended earthly golden age within ordinary history. This secures the radical eschatological character of new creation and avoids the confusion of cultural progress with eschatological fulfillment.

A third internal debate concerns the destiny of non-human creation. Bavinck and Wright, building on Romans 8, stress that the entire creation groans and will be set free. This suggests that both animate and inanimate creation share in the glory of the children of God. The tradition has often speculated about animals in the new creation. The safest path, consistent with classical theism and exegesis, is to affirm that non-human creation as a whole is renewed, with no death, curse, or futility, yet without dogmatizing on the continuity of individual animals. What matters theologically is that God’s purposes in creating a rich, diverse cosmos are not abandoned but brought to fullness. Contemporary ecological theologies sometimes seize on this to baptize environmentalism as the church’s central mission; here a Westminster candidate must distinguish between the legitimacy of stewarding creation now, as part of obedience and love of neighbor, and the uniquely eschatological work of God in the final **new creation**, which no human project can achieve.

Contemporary debates about universalism and annihilationism also touch resurrection and new creation. If all are finally saved, as some modern theologians contend, then resurrection becomes simply the doorway to universal reconciliation. Yet Scripture and the historic confessions teach a resurrection to life and a resurrection to judgment. The new creation is not a homogeneous, all-inclusive reality but a differentiated one, with the holy city and the outer darkness. At the same time, annihilationist proposals, which see the wicked as finally destroyed rather than eternally punished, raise questions about the scope of cosmic renewal and the meaning of “all things” being made new. Any position here must safeguard both the justice and goodness of God and the final, irreversible victory of Christ. The line I would defend is traditional: the resurrection of the wicked is as real and bodily as that of the righteous, but its end is shame, exclusion, and enduring destruction under divine wrath, while the new creation as the dwelling of righteousness is not coextensive with the entire resurrected order but is the perfected communion of God with his people and the liberated creation.

Finally, resurrection and new creation must be located within adjacent loci for coherent defense. **Christology** is decisive: only a truly divine and truly human mediator can, by his resurrection, inaugurate a new humanity and a renewed cosmos. A merely moral exemplar cannot secure this. **Soteriology** depends on resurrection: justification is through the risen Christ, and sanctification is participation in his resurrection power. **Ecclesiology** is affected: the church is the community of the age to come, the people already raised with Christ in a spiritual sense, awaiting the redemption of their bodies. **Anthropology** is clarified: humans are designed for embodied, social, and earthly life with God, not for a purely spiritual existence. And **doctrine of God** shapes the entire vision: only the **immutable**, **omnipotent**, **faithful** God who created all things can be trusted to raise the dead and renew creation; any weakening of classical theism undermines the credibility of such hope.

Thus, drawing together Irenaeus’s anti-gnostic recapitulation, Augustine’s articulation of the two cities and the bodily resurrection, Aquinas’s metaphysical account of the glorified body and purified cosmos, Bavinck’s Reformed synthesis of nature and grace in covenantal **new creation**, and Wright’s historical defense of Christ’s resurrection and renewed-earth hope, we may defend a robust, biblically and confessionally grounded doctrine: the resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits and pattern of a final, bodily resurrection and cosmic new creation in which this world is purged, transformed, and brought into everlasting communion with the triune God, under the visible reign of the risen Lord, to the glory of God and the joy of his people.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: resurrection is the divine act by which God raises human beings bodily from death into an incorruptible, Spirit-empowered life patterned after Christ; new creation is the comprehensive, eschatological renewal and glorification of this very cosmos, purged of sin, death, and curse, as the eternal dwelling of God with his people.
- Decisive figures: Irenaeus defends material creation and resurrection against Gnosticism through **recapitulation**; Augustine secures bodily resurrection and a transcendent yet future city of God; Aquinas clarifies the identity and qualities of the **glorified body** and the purgative renewal of the cosmos; Bavinck integrates resurrection and **new creation** into Reformed **covenant** and nature–grace theology; N. T. Wright historically defends Christ’s bodily resurrection and re-centers renewed-earth eschatology.
- Debates: internal – degree of continuity between present and new creation, millennial structure, nature of the resurrection body, scope of cosmic renewal; external – Gnostic and Platonist spiritualization, Enlightenment naturalism and demythologization, liberal realized eschatology; contemporary – ecological eschatologies, over-realized inaugurated eschatology, universalism and annihilationism, destiny of non-human creation.
- Defended position: Christ’s historical, bodily resurrection is the ontological firstfruits and covenantal guarantee of a future, corporate, bodily resurrection and cosmic **new creation** that is continuous with but radically transformed beyond the present order, received only by those united to Christ, and arriving climactically at his visible return, not through gradual human progress.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Is the new creation a replacement or renewal of this world? Answer: renewal through purifying judgment, preserving ontological continuity while eradicating sin and curse.
  - How is the resurrection body “the same” yet glorified? Answer: numerically the same body in substance, transformed in qualities by divine power into incorruptible, Spirit-ruled life.
  - Does emphasizing present kingdom work collapse eschatology into history? Answer: no, present obedience is an anticipatory sign, but the full **new creation** comes only by God’s climactic act at Christ’s return.
  - How do you respond to demythologizing accounts of resurrection? Answer: they cannot sustain the New Testament’s forensic, covenantal, and cosmic claims, which presuppose a real, historical raising of Jesus’ body by the triune God.
  - What is the destiny of non-human creation? Answer: the whole creation is liberated from futility and shares in the glory of God’s children, though Scripture does not warrant dogmatic claims about individual creatures’ continuity.
