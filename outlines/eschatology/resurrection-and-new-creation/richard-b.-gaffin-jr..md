# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on the **resurrection of Christ** and **new creation** has profoundly shaped contemporary understanding of **Pauline soteriology** and **eschatology**. Gaffin emphasizes the centrality of Christ’s resurrection as both the foundation and firstfruits of the believer’s participation in the **new creation**, highlighting the **eschatological** and **corporate** dimensions of salvation. His exegesis underscores the inseparability of **union with Christ**, the **Spirit**, and the inaugurated reality of the **age to come**.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event in the accomplishment of redemption, the beginning of the eschatological new creation." (Resurrection and Redemption, p. 135)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation (2006, 2nd ed. 2013)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Eschatological Inauguration**
    - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the **new creation** and the **age to come**.
    - The resurrection is not merely a reversal of death but the beginning of a transformed, glorified existence.
    - The eschatological age is already present in the resurrection, though not yet consummated.
    - Believers participate in this inaugurated reality through union with the risen Christ.
    - "The resurrection is the beginning of the new creation, not simply the resuscitation of the old." (Resurrection and Redemption, p. 129)

2. **Union with Christ in Resurrection**
    - **Union with Christ** is the central soteriological category for understanding the believer’s participation in resurrection life.
    - The benefits of salvation (justification, sanctification, glorification) flow from this union.
    - Believers are raised with Christ spiritually now, anticipating bodily resurrection.
    - The Spirit mediates this union, making believers partakers in Christ’s resurrection power.
    - "All the saving benefits are found in union with the resurrected Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight, p. 41)

3. **Resurrection and Justification**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the ground of the believer’s **justification**.
    - Justification is not only a legal declaration but also an eschatological verdict realized in Christ’s resurrection.
    - The resurrection vindicates Christ and, by union, his people.
    - The forensic and transformative aspects of justification are inseparable in Paul’s theology.
    - "Justification is essentially resurrection-justification, the verdict of the last day brought forward." (Resurrection and Redemption, p. 121)

4. **Pneumatology and New Creation**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the agent of new creation, applying the resurrection life of Christ to believers.
    - Pentecost marks the outpouring of resurrection life and the beginning of the new creation community.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is both the guarantee and foretaste of the consummated new creation.
    - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the resurrection and exaltation of Christ.
    - "The Spirit is the eschatological gift, the power of the resurrection at work in believers." (Perspectives on Pentecost, p. 20)

5. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - The resurrection establishes the **already/not yet** structure of redemptive history.
    - Believers experience inaugurated resurrection life now, awaiting its consummation at Christ’s return.
    - The tension between present possession and future fulfillment shapes Christian hope and ethics.
    - The church lives as the community of the new creation in the overlap of the ages.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the decisive event that brings the future into the present." (Resurrection and Redemption, p. 136)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has decisively shaped modern Reformed discussions of **resurrection**, **union with Christ**, and the **new creation**. His rigorous exegesis of Pauline texts has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, especially in the Westminster tradition. By emphasizing the eschatological and corporate dimensions of salvation, Gaffin has helped recover the centrality of resurrection for both doctrine and Christian life. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the structure of **redemptive history** and the application of Christ’s work to the church.
