# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a robust doctrine of the **resurrection of the body** and the **new creation** within the framework of **eschatology** and **Christian anthropology**. He maintained that the resurrection is both a restoration and a glorification of the human person, integrating **soul and body** in perfect harmony, and that the new creation consummates God's purposes for all of **creation** in the beatific vision.

- "The resurrection of the body will be the restoration of the substance of the body, and the soul will be united to the body as its form." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q79, A1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially Supplementum, Questions 75–99
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 79–97
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians 15 (Super I ad Corinthios)
- Compendium Theologiae, Chapters 151–163
- Resurrection (De Resurrectione), disputed questions

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as bodily and personal**
    - The resurrection involves the **reunion of soul and body** in their original unity.
    - The same numerical body that died will be raised, though transformed.
    - Personal identity is preserved through the continuity of the rational soul.
    - The resurrection is necessary for the full perfection of human nature.
    - "For since the soul is part of man’s body, it is not man unless the soul be united to the body." (Summa Theologiae, Suppl. Q79, A1)

2. **Glorification and incorruptibility of the resurrected body**
    - The resurrected body will be **incorruptible**, free from suffering and death.
    - Four gifts characterize the glorified body: **impassibility, subtlety, agility, and clarity**.
    - The body will be perfectly subject to the soul, reflecting its spiritual perfection.
    - This glorification is a participation in Christ’s own resurrection.
    - "The bodies of the risen will be of the same nature, but of different glory." (Summa Theologiae, Suppl. Q85, A1)

3. **Universality of resurrection**
    - All humans, both righteous and wicked, will be raised at the last day.
    - The resurrection is a divine act of justice and mercy, rewarding or punishing according to deeds.
    - The wicked will rise to **eternal punishment**, the righteous to **eternal life**.
    - The universality of resurrection upholds the justice of God in the final judgment.
    - "All men alike will rise again, but not all to the same end." (Summa Contra Gentiles IV, 86)

4. **New creation as cosmic renewal**
    - The new creation involves the **renewal of the entire cosmos**, not just humanity.
    - Creation will be freed from corruption and share in the glory of the children of God.
    - The new heavens and new earth will be the fitting context for resurrected life.
    - This cosmic renewal is the consummation of God’s providential order.
    - "The world itself will be renewed, so that it will correspond to the state of the risen saints." (Summa Theologiae, Suppl. Q91, A1)

5. **Beatific vision as the goal of resurrection and new creation**
    - The ultimate end of resurrection is the **beatific vision**—direct knowledge of God.
    - The resurrected body enables the soul to enjoy God in a fully human way.
    - The new creation is ordered to the perfect enjoyment of God by the blessed.
    - The beatific vision fulfills the deepest desires of both soul and body.
    - "Man’s ultimate happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence." (Summa Theologiae, I-II, Q3, A8)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of the **resurrection and new creation** shaped medieval and later Catholic eschatology, providing a systematic synthesis of biblical teaching and Aristotelian philosophy. His emphasis on the **integrity of the human person** and the cosmic scope of redemption influenced both scholastic and modern theological discussions. Aquinas’s careful distinctions regarding the nature of the resurrected body and the final state remain foundational for contemporary debates on eschatology and anthropology.
