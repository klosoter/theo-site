# Richard Bauckham (1946– )

Richard Bauckham’s work on **resurrection** and **new creation** emphasizes the centrality of Christ’s bodily resurrection as the inauguration of the eschatological renewal of all creation. He situates the resurrection within the broader biblical narrative, highlighting its role in fulfilling **Jewish eschatological hopes** and grounding the Christian vision of **cosmic restoration**. Bauckham’s approach integrates **biblical theology** with a strong focus on the continuity between the resurrection of Jesus and the promised **new heavens and new earth**.

## Legacy and Impact

Bauckham’s integration of **resurrection** and **new creation** has significantly shaped contemporary **biblical theology**, especially in connecting eschatology with ecological and cosmic concerns. His work has influenced both scholarly and ecclesial understandings of the resurrection as the foundation for Christian hope and mission. By rooting the Christian vision of renewal in both **Jewish apocalyptic** and the New Testament witness, Bauckham has provided a robust framework for understanding the scope of redemption. His emphasis on the continuity between creation and new creation continues to inform discussions on the relationship between theology, ethics, and the environment.
