# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge approached the doctrines of **resurrection** and **new creation** from a classic **Reformed** and **systematic theology** perspective, emphasizing the continuity between the present creation and its future renewal. He affirmed the **bodily resurrection** of believers and the ultimate restoration of the cosmos, rooted in the work of **Christ** and the promises of **Scripture**.

- "The resurrection of Christ is not only the pledge, but the cause of the resurrection of his people." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially Vol. 3, chapters on resurrection and eschatology)
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians (notably on 1 Corinthians 15)
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on resurrection themes)
- The Way of Life (sections on future hope and new creation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bodily Resurrection of Believers**
    - Resurrection is not merely spiritual but involves the actual **physical body**.
    - The same bodies that die will be raised, transformed, and glorified.
    - Resurrection is grounded in the resurrection of **Christ** as the "firstfruits."
    - The event is future, occurring at the **second coming**.
    - "The resurrection of the body is an essential part of the Christian system." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Continuity and Discontinuity in New Creation**
    - The new creation is a renewal, not an annihilation, of the present cosmos.
    - There is real continuity between the current and future creation, yet also transformation.
    - The effects of sin will be fully removed in the new creation.
    - The new heavens and new earth will be the eternal dwelling of the redeemed.
    - "The Scriptures teach not the annihilation, but the renovation of the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Union with Christ as the Basis for Resurrection**
    - Believers are united to Christ in his death and resurrection.
    - Christ’s resurrection guarantees the resurrection of all who are in him.
    - This union is both legal (justification) and vital (sanctification and glorification).
    - The benefits of Christ’s resurrection are applied to believers by the Holy Spirit.
    - "As Christ lives, so shall all who are united to Him by faith live also." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Scriptural Authority for Eschatological Hope**
    - Hodge grounds his doctrine in the authority of **Scripture** alone.
    - He interprets key passages (e.g., 1 Corinthians 15, Romans 8) as teaching bodily resurrection and cosmic renewal.
    - Rejects speculative or philosophical notions not rooted in biblical revelation.
    - Emphasizes the clarity and sufficiency of Scripture on these doctrines.
    - "Our faith in the resurrection rests on the plain declarations of the Word of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Resurrection and Final Judgment**
    - The resurrection is inseparably linked to the final judgment.
    - All humanity will be raised: the righteous to life, the wicked to condemnation.
    - The resurrection inaugurates the final state—either eternal life or eternal punishment.
    - The new creation is the context for the everlasting blessedness of the redeemed.
    - "The resurrection is immediately followed by the general judgment and the final state." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust articulation of the **bodily resurrection** and the **renewal of creation** shaped generations of Reformed theology, especially in the American context. His insistence on the authority of **Scripture** and the centrality of **union with Christ** provided a framework for later Princeton theologians and evangelical scholars. Hodge’s careful exegesis and systematic approach continue to influence discussions on eschatology and the Christian hope for new creation.
