# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of **resurrection** and **new creation** is rooted in his robust commitment to the **sovereignty of God**, the **union with Christ**, and the **eschatological renewal** of all things. He emphasizes that the resurrection is both a future hope and a present reality for believers, grounded in the work of Christ and the promise of **restoration** for both humanity and the cosmos. Calvin’s vision of the new creation is inseparable from his understanding of **redemption** and the consummation of God’s redemptive plan.

- "For as Christ rose once for all from the dead, so the power and efficacy of that resurrection is perpetual, and daily operates in believers." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 3.3.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 3, chapters 21–25)
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians (esp. ch. 15)
- Commentary on Romans (esp. ch. 8)
- Sermons on the Epistle to the Ephesians
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Central to Salvation**
    - The resurrection of Christ is the foundation and guarantee of believers’ own resurrection.
    - Resurrection is not merely spiritual but involves the **restoration of the body**.
    - Calvin ties resurrection to the believer’s **union with Christ**.
    - The resurrection is both a future event and a present spiritual reality.
    - "We must understand that as Christ’s resurrection is the pledge of our resurrection, so it is the cause of it." (Institutes, 3.25.3)

2. **Union with Christ in Resurrection**
    - Believers participate in Christ’s resurrection through spiritual union.
    - This union assures both present renewal and future bodily resurrection.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s resurrection to the elect.
    - Resurrection life begins now, transforming the believer’s existence.
    - "We are already raised to newness of life by participation in Christ." (Institutes, 3.3.1)

3. **New Creation as Cosmic Renewal**
    - The new creation encompasses not only redeemed humanity but the entire cosmos.
    - Calvin interprets passages like Romans 8 as teaching the liberation of creation itself.
    - The **restoration** of all things is a reversal of the effects of the Fall.
    - The new creation is inaugurated in Christ and awaits consummation.
    - "The restoration brought by Christ extends to the whole world." (Commentary on Romans 8:21)

4. **Eschatological Hope and Perseverance**
    - The promise of resurrection and new creation grounds Christian hope.
    - Calvin encourages perseverance in suffering by looking to future glory.
    - The resurrection assures believers of ultimate victory over death and sin.
    - Eschatological hope motivates present holiness and faithfulness.
    - "We must raise our minds to the resurrection, that we may not faint under the cross." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians 15:19)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in New Creation**
    - Calvin affirms both continuity and transformation between the present and future creation.
    - The resurrected body is the same yet gloriously renewed.
    - The world will be purified, not annihilated, in the new creation.
    - God’s original purpose for creation will be fulfilled in its renewal.
    - "God will restore the world to a better state, purging it from all corruption." (Commentary on 2 Peter 3:13)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s teaching on **resurrection** and **new creation** has profoundly shaped Reformed eschatology, emphasizing the holistic redemption of both humanity and the cosmos. His insistence on the centrality of **union with Christ** and the inaugurated reality of new creation continues to influence contemporary theology. Calvin’s balanced view of continuity and transformation in the new creation remains a touchstone for discussions on Christian hope and the future of creation.
