# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline’s theology of **resurrection** and **new creation** is rooted in his distinctive understanding of **covenant eschatology** and the **kingdom of God**. He emphasizes the pattern of **intrusion ethics** and the typological significance of historical events, viewing the resurrection as both the fulfillment of **redemptive history** and the inauguration of the **consummate new creation**. Kline’s approach highlights the continuity and escalation from the original creation to the eschatological reality secured in Christ.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits of the new creation, the definitive intrusion of the age to come into the present order." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Images of the Spirit
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Structure of Biblical Authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology Embedded in Creation**
   - The original creation order was inherently eschatological, pointing toward a consummated state.
   - Adam’s probation in Eden prefigured the hope of **glorification** and **resurrection life**.
   - The Sabbath rest was a sign of the ultimate **new creation** rest.
   - The fall delayed but did not abolish the eschatological goal.
   - "The movement from creation to consummation is the underlying drama of biblical history." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Intrusion Ethics and Typology**
   - Historical events in redemptive history serve as intrusions of the final judgment and new creation.
   - The resurrection of Christ is the supreme intrusion of the age to come.
   - Typological judgments (e.g., the flood, conquest) prefigure the final renewal.
   - The church participates in the powers of the age to come through union with Christ.
   - "Redemptive acts are intrusions of the eschaton into the present world order." (Images of the Spirit)

3. **Covenant and Kingdom Structure**
   - The **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** both point toward eschatological fulfillment.
   - Christ as the second Adam secures the resurrection and new creation for his people.
   - The kingdom of God is both inaugurated and consummated through resurrection.
   - The new creation is the realized kingdom, established by covenantal fidelity.
   - "The kingdom consummation is the telos of all covenantal history." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

4. **Christ’s Resurrection as Firstfruits**
   - Christ’s resurrection is the guarantee and pattern of the believer’s resurrection.
   - The resurrection marks the beginning of the new creation in history.
   - Believers are united to Christ’s resurrection life by the Spirit.
   - The church’s hope is grounded in Christ’s victory over death.
   - "Christ’s resurrection is the definitive firstfruits of the new creation order." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Sacramental Signs and Eschatological Realities**
   - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper signify participation in the resurrection and new creation.
   - Sacraments are covenantal oaths that anticipate eschatological fulfillment.
   - The Spirit’s presence in the sacraments is a foretaste of the new creation.
   - The church’s worship is an anticipation of the consummate kingdom.
   - "The sacraments are signs and seals of the eschatological inheritance." (By Oath Consigned)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s robust **biblical-theological** approach has shaped Reformed discussions of **resurrection** and **new creation**, especially through his emphasis on typology and covenantal structure. His influence is evident in the development of modern covenant theology and in the work of his students and interpreters. Kline’s integration of eschatology with creation and redemption continues to inform contemporary debates on the unity of Scripture and the hope of the church. His legacy endures in the ongoing exploration of the relationship between the historical and the eschatological in Reformed theology.
