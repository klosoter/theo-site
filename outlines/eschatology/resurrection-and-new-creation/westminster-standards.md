# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a robust doctrine of the **resurrection** and **new creation** within the framework of **Reformed eschatology**. They emphasize the bodily resurrection of both the just and unjust, the transformation of the cosmos, and the consummation of **redemptive history** in the eternal state, all grounded in the work of **Christ** as the firstfruits of the resurrection.

- "At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed: and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other, although with different qualities, which shall be united again to their souls forever." (Westminster Confession of Faith 32.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapters 32 ("Of the State of Men after Death, and of the Resurrection of the Dead") and 33 ("Of the Last Judgment")
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 84–90, 87–90 (on resurrection and the last things)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 37–38 (on benefits at death and at resurrection)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (attached to the Standards in some editions)
- Standard commentaries: A.A. Hodge, "The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bodily Resurrection of All Humanity**
    - Both the righteous and the wicked will be raised bodily at the last day.
    - The same bodies that die will be raised, though transformed with new qualities.
    - The resurrection is not merely spiritual but involves the **physical restoration** of the body.
    - The resurrection is grounded in the resurrection of **Christ** as the firstfruits.
    - "All the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other, although with different qualities, which shall be united again to their souls forever." (WCF 32.2)

2. **Transformation and Glorification of the Saints**
    - The righteous will be raised to **everlasting life** and glory.
    - Their bodies will be made incorruptible and conformed to Christ’s glorious body.
    - The transformation includes freedom from sin, suffering, and death.
    - This glorification is the final benefit of union with Christ.
    - "The bodies of the just, by His Spirit, unto honour, and be made conformable to His own glorious body." (WLC 87)

3. **Judgment and the Twofold Destiny**
    - After the resurrection, all will appear before the **judgment seat of Christ**.
    - The righteous will enter into **eternal blessedness** in the new creation.
    - The wicked will be consigned to everlasting punishment.
    - The resurrection thus inaugurates the final and irreversible state of all people.
    - "The wicked shall be cast into eternal torments, and the righteous into everlasting life." (WSC 38)

4. **Renewal of Creation**
    - The **new creation** involves not only redeemed humanity but also the renewal of the cosmos.
    - The present world will be purged and transformed, not annihilated.
    - The new heavens and new earth will be the eternal dwelling place of the redeemed.
    - This cosmic renewal is the consummation of God’s redemptive purpose.
    - "God will make all things new, both in heaven and earth." (WLC 90)

5. **Christ as the Firstfruits and Pattern**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the guarantee and pattern for the resurrection of believers.
    - Union with Christ ensures participation in His resurrection life.
    - The resurrection is a central aspect of the **ordo salutis** and eschatological hope.
    - The new creation is realized in and through the exalted Christ.
    - "Christ is risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept." (WLC 52)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped **Reformed eschatology**, providing a systematic and biblically grounded account of the resurrection and new creation. Their articulation of the bodily resurrection, cosmic renewal, and the centrality of Christ’s work remains foundational for Presbyterian and broader Reformed theology. The Standards’ influence endures in confessional churches, catechetical instruction, and ongoing theological reflection on the hope of **new creation**.
