# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl approached the **resurrection** and **new creation** primarily through the lens of the **kingdom of God** and the ethical transformation of the community. He emphasized the significance of the resurrection not as a supernatural event to be proven, but as the foundation for the **moral renewal** and **communal life** of believers, which he saw as the true manifestation of the new creation. For Ritschl, the resurrection's value lies in its power to generate faith and foster the **ethical community** that embodies the kingdom.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the presupposition of the Christian community and its faith." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- Justification and Reconciliation (Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung)
- The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation (English translation)
- Instruction in the Christian Religion (Unterricht in der christlichen Religion)
- Theology and Metaphysics (Theologie und Metaphysik)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Foundation of the Community**
    - The resurrection is essential for the existence and faith of the Christian community.
    - It is not primarily a historical fact to be demonstrated, but a theological presupposition.
    - The event's significance is found in its power to inspire and sustain communal life.
    - The resurrection undergirds the ongoing reality of the **kingdom of God**.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the presupposition of the Christian community and its faith." (Justification and Reconciliation)

2. **Ethical Renewal as New Creation**
    - The new creation is realized in the ethical transformation of individuals and communities.
    - Ritschl rejects speculative metaphysics in favor of practical, moral outcomes.
    - The resurrection's meaning is seen in the renewal of life and relationships.
    - The **kingdom of God** is the sphere where new creation is manifest in love and service.
    - "The new creation is the ethical community which realizes the kingdom of God." (Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Kingdom of God as Central Motif**
    - The kingdom is the organizing principle of Christian doctrine and life.
    - Resurrection and new creation are interpreted through the kingdom's ethical demands.
    - The church is the visible form of the kingdom and the locus of new creation.
    - The kingdom is not future or otherworldly, but present in the moral life of believers.
    - "The kingdom of God is the highest good, realized in the community of love." (Justification and Reconciliation)

4. **Rejection of Metaphysical Speculation**
    - Ritschl distances theology from metaphysical or speculative accounts of resurrection.
    - He insists on the practical, historical, and communal dimensions of Christian hope.
    - Theological claims must be grounded in the experience and life of the community.
    - The resurrection is affirmed for its religious value, not as a metaphysical miracle.
    - "We must not seek the meaning of the resurrection in metaphysical speculation, but in its value for faith." (Justification and Reconciliation)

5. **Faith and Value-Judgment**
    - Faith is a value-judgment rooted in the experience of the community.
    - The resurrection is meaningful as it evokes trust and commitment to the kingdom.
    - Doctrines are justified by their capacity to promote the ethical life.
    - The new creation is experienced as the transformation of values and relationships.
    - "Faith is a value-judgment which finds its object in the community founded by Christ." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s approach to **resurrection** and **new creation** shifted the focus from metaphysical speculation to the ethical and communal dimensions of Christian faith. His emphasis on the **kingdom of God** as the locus of new creation influenced later liberal theology and the development of social gospel movements. While criticized for downplaying supernatural elements, Ritschl’s work remains significant for its insistence on the practical and communal realization of Christian hope. His legacy endures in discussions of the ethical implications of resurrection and the nature of the church as the new creation.
