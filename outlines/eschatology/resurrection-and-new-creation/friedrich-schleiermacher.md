# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the **resurrection** and **new creation** through the lens of **God-consciousness** and the transformative power of **religious experience**. He reinterpreted traditional doctrines, emphasizing the symbolic and existential significance of **Christ’s resurrection** as the foundation for the renewal of human consciousness and the emergence of a new ethical community.

- "The influence of Christ upon his community is, in fact, the communication of his self-consciousness, which is the divine life itself." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Spiritual Transformation**
    - The resurrection is primarily understood as the awakening of **God-consciousness** within the community.
    - Emphasizes the ongoing presence of Christ in the church rather than a physical event.
    - Views resurrection as the foundation for the renewal of ethical life.
    - Connects resurrection to the transformative power of religious experience.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is not a single fact to be believed, but the expression of the new life which has arisen in the community." (The Christian Faith)

2. **New Creation as Ethical Community**
    - The new creation is realized in the formation of a community shaped by Christ’s consciousness.
    - Ethical transformation is central to the idea of new creation.
    - The church embodies the new creation through its shared spiritual life.
    - The new creation is not a future event but a present reality in the community.
    - "The new creation is the fellowship of those who share in the divine life revealed in Christ." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Christ’s Resurrection as Paradigm of Human Destiny**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the archetype for the destiny of all humanity.
    - It signifies the possibility of overcoming alienation from God.
    - Human participation in Christ’s resurrection is through spiritual union, not physical imitation.
    - The resurrection points to the ultimate fulfillment of human nature in God.
    - "In Christ, the divine and human are united, and in his resurrection, we see the destiny of humanity." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Continuity of Creation and Redemption**
    - Creation and redemption are not separate acts but aspects of the same divine process.
    - The new creation is the culmination of God’s ongoing creative activity.
    - Redemption is understood as the restoration and fulfillment of creation.
    - The resurrection is the sign of God’s faithfulness to creation.
    - "Redemption is the completion of creation, and the resurrection is its pledge." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Symbolic Interpretation of Eschatology**
    - Eschatological language is interpreted symbolically, not literally.
    - Resurrection and new creation point to inner transformation, not external events.
    - The hope of new creation inspires ethical living in the present.
    - The ultimate goal is the realization of the kingdom of God within the community.
    - "The future life is the eternal continuation of the God-consciousness awakened in us by Christ." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **resurrection** and **new creation** profoundly shaped modern theology, shifting focus from metaphysical speculation to the **transformative experience** of the Christian community. His emphasis on the ethical and communal dimensions of these doctrines influenced later liberal and existential theologians. While his symbolic approach was controversial, it opened new avenues for understanding the relevance of resurrection and new creation in contemporary faith and practice.
