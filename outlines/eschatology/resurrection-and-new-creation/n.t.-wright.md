# N.T. Wright (1948–)

N.T. Wright is a leading voice in contemporary **New Testament scholarship**, emphasizing the **bodily resurrection** of Jesus as the cornerstone of Christian hope and the inauguration of **new creation**. He argues that the resurrection is not merely about individual afterlife but signals the renewal of the entire cosmos, integrating **eschatology** with the mission of the church in the present world.

- "The resurrection is not an isolated supernatural oddity proving how powerful God is, but it is the decisive event demonstrating that the creator God has launched his new creation in the midst of the old." (Surprised by Hope)

## Legacy and Impact
