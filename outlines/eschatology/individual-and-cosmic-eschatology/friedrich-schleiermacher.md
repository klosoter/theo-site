# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **individual and cosmic eschatology** through the lens of **religious consciousness** and the **feeling of absolute dependence**. He downplayed traditional doctrines of **resurrection**, **final judgment**, and **apocalyptic expectation**, instead emphasizing the ongoing realization of the **kingdom of God** within the community and the individual's union with the divine.

- "The immortality of the soul is not a doctrine of the church, but only a philosophical opinion." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Religious Consciousness**
   - Eschatological hope is rooted in the transformation of the individual's **God-consciousness**.
   - The **feeling of absolute dependence** shapes expectations about the future.
   - Traditional apocalyptic imagery is reinterpreted as symbolic of spiritual realities.
   - The focus is on the present experience of redemption rather than future events.
   - "All that is future is only the unfolding of what is already present in the religious self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Immortality Redefined**
   - Rejects the notion of personal immortality as a dogmatic certainty.
   - Immortality is the persistence of the individual's participation in the divine life.
   - The soul's destiny is not individual survival but union with God.
   - Resurrection is interpreted metaphorically, not as bodily continuation.
   - "The doctrine of immortality is not a part of Christian faith." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Kingdom of God as Ethical Community**
   - The **kingdom of God** is realized in the ethical life of the Christian community.
   - Cosmic fulfillment is the spread of God-consciousness among humanity.
   - Eschatology is the progressive actualization of divine purpose in history.
   - The church is the locus of eschatological hope, not a future event.
   - "The kingdom of God is the highest good, realized in the community of believers." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Minimizing Apocalyptic Expectation**
   - Apocalyptic language is seen as mythological and non-essential.
   - Final judgment is interpreted as the self-realization of one's relationship to God.
   - Cosmic eschatology is subsumed under the development of religious consciousness.
   - The end of history is not a cataclysm but the culmination of spiritual development.
   - "The end of the world is the completion of the kingdom of God." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Christ as the Eschatological Fulfillment**
   - Christ embodies the perfect **God-consciousness** and is the model for humanity.
   - The work of Christ inaugurates the eschatological age in the present.
   - Individual and cosmic fulfillment are united in the person and work of Christ.
   - Eschatology is realized through participation in Christ's life, not future events.
   - "In Christ, the divine and human are perfectly united, and in Him the end is already present." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **individual and cosmic eschatology** profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology by shifting the focus from external, future events to the internal, communal realization of redemption. His reinterpretation of **immortality**, **final judgment**, and the **kingdom of God** laid the groundwork for later liberal and existentialist theologians. While criticized for minimizing traditional doctrines, his emphasis on religious experience and ethical community remains a significant reference point in contemporary discussions of eschatology.
