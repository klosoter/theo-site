# N. T. Wright (1948– )

N. T. Wright approaches **individual and cosmic eschatology** through the lens of **resurrection**, **new creation**, and the inaugurated-yet-future **kingdom of God**. He emphasizes the continuity between the present world and its ultimate renewal, rejecting both escapist and purely spiritualized views of the afterlife in favor of a robust, bodily **resurrection** and the transformation of all creation.

- "God’s plan is not to abandon this world, the world which he said was ‘very good.’ Rather, he intends to remake it." (Surprised by Hope)

## Key Works

- Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church
- The Resurrection of the Son of God (Christian Origins and the Question of God, Vol. 3)
- Paul and the Faithfulness of God
- Simply Christian: Why Christianity Makes Sense
- Evil and the Justice of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bodily Resurrection as Central Hope**
    - Argues that **resurrection** is not mere survival of the soul, but the transformation of the whole person.
    - Stresses the physicality of the resurrection body, modeled after Christ’s own resurrection.
    - Rejects Platonic dualism in favor of a **biblical anthropology**.
    - Connects individual resurrection to the renewal of the entire cosmos.
    - "The early Christians did not simply believe in life after death; they virtually never spoke simply of going to heaven when they died." (Surprised by Hope)

2. **New Creation and Cosmic Renewal**
    - Sees **cosmic eschatology** as the restoration and transformation of the entire created order.
    - Emphasizes the continuity between the present creation and the new creation.
    - Interprets biblical prophecy as pointing to the renewal, not the destruction, of the world.
    - Links the resurrection of Jesus as the firstfruits of the coming new creation.
    - "The point of the resurrection… is that the present bodily life is not valueless just because it will die." (Surprised by Hope)

3. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
    - Argues that the **kingdom of God** was inaugurated in Jesus’ ministry, death, and resurrection.
    - Maintains that the fullness of the kingdom awaits future consummation.
    - Stresses the “already/not yet” tension in New Testament eschatology.
    - Encourages Christians to participate in God’s ongoing work of renewal.
    - "Jesus’s resurrection is the beginning of God’s new project not to snatch people away from earth but to colonize earth with the life of heaven." (Surprised by Hope)

4. **Judgment and Justice**
    - Affirms a future, public **judgment** as essential to biblical eschatology.
    - Connects judgment with the setting right of all things, not merely retribution.
    - Sees God’s justice as restorative, aiming at the renewal of creation.
    - Insists that judgment is necessary for true hope and moral seriousness.
    - "God’s justice is not simply retributive, but restorative and transformative." (Evil and the Justice of God)

5. **Mission and Eschatological Ethics**
    - Argues that belief in **resurrection** and new creation shapes Christian mission and ethics.
    - Rejects escapist or world-denying attitudes in favor of active engagement.
    - Encourages the church to anticipate and embody the coming kingdom in the present.
    - Sees ethical living as a sign and foretaste of the ultimate renewal.
    - "What you do in the present—by painting, preaching, singing, sewing, praying, teaching…—will last into God’s future." (Surprised by Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

N. T. Wright has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **eschatology** by re-centering the biblical vision of resurrection and new creation. His work has challenged both traditional and popular misconceptions about heaven, afterlife, and the destiny of creation. Wright’s emphasis on the **kingdom of God** and inaugurated eschatology has influenced both academic theology and the practical mission of the church, encouraging a holistic engagement with the world in light of God’s promised future.
