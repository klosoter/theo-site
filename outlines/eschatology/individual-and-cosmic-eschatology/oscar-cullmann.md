# Oscar Cullmann (1902–1999)

Oscar Cullmann was a pivotal figure in 20th-century theology, especially known for his distinctive approach to **eschatology**. He emphasized the **already/not yet** tension in **salvation history**, arguing that both **individual** and **cosmic eschatology** are best understood through the lens of Christ’s redemptive work as the decisive midpoint in history. Cullmann rejected both realized eschatology and extreme futurism, insisting on the ongoing significance of **resurrection** and the ultimate consummation of all things.

- "The Christ-event is the midpoint of time, but not its end." ("Christ and Time")

## Key Works

- Christ and Time: The Primitive Christian Conception of Time and History
- Salvation in History
- Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?
- The Christology of the New Testament
- Essays on the Lord’s Supper

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Salvation History**
    - Views **eschatology** as unfolding within the linear progression of **salvation history**.
    - Christ’s death and resurrection are the central, decisive events, but not the final consummation.
    - The present age is marked by tension between what has been inaugurated and what is yet to come.
    - History is meaningful and directed toward a divine goal.
    - "The New Testament sees the Christ-event as the midpoint, not the end, of history." (Christ and Time)

2. **Already/Not Yet Tension**
    - The kingdom of God is both present and future, inaugurated but not fulfilled.
    - Believers experience the benefits of salvation now, but await final realization.
    - This tension shapes both **individual** and **cosmic eschatology**.
    - Rejects both over-realized and under-realized eschatological schemes.
    - "The Christian lives between D-Day and V-Day." (Christ and Time)

3. **Resurrection over Immortality of the Soul**
    - Argues for the primacy of **bodily resurrection** rather than the Greek idea of the soul’s immortality.
    - Resurrection is both an individual and cosmic event, tied to Christ’s own resurrection.
    - The hope of the believer is not escape from the world, but transformation of the whole person.
    - This view underscores the future, bodily dimension of Christian hope.
    - "The immortality of the soul is not a biblical concept; the resurrection of the dead is." (Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?)

4. **Cosmic Dimension of Redemption**
    - Eschatology concerns not only individuals but the renewal of the entire creation.
    - Christ’s work has cosmic implications, pointing to the restoration of all things.
    - The final consummation involves the defeat of all evil and the renewal of the cosmos.
    - The church participates in this cosmic drama, anticipating the new creation.
    - "Redemption is not only for man but for the whole cosmos." (Salvation in History)

5. **Historical Revelation and Expectation**
    - God’s acts in history are progressive and culminate in Christ, but history continues toward fulfillment.
    - The Christian hope is anchored in historical events, not abstract ideas.
    - The future is genuinely open, awaiting God’s final act.
    - Eschatological expectation is rooted in the reliability of God’s past actions.
    - "The Christian faith is a faith in historical revelation and in historical expectation." (Christ and Time)

## Legacy and Impact

Cullmann’s emphasis on **salvation history** and the **already/not yet** framework has profoundly shaped modern discussions of eschatology. His critique of the immortality of the soul and focus on **resurrection** have influenced both biblical scholarship and systematic theology. By situating both individual and cosmic eschatology within the ongoing narrative of redemption, Cullmann provided a robust alternative to existentialist and purely future-oriented eschatologies. His work remains foundational for understanding the interplay between history, Christology, and eschatological hope.
