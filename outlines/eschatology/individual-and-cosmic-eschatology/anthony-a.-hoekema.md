# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema advanced a robustly **Reformed eschatology** that integrates both **individual** and **cosmic eschatology** within the framework of **inaugurated eschatology**. He emphasized the unity of **personal destiny** (death, intermediate state, resurrection) and the **renewal of creation**, rejecting both spiritualized and purely futurist interpretations of the **kingdom of God**.

- "Biblical eschatology is concerned not only with the destiny of the individual but also with the destiny of the cosmos." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Key Works

- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- Created in God’s Image (1986)
- "Amillennialism" in The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views (1977)
- "The Reformed Perspective" in The Millennium: Four Views (1977)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
   - The **kingdom of God** is both "already" present and "not yet" consummated.
   - Believers experience the firstfruits of **eschatological blessings** now.
   - The tension between present reality and future fulfillment shapes all eschatological hope.
   - This framework unites individual and cosmic aspects of redemption.
   - "The kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope." (The Bible and the Future)

2. **Unity of Individual and Cosmic Eschatology**
   - Personal destiny (death, intermediate state, resurrection) is inseparable from the renewal of creation.
   - The **resurrection of the body** is central to both individual and cosmic hope.
   - The final state involves both perfected persons and a renewed cosmos.
   - Redemption is holistic, affecting all of creation, not just souls.
   - "The final destiny of the redeemed is not a disembodied existence, but life in a renewed universe." (The Bible and the Future)

3. **Rejection of Premillennialism**
   - Hoekema defends **amillennialism** as the most biblically faithful view.
   - He critiques the idea of a literal, earthly millennium after Christ’s return.
   - The millennium is understood as the present reign of Christ and the saints.
   - The second coming brings the final judgment and the new creation, not a temporary kingdom.
   - "The millennium is the present reign of the souls of deceased believers with Christ in heaven." (The Bible and the Future)

4. **Intermediate State**
   - After death, believers are consciously with Christ, awaiting bodily resurrection.
   - The intermediate state is a temporary, blessed existence, not the final goal.
   - There is no purgatory or soul sleep; personal identity is preserved.
   - The focus remains on the resurrection and the new earth, not on the intermediate state.
   - "The intermediate state is a provisional period of conscious existence with Christ." (The Bible and the Future)

5. **Cosmic Renewal, Not Annihilation**
   - The **new earth** is a renewal and transformation of the present creation, not its replacement.
   - God’s redemptive purpose includes the entire cosmos, reversing the effects of the fall.
   - The continuity between the present world and the new creation affirms the goodness of creation.
   - The final state is physical, communal, and gloriously restored.
   - "The new earth will be this earth, cleansed by fire and gloriously renewed." (The Bible and the Future)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s synthesis of **individual and cosmic eschatology** has become foundational in contemporary Reformed theology. His articulation of **inaugurated eschatology** and defense of amillennialism have shaped evangelical and Reformed discussions on the end times. By emphasizing the renewal of creation and the bodily resurrection, Hoekema helped recover a holistic biblical hope that resists both spiritualizing and escapist tendencies. His work continues to influence systematic theology, biblical studies, and Christian worldview formation.
