# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s approach to **individual and cosmic eschatology** is marked by a sober, Scripture-centered restraint, emphasizing the certainty of **resurrection**, **final judgment**, and the renewal of all things in Christ. He stresses the intermediate state of the soul after death, the ultimate **restoration of creation**, and the consummation of God’s redemptive plan in the **new heavens and new earth**. Calvin avoids speculative detail, focusing instead on the believer’s union with Christ and the assurance of eternal life.

- "We must hold, as has already been stated and will be explained more fully hereafter, that the souls of the pious, after leaving the body, live with the Lord." (Institutes 3.25.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 3, chapters 24–25)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on 1 Corinthians (esp. ch. 15)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on 1 Thessalonians (esp. ch. 4–5)
- Sermons on 2 Timothy (esp. 2 Tim 4:6–8)
- Theological Treatises (e.g., Psychopannychia)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Intermediate State of the Soul**
    - The souls of believers are immediately taken into the presence of Christ at death.
    - There is conscious fellowship with Christ prior to the resurrection.
    - Calvin rejects the doctrine of soul sleep (psychopannychia).
    - The wicked experience a foretaste of judgment even before the final resurrection.
    - "The souls of the pious, after leaving the body, live with the Lord." (Institutes 3.25.6)

2. **Bodily Resurrection**
    - The resurrection of the body is central to Christian hope.
    - Both the righteous and the wicked will be raised, but to different ends.
    - The resurrection is grounded in union with Christ, the firstfruits.
    - The body will be transformed, not annihilated or replaced.
    - "Christ rose again that he might make us partakers of the resurrection." (Institutes 3.25.3)

3. **Final Judgment**
    - Christ will return to judge the living and the dead.
    - The righteous will be vindicated and the wicked condemned.
    - Judgment is based on faith in Christ, evidenced by works.
    - The final judgment brings the full manifestation of God’s justice and mercy.
    - "All must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, to render an account for every word and deed." (Institutes 3.25.1)

4. **Renewal of Creation**
    - The entire cosmos will be liberated from corruption and futility.
    - The new heavens and new earth are the consummation of God’s redemptive plan.
    - Believers will enjoy perfected communion with God in a restored creation.
    - Calvin avoids speculative details about the nature of the renewed world.
    - "The restoration of the world is promised, not only to be freed from corruption, but to be endowed with new qualities." (Commentary on Romans 8:21)

5. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - All eschatological hope is centered on the person and work of Christ.
    - Union with Christ guarantees participation in resurrection and eternal life.
    - The believer’s present life is oriented toward future glory in Christ.
    - Eschatology is not merely future-oriented but shapes present faith and obedience.
    - "Our eyes must be directed to Christ, because in him alone the completion and fulfillment of all the blessings which we hope for is found." (Institutes 3.25.10)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s eschatology has profoundly shaped **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the certainty of resurrection, the reality of the intermediate state, and the cosmic scope of redemption. His insistence on biblical restraint discouraged speculative end-times schemes and fostered a Christ-centered, hope-filled perspective. Calvin’s influence endures in confessional standards and continues to inform contemporary discussions on the **renewal of creation** and the believer’s eternal hope.
