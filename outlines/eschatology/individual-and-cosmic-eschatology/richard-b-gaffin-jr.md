# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **individual and cosmic eschatology** is marked by a strong emphasis on the **resurrection**, the **already/not yet** structure of **redemptive history**, and the centrality of **union with Christ**. Gaffin insists that eschatology is not merely a future concern but is foundational to the entire Christian life, shaping both personal salvation and the destiny of creation.

- "Eschatology is not simply one among many doctrines but is fundamental to the structure of New Testament revelation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (in The Glory of the Atonement, ed. Hill & Letham)
- "The Centrality of the Resurrection" (Westminster Theological Journal)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Central to New Testament Theology**
    - Eschatology is not a peripheral doctrine but undergirds all of **Paul’s theology**.
    - The **inaugurated eschatology** of the New Testament means believers live between the ages.
    - The resurrection of Christ marks the beginning of the **new creation**.
    - The Christian life is shaped by the tension of the **already/not yet**.
    - "Eschatology is not an appendix to the doctrine of salvation, but its foundation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Resurrection as the Heart of Eschatology**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the decisive event in both **individual and cosmic eschatology**.
    - The resurrection is the firstfruits of the final **bodily resurrection** for believers.
    - The resurrection signals the defeat of death and the inauguration of the **age to come**.
    - The believer’s present life is defined by participation in Christ’s resurrection.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event in the history of redemption." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Union with Christ as the Eschatological Center**
    - All eschatological blessings are mediated through **union with Christ**.
    - Justification, sanctification, and glorification are inseparable from union with the risen Lord.
    - The believer’s resurrection life is a present reality through the Spirit.
    - Cosmic renewal is tied to the believer’s union with Christ, the **second Adam**.
    - "Union with Christ is the central soteriological reality in Paul." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **The Already/Not Yet Structure of Salvation**
    - Salvation is both a present possession and a future hope.
    - The Spirit is the **down payment** of the believer’s future inheritance.
    - The overlap of the ages explains the ongoing struggle with sin and suffering.
    - Final consummation awaits Christ’s return, but the powers of the age to come are already at work.
    - "The Christian lives in the tension between what has already been accomplished and what remains to be fulfilled." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Cosmic Scope of Redemption**
    - Eschatology encompasses not only individuals but the entire **created order**.
    - The resurrection of Christ guarantees the renewal of the cosmos.
    - The final state involves the restoration of all things, not annihilation.
    - The church’s mission is eschatological, bearing witness to the coming new creation.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new creation, the first installment of the cosmic renewal." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions of **eschatology**, especially through his articulation of the **already/not yet** and the centrality of the resurrection. His influence is evident in the resurgence of Pauline studies that emphasize union with Christ and inaugurated eschatology. Gaffin’s integration of individual and cosmic dimensions of redemption continues to inform systematic theology, biblical theology, and the life of the church.
