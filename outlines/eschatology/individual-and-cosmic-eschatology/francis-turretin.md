# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a comprehensive **Reformed eschatology** that carefully distinguished between **individual eschatology** (the fate of the soul after death) and **cosmic eschatology** (the final destiny of creation). He affirmed the **intermediate state**, the **resurrection of the body**, and the **final judgment**, grounding these doctrines in **Scripture** and the **orthodox Reformed tradition**. Turretin’s approach emphasized the continuity of God’s redemptive purposes from the individual believer to the consummation of all things in the new creation.

- "The resurrection is not only possible, but necessary, from the justice and veracity of God, and from the indissoluble connection between the mystical body and its head." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 20.7.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 3, Topics 20–21)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on the State of Souls after Death (in Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Individual and Cosmic Eschatology**
   - Clearly separates the fate of the soul after death from the final renewal of all things.
   - Argues that **individual eschatology** concerns the soul’s immediate entrance into either blessedness or punishment.
   - **Cosmic eschatology** involves the resurrection, judgment, and transformation of the cosmos.
   - Maintains that both aspects are essential for a full understanding of Christian hope.
   - "The state of souls after death and the resurrection at the last day are distinct, yet inseparably connected in the divine economy." (Institutes, 20.1.5)

2. **Affirmation of the Intermediate State**
   - Teaches that souls are conscious and exist apart from the body between death and resurrection.
   - Rejects the notion of **soul sleep** or annihilation.
   - The righteous enjoy communion with Christ; the wicked experience punishment.
   - The intermediate state is provisional, awaiting the final resurrection.
   - "The souls of the pious are received into heaven, while those of the wicked are thrust into hell, both awaiting the resurrection." (Institutes, 20.1.13)

3. **Necessity and Nature of the Bodily Resurrection**
   - The resurrection is both possible and necessary due to God’s justice and promises.
   - The same bodies that die will be raised, though glorified and transformed.
   - Resurrection is essential for the consummation of redemption and the vindication of the body.
   - Unites the **mystical body** of Christ with its Head in glory.
   - "The resurrection is required by the justice of God, the promises of Christ, and the union of the saints with him." (Institutes, 20.7.2)

4. **Final Judgment and Eternal States**
   - Asserts a universal, public judgment at the end of history.
   - The righteous are rewarded with eternal life; the wicked are condemned to eternal punishment.
   - Judgment is based on union with Christ and the evidence of faith.
   - The final state is irreversible and definitive.
   - "After the resurrection, follows the general judgment, in which the eternal destinies of all will be declared." (Institutes, 20.10.1)

5. **Renewal of the Cosmos**
   - The present creation will be purified and transformed, not annihilated.
   - The new heavens and new earth are the arena of eternal blessedness for the redeemed.
   - The cosmic renewal is the final goal of God’s redemptive plan.
   - Emphasizes the continuity of creation and redemption.
   - "The world will not be destroyed as to substance, but renewed and restored to a more excellent state." (Institutes, 21.6.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous distinctions and careful exegesis shaped the **Reformed orthodox** approach to eschatology, providing a systematic framework that influenced later confessional standards and theologians. His articulation of both **individual and cosmic eschatology** remains a touchstone for Reformed dogmatics, especially in discussions of the intermediate state and the resurrection. Turretin’s legacy endures in the clarity and precision with which he addressed the ultimate hope of believers and the destiny of creation.
