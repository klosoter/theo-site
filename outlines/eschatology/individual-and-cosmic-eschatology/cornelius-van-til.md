# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **individual and cosmic eschatology** through the lens of **Reformed theology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the inseparability of **redemptive history** and **eschatological fulfillment**, arguing that both the destiny of the individual and the cosmos are grounded in the sovereign plan of the **triune God**. For Van Til, eschatology is not an isolated doctrine but is integrally related to the **covenant**, the **lordship of Christ**, and the consummation of God's self-revelation.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology is covenantally grounded**
    - Eschatology must be understood within the framework of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The destiny of both individuals and the cosmos is determined by their covenantal relationship to God.
    - The **covenant structure** unites personal salvation and cosmic renewal.
    - The fulfillment of eschatology is the consummation of God's covenant promises in Christ.
    - "The covenantal relationship is basic to all of God’s dealings with man, both in time and in eternity." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Christocentric consummation**
    - The **person and work of Christ** are central to both individual and cosmic eschatology.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the guarantee of the believer’s future resurrection and the renewal of creation.
    - The final state is the full realization of Christ’s lordship over all things.
    - Eschatological hope is inseparable from union with Christ.
    - "It is in Christ that all things, both in heaven and on earth, are to be summed up." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Antithesis and the final judgment**
    - The **antithesis** between belief and unbelief is ultimately resolved in the final judgment.
    - Individual destinies are determined by their response to God’s revelation in Christ.
    - The cosmic order will be purged of all opposition to God at the end of history.
    - The final judgment vindicates God’s justice and mercy.
    - "The final separation of the righteous and the wicked is the ultimate expression of the antithesis." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Redemptive-historical unity**
    - All of history is a unified, unfolding **redemptive-historical** process.
    - Eschatology is not merely about the end, but about the direction and purpose of all history.
    - The individual’s salvation is part of the broader cosmic renewal.
    - The new creation is the telos of God’s redemptive plan.
    - "History moves inexorably toward the consummation God has ordained." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Presuppositional apologetic and eschatology**
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in the **presupposition** of God’s self-attesting revelation.
    - Unbelieving worldviews cannot account for meaning in history or hope for the future.
    - Only the Christian worldview provides a coherent basis for both individual and cosmic eschatology.
    - Apologetics must point to the certainty of God’s eschatological victory.
    - "Only on the presupposition of the truth of Christianity can one make sense of history and its goal." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s integration of **eschatology** with covenant theology and presuppositional apologetics has shaped Reformed approaches to both apologetics and systematic theology. His emphasis on the unity of **individual and cosmic eschatology** has influenced generations of theologians to see eschatology as central to the Christian worldview. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of Reformed apologetics and in the robust affirmation of Christ’s lordship over all of history and creation.
