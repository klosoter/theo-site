# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s approach to **individual and cosmic eschatology** is rooted in his Christocentric theology, emphasizing the decisive revelation of God’s future in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**. Barth resists speculative timelines, focusing instead on the **eschatological event** as the fulfillment of God’s promise, which encompasses both the destiny of the individual and the renewal of all creation. For Barth, **resurrection**, **judgment**, and the **consummation of history** are realities grounded in Christ’s victory.

- "The goal of the ways of God with man and the world is the revelation of Jesus Christ, and in Him the new world." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

- Dogmatics in Outline
- The Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - Eschatology is inseparable from the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - The resurrection is the definitive eschatological event, inaugurating the new creation.
    - All individual and cosmic fulfillment is realized in Christ’s history.
    - Christ is both the Judge and the Redeemer in the final consummation.
    - "Jesus Christ is Himself the end of all things, the fulfillment of all time." (Dogmatics in Outline)

2. **Rejection of Speculative Timetables**
    - Barth opposes attempts to predict or systematize the chronology of the end times.
    - Eschatology is not about future events but about the present reality of God’s promise.
    - The future is hidden in God and revealed only in Christ.
    - Human history is oriented toward its end, but the manner and timing remain God’s secret.
    - "We do not know the day or the hour, and we are not to know it." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

3. **Universal Scope of Redemption**
    - Barth emphasizes the cosmic dimension of salvation, not just individual destiny.
    - The renewal of creation is part of God’s eschatological purpose.
    - All things are reconciled in Christ, pointing to a universal hope.
    - The **new creation** is the ultimate goal of God’s redemptive work.
    - "In Him all things are made new." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Resurrection and Judgment as One Event**
    - Resurrection and judgment are united in the event of Christ’s return.
    - Judgment is not merely punitive but is the unveiling of truth in Christ.
    - The resurrection of the dead is the affirmation of God’s faithfulness to creation.
    - Individual destiny is determined in relation to Christ’s resurrection and judgment.
    - "The resurrection is the revelation of the righteous judgment of God." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

5. **Hope and the Hiddenness of the Future**
    - Christian hope is grounded in God’s faithfulness, not in human speculation.
    - The future is veiled, calling for trust rather than curiosity.
    - Eschatological hope is active, shaping Christian life and witness in the present.
    - The hiddenness of the end preserves the freedom and sovereignty of God.
    - "Hope that is seen is not hope; we wait for it with patience." (Dogmatics in Outline)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s **Christocentric eschatology** redirected modern theology away from speculative end-times schemes toward the centrality of Christ’s person and work. His emphasis on the **cosmic scope of redemption** and the unity of resurrection and judgment has deeply influenced both Protestant and ecumenical discussions of eschatology. Barth’s insistence on the hiddenness of the future and the priority of hope continues to shape contemporary theological reflection on the last things. His work remains foundational for understanding the relationship between individual destiny and the renewal of all creation in Christian doctrine.
