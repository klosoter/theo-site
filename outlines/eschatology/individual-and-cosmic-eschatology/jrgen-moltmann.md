# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann’s theology of **individual and cosmic eschatology** asserts that Christian hope is fundamentally oriented toward the **future fulfillment** of God’s promises in both personal resurrection and the **renewal of all creation**. He maintains that **eschatology** is not merely a doctrine of last things but the very foundation of Christian faith, shaping both existential and cosmic dimensions of salvation.

- "From first to last, and not merely in the epilogue, Christianity is eschatology, is hope, forward looking and forward moving." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- God in Creation (1985)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as the Center of Christian Theology**
    - Eschatology is foundational, not peripheral, to Christian doctrine.
    - The **future of God** shapes present faith and ethical action.
    - Hope is constitutive for Christian existence and theology.
    - The resurrection grounds all eschatological expectation.
    - "Eschatology is not one element of Christianity, but it is the medium of Christian faith as such." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Integration of Individual and Cosmic Eschatology**
    - Individual resurrection is inseparable from the **renewal of the cosmos**.
    - Salvation is both personal and communal, involving all creation.
    - The eschaton brings transformation to humanity and the world.
    - The new creation fulfills God’s promise to all that exists.
    - "God’s eschatological future embraces the whole creation, not just the soul or the church." (The Coming of God)

3. **The Resurrection as the Foundation of Hope**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the prolepsis of the future for all.
    - Resurrection hope is existential (for individuals) and universal (for creation).
    - The resurrection breaks the power of death and opens history to new possibilities.
    - The risen Christ guarantees final redemption.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new creation of the world." (Theology of Hope)

4. **Universal Reconciliation and the Renewal of Creation**
    - God’s final purpose is the reconciliation and renewal of all things.
    - Judgment is restorative, aiming at the healing of creation.
    - The eschatological vision includes the defeat of evil and suffering.
    - The **kingdom of God** is a cosmic reality, not merely spiritual or individual.
    - "God’s justice and God’s love are one in the end: universal reconciliation." (The Coming of God)

5. **Political and Ethical Implications of Eschatology**
    - Eschatological hope motivates engagement with history and society.
    - The future of God calls Christians to resist oppression and injustice.
    - Hope is active, inspiring transformation in anticipation of God’s coming reign.
    - The church is a sign and instrument of the coming kingdom.
    - "Those who hope in Christ can no longer put up with reality as it is." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s **eschatological theology** has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of hope, resurrection, and the renewal of creation. His integration of **individual and cosmic eschatology** has influenced both academic theology and practical Christian ethics, especially in political theology and ecological responsibility. Moltmann’s vision continues to inspire theologians to see eschatology as central to Christian faith and action, emphasizing the transformative power of hope for both persons and the world.
