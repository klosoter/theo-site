# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos is renowned for his biblical-theological approach to **eschatology**, emphasizing the organic unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of **consummation** in both individual and cosmic dimensions. He distinguished between the **"already" and "not yet"** aspects of the **kingdom of God**, situating personal destiny within the broader scope of cosmic renewal. Vos’s work highlights the inseparability of **individual resurrection** and the ultimate transformation of creation.

- "Eschatology is not a mere appendix to the doctrine of the covenant, but its very substance." (Pauline Eschatology)

## Key Works

- The Pauline Eschatology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit" (Princeton Theological Review, 1900)
- "The Kingdom of God" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5: Ecclesiology, The Means of Grace, Eschatology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Central to Redemptive History**
    - Eschatology is woven into the fabric of **covenant theology** from the beginning, not merely appended at the end.
    - The movement of history is teleological, oriented toward **consummation** in Christ.
    - The **kingdom of God** is both inaugurated and awaiting final fulfillment.
    - The Old Testament anticipates the eschatological hope realized in the New Testament.
    - "The world-process is not a mere development, but a movement toward a goal." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Already/Not Yet Structure of the Kingdom**
    - The **kingdom** is present in Christ’s first coming but awaits completion at his return.
    - Believers experience **inaugurated eschatology** through union with Christ.
    - The tension between present possession and future hope shapes Christian life.
    - This framework governs both individual salvation and cosmic renewal.
    - "The eschatological is not something that comes at the end, but something that runs through the whole process." (Pauline Eschatology)

3. **Individual Eschatology: Resurrection and Judgment**
    - The **resurrection of the body** is central to personal hope.
    - Final **judgment** determines eternal destinies in union with or separation from Christ.
    - The intermediate state is provisional, awaiting bodily resurrection.
    - Personal eschatology is inseparable from the cosmic scope of redemption.
    - "The resurrection is not an isolated event, but the beginning of the new world." (Pauline Eschatology)

4. **Cosmic Eschatology: New Creation**
    - The **renewal of creation** is the climax of redemptive history.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the firstfruits of the **new heavens and new earth**.
    - The curse is reversed, and creation is restored to its intended glory.
    - The cosmic and individual aspects of eschatology are mutually interpretive.
    - "The eschatological hope is not merely for the soul, but for the cosmos." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Organic Unity of Eschatological Revelation**
    - Scripture unfolds eschatology progressively, with unity across the Testaments.
    - Typology and promise-fulfillment structures reveal God’s eschatological purposes.
    - The **Spirit** is the agent of both individual and cosmic transformation.
    - The church lives in the overlap of the ages, embodying eschatological realities.
    - "Revelation moves forward organically, each stage preparing for the final consummation." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s biblical-theological method profoundly shaped **Reformed eschatology**, influencing generations of theologians and pastors. His articulation of the **already/not yet** framework became foundational for understanding the relationship between individual destiny and cosmic renewal. Vos’s integration of **redemptive history** with eschatological hope continues to inform contemporary discussions on the unity of Scripture and the scope of salvation. His legacy endures in both academic theology and the preaching of the church.
