# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **individual and cosmic eschatology** with a strong emphasis on the **Christological center** of all eschatological hope, integrating both the destiny of the individual believer and the renewal of creation within the broader scope of **redemptive history**. He rejected speculative schemes, focusing instead on the **already/not yet** tension and the **consummation** of all things in Christ. Berkouwer’s eschatology is marked by a careful avoidance of both existential reductionism and apocalyptic sensationalism.

- "The expectation of the future is not a matter of curiosity, but of faith in the God who fulfills his promises." (The Return of Christ)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - Eschatology is inseparable from the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - The resurrection is the foundation for both individual and cosmic hope.
    - All eschatological fulfillment is oriented toward Christ’s final victory.
    - The meaning of history is disclosed in the light of Christ’s return.
    - "Eschatology is not an appendix to Christology, but its fulfillment." (The Return of Christ)

2. **Already/Not Yet Tension**
    - The **kingdom of God** is both inaugurated and awaiting consummation.
    - Believers live in the tension between present participation and future fulfillment.
    - The present age is marked by both victory and struggle.
    - Eschatological hope shapes ethical living in the present.
    - "The New Testament speaks of the future as a reality that has already begun." (The Return of Christ)

3. **Holistic View of Redemption**
    - **Redemption** encompasses both individuals and the entire cosmos.
    - The renewal of creation is integral to Christian hope.
    - Sin’s effects are cosmic, and so is Christ’s restoration.
    - The final state is not escape from creation, but its transformation.
    - "The expectation of the new earth is not a myth, but the fulfillment of God’s promise to his creation." (The Return of Christ)

4. **Rejection of Speculation**
    - Eschatology must avoid detailed timetables and speculative predictions.
    - The focus is on the certainty of Christ’s return, not its chronology.
    - Apocalyptic imagery is interpreted theologically, not literally.
    - The church is called to watchfulness, not calculation.
    - "Scripture does not satisfy our curiosity, but calls us to hope and vigilance." (The Return of Christ)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity**
    - There is both continuity and discontinuity between the present world and the world to come.
    - The resurrection body is both transformed and recognizable.
    - The new creation fulfills, rather than abolishes, the old.
    - Individual destiny is bound up with the cosmic renewal.
    - "The resurrection is not the annihilation of creation, but its glorious renewal." (The Return of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s **systematic theology** provided a nuanced and biblically grounded account of eschatology that avoided both existential reductionism and speculative excess. His emphasis on the **Christological center** and the unity of individual and cosmic hope has influenced Reformed theology globally. Berkouwer’s careful exegesis and pastoral sensitivity continue to shape discussions on the meaning of Christian hope and the future of creation.
