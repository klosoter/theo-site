### TITLE
The Already–Not Yet of Judgment and Glory: Uniting Individual and Cosmic Eschatology in Reformed Dogmatics

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How the death–intermediate state–resurrection–final judgment sequence for the individual coheres with the once-for-all consummation of all creation, without collapsing one into the other or fracturing the unity of God’s **eschatological kingdom**.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Geerhardus Vos, N. T. Wright.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic Latin eschatology, medieval scholastic synthesis, Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed **federal theology** and **covenant theology**, and selected modern biblical-theological developments and challenges.
- Debates:
  - Internal: beatific vision and intermediate state, timing and nature of the millennium, continuity and discontinuity of the new creation, relation of **union with Christ** to final judgment.
  - External: annihilationism and universalism, soul sleep and conditional immortality, process and open theist revisions of **divine providence** and **final judgment**.
  - Contemporary: ecological and political readings of new creation, inaugurated eschatology and over-realized “kingdom now” claims, personal identity and resurrection in light of modern philosophy.
- Defended position: A classic Reformed, Augustinian eschatology in which disembodied believers enjoy conscious communion with Christ in the intermediate state, the wicked endure conscious punishment, history moves toward a single bodily resurrection and last judgment at Christ’s visible return, and God consummates a renewed yet truly transformed creation, integrating individual destiny and cosmic renewal under the already–not yet of Christ’s **eschatological lordship**.

### ESSAY
Individual and cosmic eschatology together pose a single doctrinal question: how God’s **eschatological kingdom** brings each person and the entire creation to their divinely appointed end in Christ. To treat them as two unrelated domains, one “private” and one “cosmic,” is already to concede a dualism foreign to Scripture and to catholic and Reformed dogmatics. The core issue is whether the same Christ, by the same **federal headship**, by the same **covenant of grace**, brings believers through death, intermediate state, resurrection, and judgment into the same new heavens and new earth that represent the cosmic completion of his mediatorial reign. The position to be defended is that of classic Reformed, Augustinian eschatology: a conscious intermediate state, a single general resurrection and judgment at the visible return of Christ, eternal life and eternal punishment, and a renewed yet genuinely transformed creation in which the individual believer’s glorification is inseparably tied to the restoration and transfiguration of the cosmos.

Augustine is decisive because he gave the West its basic eschatological framework, binding individual destiny to the history of the two cities. In the City of God, especially books 19 through 22, he interprets all of history as the conflict and coexistence of the **civitas Dei** and the **civitas terrena**, culminating in the final separation at the last judgment. For Augustine, individual eschatology is not a private fate but the person’s definitive location in one of these two cities. He holds to the immortality of the soul, though as a received and dependent immortality, not intrinsic to the creature. After death, the righteous enjoy a provisional rest with Christ, the wicked a provisional punishment, both awaiting the resurrection of the body. His fierce defense of the resurrection against Platonizing spiritualism is crucial: salvation is not escape from embodiment but the healing and glorifying of embodied creatures. Yet each person’s destiny is settled by their relation to Christ, the one Mediator whose body is the church. From Augustine forward, Latin eschatology largely assumes this integration: individual status is settled in history and consummated in the same eschatological event that transforms the world.

Examiners will probe whether this Augustinian frame is genuinely biblical or an imposition. The Augustinian can answer that Christ’s own teaching in Matthew 25 binds the personal and cosmic together: the Son of Man comes in glory, sits in judgment over all nations, and assigns each person to eternal life or eternal punishment, while simultaneously establishing the kingdom prepared “from the foundation of the world.” Likewise Romans 8 unites the resurrection of believers with the liberation of creation from its bondage to decay. Augustine may overplay the institutional aspect of the two cities, but the structural insight stands: individual eschatology unfolds within the larger economy of God’s **eschatological kingdom**.

Thomas Aquinas develops Augustine’s inheritance into a precise synthesis, giving later Western theology its most careful account of the intermediate state and the final **beatific vision**. In the Summa Theologiae, especially in the tertia pars and the supplement, Thomas argues that the separated soul of the righteous, immediately upon death, can enjoy the vision of God’s essence, though in an imperfect mode, and that this vision is the formal cause of beatitude. For Thomas, individual eschatology climaxes not in participation in a cosmic process but in the soul’s perfected act of **analogical knowledge** of God. Yet he carefully preserves the necessity and goodness of bodily resurrection. The soul by nature is the form of the body; its separated state is metaphysically incomplete. The final state thus requires a reconstituted body, and the new creation provides the fitting milieu for embodied rational creatures whose highest act is contemplative.

Here a typical Westminster examiner will press: does Thomistic focus on the **beatific vision** distort the biblical emphasis on resurrected life in a renewed creation, threatening a de facto spiritualizing eschatology? A Reformed response must be nuanced. On the one hand, Thomas is right that the fundamental blessedness of the saints is immediate, unmediated seeing of God in Christ. Any eschatology that does not climax in face-to-face communion with the triune God is sub-Christian. On the other hand, the Thomistic scheme, as received in some scholastic and devotional traditions, can marginalize the resurrection and the new creation, or treat them as peripheral adornments to a purely intellectual fulfillment. The Reformed tradition, while affirming the **beatific vision**, insists that this vision occurs in and through the resurrected Christ, in our resurrected bodies, within a renewed cosmos. The vision is not an escape from creation but its highest fulfillment.

It is Calvin who more fully integrates Augustinian and biblical emphases into a distinctly Reformation eschatology that binds individual communion with Christ to the resurrection hope and the conflict of the ages. In his Institutes, especially book 3, Calvin places **union with Christ** at the center of individual and cosmic eschatology. Justification, sanctification, perseverance, and glorification are all benefits of this union. Individual eschatology is thus fundamentally Christological: to die is to “depart and be with Christ,” which is “far better,” precisely because union with the exalted Christ cannot be broken by death. Calvin vigorously rejects “soul sleep,” arguing from Christ’s words to the thief on the cross and from Paul’s contrasting of being “at home in the body” and “at home with the Lord.” The intermediate state is conscious, personal, and Christ-centered, though incomplete because the believer is “naked,” awaiting the resurrection clothing.

Calvin simultaneously resists speculative curiosity about the intermediate state and over-realized visions of inaugurated glory. His emphasis lies on the future resurrection and judgment, when Christ will consummate his mediatorial kingship. In his catechetical and homiletical work, he regularly invokes the final judgment as the public vindication of God’s righteousness and the church, and as the definitive separation of church and world. This is critical to preserving the ethical edge of eschatology: individual hope for glory is not a private therapeutic experience but part of the cosmic manifestation of God’s justice and mercy.

Here internal Reformed debates emerge, particularly over the millennium and the mode of Christ’s mediatorial reign. Though Calvin himself is generally amillennial, his concern is not to deny historical development but to maintain that the “thousand years” of Revelation symbolizes the present gospel age. That means the **already–not yet** structure is intrinsic to Reformed eschatology: the kingdom is present in power and mystery, but not yet present in glory. This allows Calvin to affirm vigorous cultural and ecclesial engagement without collapsing the new creation into human civilizational projects. In exam context, you must show how this guards against both quietist otherworldliness and triumphalist theologies of culture.

Geerhardus Vos stands as the key modern Reformed figure who reconfigures eschatology via biblical theology, without forsaking classic dogmatic commitments. In his Pauline Eschatology and his biblical theological lectures, Vos insists that eschatology is not simply about the temporal end but about the teleological goal embedded in creation from the beginning. Adam was created under a **covenant of works** with an eschatological prospect: advancement from mutable goodness to confirmed glory. The fall did not introduce eschatology but made redemptive eschatology necessary. In this light, individual and cosmic eschatology are subsumed under the history of the covenants in Christ. The believer’s death and resurrection participation in Christ is a subset of the larger pattern whereby Christ, the last Adam, introduces the age to come into history.

Vos’s breakthrough lies in his articulation of the **already–not yet**. In Christ’s death and resurrection, the powers of the age to come have already intruded. Believers are already raised with Christ, seated with him in heavenly places, yet they await bodily resurrection and the visible appearance of the kingdom. This inaugurated eschatology simultaneously magnifies individual assurance and cosmic hope: the Spirit unites each believer now to the resurrected Christ, the firstfruits, and guarantees their future resurrection as part of the harvest that includes the liberation of creation itself. Romans 8 becomes programmatic: the Spirit’s indwelling is the “firstfruits,” the down payment of both personal and cosmic renewal.

Yet Vos’s framework raises potential dangers that examiners will exploit. Does inaugurated eschatology open the door to over-realized claims that believers already fully possess kingdom realities, depreciating the sacraments as pilgrim ordinances and minimizing suffering and groaning? The Reformed defense must stress Vos’s own insistence on **eschatological tension**. The new age has truly begun, but the old age persists; believers are citizens of heaven yet still in Adamic flesh; the creation is subject to futility yet pregnant with glory. Any scheme that denies present possession of salvation reality is sub-Pauline; any scheme that denies ongoing tribulation and future consummation is likewise sub-Pauline.

N. T. Wright, though often a critic of traditional eschatologies, is decisive in contemporary discussions because he has forced evangelicals to reckon with the **bodily resurrection** and the **new creation** in fresh ways. In The Resurrection of the Son of God and Surprised by Hope, Wright argues that much Western Christianity slid into a Platonizing individualism that framed eschatology as going to “heaven when you die,” marginalizing the resurrection of the body and the renewal of creation. He emphasizes that the New Testament hope is for resurrection and new creation, with “heaven” as a present reality of God’s space and power, not the final goal. He insists that the resurrection of Jesus is the beginning of new creation and that Christian mission participates in God’s project of putting the world to rights.

Wright’s emphasis rightly corrects any neglect of the cosmic dimension of eschatology and re-centers the bodily resurrection as non-negotiable. He also reasserts the significance of history: God’s future is not a timeless escape but the victorious redemption of his creation project. However, Wright is less clear and sometimes equivocal on the intermediate state, final judgment, and eternal punishment. This has enabled softer readings of hell, inclining some toward annihilationism or universalist speculation. Moreover, his rhetoric that “God will put the world to rights” has been co-opted by political theologies that collapse the distinctiveness of the eschatological kingdom into social programs, risking an over-realized eschatology that equates current justice projects directly with kingdom consummation.

A Reformed engagement with Wright must proceed in two moves. First, affirm the correction: eschatology that does not climax in **bodily resurrection** and **new creation** fails the apostolic pattern. Individual salvation apart from a transformed creation is sub-biblical. Second, reassert what Wright underplays: the conscious intermediate state in the presence of Christ, the final once-for-all public judgment, and the eternal, conscious punishment of the wicked. The new creation comes only after sin and death are definitively judged; no biblical pattern sanctions the idea that the world is gradually transformed into the kingdom apart from the catastrophic return of Christ.

Having sketched the key figures and trajectories, the doctrine itself can be stated. Individual eschatology concerns the sequence and nature of human existence in relation to God beyond death. At death, the soul and body are separated. In line with Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, and Reformed orthodoxy, the soul is not annihilated or unconscious; rather, believers are immediately in a state of conscious blessedness with Christ, unbelievers in conscious misery under God’s wrath. This intermediate state is provisional. It lacks the completeness of embodied existence and the public, corporate dimension of the final kingdom. Its purpose is to hold the saints and the wicked in their respective states until the resurrection and judgment.

Cosmic eschatology concerns God’s final action toward the world order: the visible return of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, the last judgment, and the inauguration of the new heavens and new earth. At Christ’s return, one general resurrection occurs, both of the righteous and the wicked. There is one public judgment that vindicates God’s own righteousness, reveals the justice of his decrees, and assigns each person to eternal life or eternal punishment. Then Christ, in his mediatorial capacity, delivers the kingdom to the Father, yet without any loss of his divine rule, so that God may be all in all. The creation itself is renewed, not replaced. This renewal is both continuous and discontinuous: continuity in that it is the same creation healed and glorified, discontinuity in that it is purged of curse, sin, and death, transfigured by the glory of God.

External debate partners challenge nearly every element of this account. Annihilationists argue that eternal conscious punishment is inconsistent with divine goodness, proposing that the wicked will be finally destroyed. Universalists insist that God’s love and victory require that all persons and possibly all rational beings will eventually be saved. Both often appeal to the restorative and cosmic language in Scripture. From the standpoint of **divine justice** and **covenantal righteousness**, the Reformed reply notes that Scripture consistently affirms both cosmic renewal and irreversible personal destinies. Revelation 21 and 22 speak of a renewed creation where nothing unclean enters, but immediately prior, Revelation 20 speaks of a second death and a lake of fire. The parallel structure of eternal life and eternal punishment in Matthew 25 undermines hopes for universal restoration. Divine love does not negate divine holiness; the cross itself is the supreme display of both. To eliminate hell is either to empty the cross of its propitiatory depth or to posit a God whose threats are empty.

Soul sleep and conditional immortality challenge the conscious intermediate state and the ongoing existence of the soul. Here Augustine, Aquinas, and Calvin together provide a coherent account: human nature as created composite of body and soul, where the soul is capable of existing without the body by divine sustentation, though such existence is unnatural and interim. Scriptural texts about “sleep” refer to bodily appearance and the suspension of earthly action, not metaphysical unconsciousness. Christ’s parable of the rich man and Lazarus and Paul’s desire to depart and be with Christ cannot be squared with soul sleep.

Modern process and open theist approaches attack eschatology at the level of God’s being and **providence**. If God is temporal, passible, and learning, there can be no infallible decree of final judgment or guaranteed new creation. The future is open, even to God. Against this, the Reformed defense must appeal to **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **foreknowledge**. The certainty of final judgment and the new creation rests not on an extrapolated trend but on the eternal and unchangeable decree of the triune God, executed in Christ’s resurrection. A God who does not know or sovereignly direct the end cannot offer genuine eschatological hope, only probabilistic optimism.

Contemporary debates raise subtler issues. Ecological and political theologies rightly emphasize the cosmic dimension of redemption and the calling of the church to witness to God’s justice. But some over-identify kingdom with historical social orders or ecological states. The new creation is not a mere improvement of current political arrangements nor the ecological equilibrium achieved by human effort. It comes by an apocalyptic act of God at Christ’s return. Yet the already–not yet allows room to say that Spirit-empowered obedience, including justice and care for creation, anticipates and witnesses to that coming order, without causing or constituting it.

Philosophical concerns about personal identity and resurrection question how a numerically identical person can survive death and be raised if their material continuity is disrupted. Here the Reformed tradition appeals not to a crude material continuity but to the continuity of person as established by God’s faithful knowledge and preservation. The same God who calls the worlds into being calls the dead to life. Identity is grounded ultimately in God’s covenantal remembering. Continuity of body is real, but it is a continuity secured by God’s reconstituting act, not by unbroken material persistence.

Finally, the integration of individual and cosmic eschatology must be made explicit. Individual hope is not for a disembodied spiritualized eternity but for resurrection life in the new creation. Cosmic hope is not an impersonal process but the glorification of a people united to Christ. The ordo salutis culminates in participation in the historia salutis: the believer’s personal glorification is a share in Christ’s cosmic victory. This guards against two distortions examiners will probe. One is individualistic eschatology that treats salvation as private bliss, using the world and the church merely as means to an otherworldly end. The other is collectivist or structural eschatology that loses the individual, treating salvation as a global project in which particular persons are subsumed.

The defended position holds both together in the person of the risen Christ. As the representative last Adam, Christ brings each elect believer through death, intermediate state, resurrection, and judgment into eternal fellowship with God in a renewed creation. As Lord of all, he subjects the entire cosmos to himself, purging it of evil and filling it with his glory. There is one eschaton, one goal; individual and cosmic eschatology are two perspectives on that single consummation. The **already–not yet** of Christ’s reign guarantees both present participation and future consummation, preserving assurance without triumphalism and hope without illusion.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Individual and cosmic eschatology together describe how the triune God, through Christ’s **eschatological kingdom**, brings each person and the whole creation from death and judgment into resurrection life or eternal punishment, culminating in a renewed yet transformed new heavens and new earth.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: two cities framework, conscious intermediate state, unified view of personal and cosmic judgment.
  - Thomas Aquinas: detailed account of the intermediate state and **beatific vision**, insisting on bodily resurrection while centering contemplative communion with God.
  - John Calvin: **union with Christ** as the key to individual destiny, robust defense of conscious intermediate state, amillennial reading of history under Christ’s present reign.
  - Geerhardus Vos: biblical-theological reframing of eschatology as inherent in creation, strong **already–not yet** structure tying personal salvation to redemptive history.
  - N. T. Wright: modern emphasis on **bodily resurrection** and **new creation**, correcting reduction of hope to “heaven at death,” but often soft on intermediate state and eternal punishment.
- Debates:
  - Internal: nature of **beatific vision** and its relation to embodied life; timing and nature of the millennium; continuity and discontinuity in the new creation; extent of inaugurated eschatology.
  - External: annihilationism and universalism versus eternal conscious punishment; soul sleep and conditional immortality versus conscious intermediate state; process and open theism versus sovereign, decretive **providence**.
  - Contemporary: ecological and political readings of the kingdom; “kingdom now” theologies and over-realized **already–not yet**; philosophical puzzles about personal identity in resurrection.
- Defended position: Classic Reformed, Augustinian eschatology affirming a conscious intermediate state for believers and unbelievers, a single general bodily resurrection and last judgment at Christ’s visible return, eternal life and eternal punishment, and a renewed yet genuinely transformed creation where individual glorification and cosmic renewal are inseparably united under Christ’s **mediatorial kingship**.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - How do you avoid Platonizing “heaven” while retaining a real intermediate state?  
    By treating the intermediate state as conscious but provisional communion with Christ, ordered to bodily resurrection and life in the new creation.
  - Why insist on eternal conscious punishment instead of annihilationism or universalism?  
    Because Scripture parallels eternal life and punishment and presents judgment as the irreversible vindication of God’s **justice** and truth.
  - How does inaugurated eschatology avoid over-realized “kingdom now” theology?  
    By affirming real present participation in Christ’s resurrection life while insisting the full kingdom glory awaits his sudden, visible return and the final judgment.
  - What grounds personal identity in resurrection if our matter changes?  
    God’s faithful covenantal remembering and reconstituting power secures numerical identity, with bodily continuity as his work, not mere material persistence.
  - In what sense is new creation “this” creation made new rather than a replacement?  
    The same world is purged and glorified, as implied by resurrection continuity and Romans 8, yet transformed so thoroughly that it is rightly called “new.”
