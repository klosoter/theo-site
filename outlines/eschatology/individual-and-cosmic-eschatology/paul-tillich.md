# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **individual and cosmic eschatology** through the lens of his **systematic theology**, emphasizing the **symbolic** and **existential** dimensions of eschatological hope. He rejected literalist readings of **resurrection** and **final judgment**, instead interpreting them as expressions of the ultimate meaning and fulfillment of existence in relation to the **eternal**.

- "Eternal life is not continuation after death, but participation in the power of the eternal present." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Symbolic Expression**
    - Eschatological language is fundamentally **symbolic**, not literal.
    - Symbols point to the **ultimate concern** and the fulfillment of existence.
    - Cosmic and individual eschatology express the same existential reality.
    - The "end" is not a temporal event but a **transcendent** reality.
    - "The symbols of eschatology are not predictions but expressions of the ultimate meaning of history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Eternal Life as Participation in the Eternal**
    - **Eternal life** is a quality of existence, not endless duration.
    - It is realized through participation in the **ground of being**.
    - The distinction between temporal and eternal is existential, not chronological.
    - Individual destiny is fulfilled in relation to the **eternal present**.
    - "Eternal life means participation in the divine life here and now." (The Eternal Now)

3. **Resurrection and Judgment as Existential Realities**
    - **Resurrection** symbolizes the victory of the **new being** over estrangement.
    - **Judgment** is the existential encounter with the ground of being.
    - Both are interpreted as present realities, not future events.
    - The final judgment is the self-revelation of ultimate meaning.
    - "Judgment is the manifestation of what we are in the face of the ultimate." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Unity of Individual and Cosmic Eschatology**
    - Individual and cosmic destinies are inseparable in Tillich’s thought.
    - Both are fulfilled in the **kingdom of God** as the symbol of ultimate fulfillment.
    - The **new creation** is not a future world but the transformation of existence.
    - The cosmic process is oriented toward the realization of meaning.
    - "The end of history is the fulfillment of history in the eternal." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Rejection of Literal Apocalypticism**
    - Tillich rejects literal readings of apocalyptic texts.
    - Apocalyptic imagery points to existential anxieties and hopes.
    - The **second coming** is a symbol for the ever-present possibility of renewal.
    - The transformation of reality is ongoing, not a single event.
    - "Apocalyptic language expresses the ultimate seriousness of existence, not a timetable of events." (The Protestant Era)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s **symbolic** and **existential** approach to eschatology has profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in its dialogue with philosophy and existentialism. His reinterpretation of **eternal life**, **resurrection**, and **judgment** challenged traditional doctrines and opened new avenues for understanding the relationship between time, history, and the **eternal**. While controversial among confessional theologians, Tillich’s framework remains influential in contemporary discussions of eschatology and the meaning of ultimate fulfillment.
