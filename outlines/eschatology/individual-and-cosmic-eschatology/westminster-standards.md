# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a comprehensive vision of **individual and cosmic eschatology** within a Reformed framework. They affirm the certainty of **bodily resurrection**, **final judgment**, and the ultimate renewal of all things in Christ, emphasizing both the immediate destiny of the soul after death and the consummation of history in the **new heavens and new earth**.

- "At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed: and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and shall be made accountable before the tribunal of Christ." (Westminster Confession of Faith 32.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapters 32–33
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 84–90
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 37–38
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immediate State After Death**
    - The souls of believers are made perfect in holiness and immediately pass into glory.
    - The souls of the wicked are cast into hell, where they remain in torment.
    - There is no intermediate state of purgatory.
    - The body remains in the grave, awaiting resurrection.
    - "The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption; but their souls...immediately return to God who gave them." (WCF 32.1)

2. **Bodily Resurrection**
    - All the dead will be raised at the last day, both righteous and wicked.
    - The same bodies that died will be raised, though transformed.
    - The resurrection is grounded in union with Christ.
    - The righteous will be raised to honor; the wicked to dishonor.
    - "All the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other." (WCF 32.2)

3. **Final Judgment**
    - God has appointed a day to judge the world in righteousness by Jesus Christ.
    - All persons will appear before Christ’s tribunal to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds.
    - The righteous will receive everlasting life; the wicked everlasting punishment.
    - The purpose is the manifestation of God's justice and mercy.
    - "God hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world, in righteousness, by Jesus Christ." (WCF 33.1)

4. **Consummation of All Things**
    - The present world will be renewed and perfected as the **new heavens and new earth**.
    - The kingdom of Christ will be fully realized in glory.
    - Sin, death, and evil will be finally eradicated.
    - The redeemed will enjoy God forever in perfect blessedness.
    - "Then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fulness of joy and refreshing, which shall come from the presence of the Lord." (WCF 33.2)

5. **Certainty and Comfort for Believers**
    - The doctrine of eschatology is meant to assure believers of their future hope.
    - Believers are exhorted to live in holiness and expectation of Christ’s return.
    - The resurrection and judgment are sources of encouragement amid suffering.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ’s finished work and promises.
    - "The souls of believers are at their death made perfect in holiness, and do immediately pass into glory." (WSC 37)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped Reformed teaching on **eschatology**, providing a systematic and biblically grounded account of both individual destiny and cosmic renewal. Their formulations have influenced confessional documents and catechesis across Presbyterian and Reformed traditions worldwide. The Standards’ clear articulation of the **resurrection**, **final judgment**, and the hope of the **new creation** continues to serve as a touchstone for orthodox Reformed eschatological thought.
