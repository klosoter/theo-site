# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **individual and cosmic eschatology** from a distinctly **Reformed** and **presuppositional** perspective, emphasizing the sovereignty of God over both personal destiny and the consummation of history. He integrates **redemptive history** and **systematic theology**, arguing that the future hope of believers and the renewal of creation are inseparable from the lordship of Christ and the unfolding of the **covenant**. Frame’s eschatology is marked by a strong emphasis on the **already/not yet** tension and the practical implications of future hope for present obedience.

- "Eschatology is not merely about the future; it is about the present implications of God’s promises for his people." (Systematic Theology)

   - Salvation is both personal and corporate, culminating in the new heavens and new earth.

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s approach to **individual and cosmic eschatology** has reinforced the centrality of Christ’s lordship and the unity of redemptive history in Reformed theology. His emphasis on the practical and ethical implications of eschatological hope has influenced pastors and theologians to integrate future expectation with present obedience. By highlighting the covenantal and comprehensive scope of God’s promises, Frame has contributed to a robust and holistic vision of Christian hope. His work continues to shape discussions on the relationship between personal salvation and the renewal of creation within evangelical and Reformed circles.
