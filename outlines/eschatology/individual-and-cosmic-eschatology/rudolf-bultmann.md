# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **individual and cosmic eschatology** through the lens of **demythologization**, insisting that New Testament eschatological language must be interpreted existentially rather than as literal predictions of future events. He argued that **eschatology** is fundamentally about the individual's encounter with the **kerygma** and the call to authentic existence before God, rather than a sequence of cosmic events or a timetable for the end of history.

- "The real meaning of eschatology is not the expectation of a future event, but the understanding of existence as determined by the eschatological event of Christ." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Eschatology**
    - Eschatological language in the New Testament is mythological and must be reinterpreted for the modern worldview.
    - The apocalyptic imagery is not a literal forecast but expresses existential truths about human existence.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential message behind the myth.
    - The focus is on the individual's response to the proclamation, not on cosmic speculation.
    - "It is not the world that is to end, but the worldliness of man." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Judgment and Salvation**
    - Judgment is realized in the present encounter with the Word, not in a future tribunal.
    - Salvation is an existential transformation, not merely a future hope.
    - The individual's decision in response to the **kerygma** is the decisive eschatological event.
    - Authentic existence is marked by openness to God in the present.
    - "Eternal life is not a future event but a present reality for the believer." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Christ Event as the Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The coming of Christ is the decisive eschatological event in history.
    - All cosmic and individual eschatology is reinterpreted in light of the Christ event.
    - The resurrection is not a historical event but the proclamation of new life.
    - The significance of Christ is existential, not chronological or cosmological.
    - "The eschatological event has already happened in Christ." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Rejection of Apocalyptic Timetables**
    - Bultmann denies the validity of literal apocalyptic expectations.
    - The New Testament's imminent expectation of the end is a mythological form.
    - The urgency of eschatology is existential, not chronological.
    - The future is not a calendar event but an existential possibility.
    - "The expectation of the imminent end of the world is not essential to the Christian faith." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Eschatology as Decision and Encounter**
    - Eschatology is realized in the individual's encounter with the **kerygma**.
    - The decisive moment is the present, where one is called to faith.
    - The cosmic dimension is secondary to the existential call to authenticity.
    - The meaning of history is found in personal decision, not in cosmic fulfillment.
    - "Every moment is the eschatological moment." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's existential reinterpretation of **eschatology** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **New Testament studies** and existentialist thought. His emphasis on **demythologization** challenged traditional readings and provoked ongoing debate about the relationship between faith and history. While many criticized his approach as reductionistic, his work remains a touchstone for discussions about the meaning of eschatological language and the existential dimension of Christian proclamation. Bultmann’s influence endures in both academic theology and broader conversations about the relevance of Christian eschatology in the modern world.
