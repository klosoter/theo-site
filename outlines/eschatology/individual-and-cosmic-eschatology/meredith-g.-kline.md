# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline developed a distinctive approach to **individual and cosmic eschatology** rooted in his covenantal and typological reading of Scripture. He emphasized the **intrusion of the eschaton** into history, the **two-age structure** of redemptive history, and the ultimate **consummation** of both individuals and the cosmos in Christ. Kline’s framework highlights the continuity between **creation, judgment, and new creation**, situating personal destiny within the broader cosmic renewal.

- "The end is not merely a return to the beginning but a consummation that transcends the original creation." ("Kingdom Prologue")

## Key Works

- "Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview"
- "Images of the Spirit"
- "By Oath Consigned"
- "The Structure of Biblical Authority"
- "God, Heaven and Har Magedon"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Intrusion into History**
    - God’s final judgment and glory are anticipated in historical events, especially in the Old Testament.
    - Typological episodes (e.g., the Flood, conquest of Canaan) serve as previews of the ultimate eschaton.
    - The Mosaic covenant is seen as an intrusion of the **consummative order** into the present age.
    - This perspective shapes both individual destiny and cosmic expectation.
    - "Intrusions of the final judgment into history are essential for understanding biblical eschatology." ("Kingdom Prologue")

2. **Two-Age Structure of Redemptive History**
    - Kline distinguishes between the **present evil age** and the **age to come**.
    - The resurrection inaugurates the new creation, but its fullness awaits Christ’s return.
    - Believers experience inaugurated eschatology now, but not its consummation.
    - This structure frames both personal resurrection and cosmic renewal.
    - "The two-age schema is fundamental to the biblical outlook on history and destiny." ("God, Heaven and Har Magedon")

3. **Cosmic Consummation and New Creation**
    - The destiny of the cosmos is a **transformation** rather than mere annihilation.
    - The new heavens and new earth fulfill the original creation mandate.
    - Cosmic renewal is tied to Christ’s resurrection as firstfruits.
    - The final state is marked by the full presence of God with his people.
    - "The new creation is the ultimate realization of the kingdom purpose begun in Eden." ("Kingdom Prologue")

4. **Individual Eschatology within Covenant Framework**
    - Individual destiny is inseparable from covenantal representation (Adam and Christ).
    - Judgment and reward are distributed according to covenantal headship.
    - The intermediate state is provisional, awaiting bodily resurrection.
    - Personal eschatology is always set within the broader redemptive-historical context.
    - "Individual hope is grounded in the corporate destiny of the covenant community." ("Images of the Spirit")

5. **Judgment and Sabbath Consummation**
    - Final judgment is both punitive and purifying, leading to Sabbath rest.
    - The Sabbath principle structures both history and eschatological hope.
    - The consummation is a **Sabbath rest** for God’s people and creation.
    - The motif of rest underscores the goal of both individual and cosmic eschatology.
    - "The Sabbath consummation is the telos of both the individual and the cosmos." ("Kingdom Prologue")

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s eschatological vision has profoundly shaped **Reformed biblical theology**, especially in its understanding of the relationship between **individual salvation** and cosmic renewal. His emphasis on typology, covenant, and the two-age structure has influenced generations of scholars and pastors. Kline’s work continues to inform contemporary debates on the nature of the new creation, inaugurated eschatology, and the integration of personal and cosmic hope within the biblical narrative.
