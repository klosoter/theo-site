# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—present a comprehensive Reformed understanding of both **individual eschatology** (what happens to the soul after death) and **cosmic eschatology** (the final consummation of all things). They emphasize the certainty of **resurrection**, the reality of **final judgment**, and the hope of **new creation** for believers, rooted in the work of **Christ** and the sovereignty of **God**.

- "After this life, the souls of the faithful are received to life everlasting, but the unbelievers to eternal death." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 57)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (Articles 37)
- Heidelberg Catechism (Lord’s Days 22, 52)
- Canons of Dort (Main Points I, V)
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Certainty of Bodily Resurrection**
    - Affirms that believers will be raised bodily at the last day.
    - Resurrection is grounded in union with **Christ’s resurrection**.
    - The body and soul will be reunited for eternal life or judgment.
    - Resurrection is a comfort and hope for believers facing death.
    - "I believe that the very body which now lies in the grave shall be raised by the power of Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 57)

2. **Immediate State After Death**
    - The souls of believers go immediately to be with Christ after death.
    - The wicked are immediately cast into eternal condemnation.
    - Denies the existence of **purgatory** or intermediate states.
    - Emphasizes the conscious experience of both reward and punishment.
    - "The souls of the faithful are received to life everlasting as soon as they leave the body." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

3. **Final Judgment and Justice**
    - Christ will return to judge the living and the dead.
    - All people will appear before the judgment seat of Christ.
    - The righteous will receive everlasting life; the wicked, eternal punishment.
    - Judgment is public, just, and glorifies God’s righteousness.
    - "All men will appear personally before this great Judge... to render account." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

4. **Consummation of the New Creation**
    - God will create a new heaven and new earth for His people.
    - The restoration is physical, not merely spiritual.
    - Believers will dwell eternally with God, free from sin and suffering.
    - The cosmic scope of redemption highlights God’s sovereignty over all things.
    - "God will create a new heaven and a new earth, wherein righteousness dwells." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

5. **Assurance and Comfort for Believers**
    - Eschatological hope is a source of present assurance.
    - The certainty of resurrection and eternal life is grounded in Christ’s promises.
    - The doctrine encourages perseverance and godliness.
    - Comfort is offered in the face of death and suffering.
    - "The resurrection of the body and the life everlasting comfort me in all my sorrows." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 58)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed teaching on **individual and cosmic eschatology**, providing a clear, confessional framework for understanding death, resurrection, judgment, and the new creation. Their articulation of the believer’s hope in Christ and the certainty of God’s final victory continues to inform Reformed worship, preaching, and pastoral care. These confessions remain foundational for Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring doctrinal continuity and a robust eschatological vision.
