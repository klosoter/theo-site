# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck’s approach to **individual and cosmic eschatology** is marked by a robust affirmation of the unity between personal destiny and the renewal of all creation. He insists that the **resurrection of the body**, the **final judgment**, and the **new heavens and new earth** are inseparably linked to God’s redemptive purposes in Christ, emphasizing both the continuity and transformation of creation. Bavinck’s eschatology is deeply rooted in the **Reformed doctrine of consummation**, highlighting the hope of believers and the ultimate restoration of the cosmos.

## Legacy and Impact

His emphasis on the **restoration of creation** and the bodily resurrection has influenced contemporary discussions on the relationship between redemption and creation.
