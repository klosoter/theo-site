# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner’s approach to **individual and cosmic eschatology** is shaped by his emphasis on the existential encounter between the human person and God, and his rejection of speculative or purely future-oriented eschatological schemes. Brunner insists that **eternal life** and **judgment** are realities grounded in the present relationship with Christ, while also affirming the ultimate renewal of creation in the **consummation** of God’s purposes. He critiques both liberal demythologizing and overly literal apocalypticism, seeking a **Christocentric** and personalist understanding of the end.

- "Eternal life is not a future state, but fellowship with God, which begins here and now." (Eternal Hope)

## Key Works

- Eternal Hope (1946)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation (Dogmatics, Vol. III)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Man in Revolt (1937)

   - Emphasizes the existential reality of **encounter with God** as the heart of eschatology.
   - Sees eschatological hope as grounded in the present relationship with Christ.
   - Critiques both rationalist and mythological distortions of biblical eschatology.

2. **Personal Resurrection and Judgment**
   - Affirms the **resurrection of the individual** as essential to Christian hope.
   - Stresses the reality of **personal judgment** before God.
   - Rejects notions of impersonal immortality or soul survival apart from God’s act.
   - Links resurrection and judgment to the person’s response to Christ in history.
   - "The resurrection is not a natural immortality, but a new act of God." (Dogmatics III)

3. **Cosmic Consummation in Christ**
   - Asserts that the **renewal of creation** is inseparable from Christ’s lordship.
   - The **cosmic dimension** of eschatology is fulfilled in the final victory of God.
   - Avoids speculative details about the end times, focusing on the certainty of God’s purpose.
   - Creation’s destiny is bound to the fulfillment of God’s covenant in Christ.
   - "The end of the world is the fulfillment of the world in Christ." (Dogmatics III)

4. **Present Realization and Future Fulfillment**
   - Emphasizes the **already/not yet** tension in Christian hope.
   - Eternal life begins now in fellowship with God, but awaits consummation.
   - The kingdom is present in Christ, but its fullness is future.
   - Believers live in anticipation, marked by hope and responsibility.
   - "Eternal life is a present possession and a future promise." (Eternal Hope)

5. **Rejection of Universalism and Annihilationism**

   - "The possibility of being lost is the shadow side of the possibility of being saved." (Eternal Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s eschatology has influenced modern Protestant thought by emphasizing the **existential and relational dimensions** of both individual and cosmic hope. His Christocentric and personalist approach offered a corrective to both liberal reductionism and speculative apocalypticism, shaping discussions within **neo-orthodoxy** and beyond. Brunner’s work continues to be referenced for its insistence on the centrality of **resurrection** and the present reality of eternal life, even as some critique his reluctance to engage more fully with biblical apocalyptic imagery.
