# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale is a leading contemporary Reformed biblical theologian whose work on **individual and cosmic eschatology** emphasizes the inaugurated nature of the **kingdom of God** and the already/not yet tension in **New Testament eschatology**. Beale argues that **eschatological fulfillment** is rooted in the Old Testament and climaxes in Christ, with both individual destiny and cosmic renewal integrally connected to the resurrection and new creation. His scholarship highlights the continuity between **personal resurrection** and the ultimate **restoration of creation**.

- "The New Testament’s eschatology is both individual and cosmic, with the resurrection of believers and the renewal of the cosmos being inseparably linked in Christ." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- The Temple and the Church’s Mission: A Biblical Theology of the Dwelling Place of God
- Revelation: A Shorter Commentary
- The Book of Revelation (NIGTC)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
    - The **kingdom of God** is already inaugurated in Christ’s first coming but awaits consummation.
    - Believers experience **spiritual resurrection** now, anticipating bodily resurrection.
    - The **already/not yet** framework shapes both individual and cosmic eschatology.
    - Old Testament prophetic hopes are partially fulfilled in the church and fully in the new creation.
    - "The end-time new creation has begun in Christ’s resurrection and the outpouring of the Spirit." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

2. **Cosmic Restoration**
    - Eschatology is not limited to individual salvation but includes the renewal of the entire cosmos.
    - The **new heavens and new earth** are the ultimate goal of redemptive history.
    - The curse on creation will be reversed through Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The church participates in the cosmic renewal as the temple of God.
    - "The final state is not a removal from creation but its transformation and glorification." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

3. **Resurrection as Central**
    - The **resurrection of Christ** is the foundation for both individual and cosmic eschatology.
    - Believers’ resurrection is patterned after Christ’s, guaranteeing personal and cosmic renewal.
    - The resurrection signals the defeat of death and the inauguration of the new creation.
    - The hope of resurrection shapes Christian ethics and mission.
    - "The resurrection is the beginning of the new creation, both for individuals and the cosmos." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

4. **Temple Motif and Eschatology**
    - The biblical temple points forward to the eschatological dwelling of God with his people.
    - The church is now the temple, anticipating the full presence of God in the new creation.
    - The expansion of the temple motif reflects the spread of God’s reign to all creation.
    - Eschatological hope is tied to the restoration of God’s presence among his people.
    - "The temple’s expansion is a picture of the cosmic scope of God’s eschatological purposes." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

5. **Continuity of Old and New Testament Eschatology**
    - New Testament eschatology fulfills Old Testament promises in unexpected ways.
    - Typology and prophetic patterns reveal unity in God’s redemptive plan.
    - The **Day of the Lord** and new creation themes are reinterpreted in light of Christ.
    - Individual and cosmic eschatology are inseparable in biblical theology.
    - "The Old Testament’s eschatological hopes are realized in Christ and extended to his people and the cosmos." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed eschatology**, especially regarding the integration of individual and cosmic dimensions. His emphasis on the **already/not yet** framework and the centrality of the resurrection has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to eschatology. By grounding New Testament hope in Old Testament promises, Beale has provided a robust biblical-theological foundation for understanding the destiny of both believers and creation. His scholarship continues to inform debates on the nature of the **new creation** and the church’s role in God’s eschatological purposes.
