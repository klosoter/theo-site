# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a comprehensive account of **individual and cosmic eschatology** within the framework of **Christian doctrine**, emphasizing the rational coherence of **resurrection**, **final judgment**, and the **beatific vision**. He distinguished between the **particular judgment** at death and the **general resurrection** at the end of time, integrating these with his broader metaphysical and theological system.

- "The ultimate end of human life is the vision of God, which is called beatitude." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 3, a. 8)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially Supplement, qq. 69–99)
- Summa Contra Gentiles (Book IV, chapters 79–97)
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians (notably ch. 15)
- De Malo (esp. q. 5, on death and judgment)
- Selected Questions on the Soul

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Beatific Vision as Ultimate Fulfillment**
   - Human destiny culminates in the direct, intuitive knowledge of God.
   - The **beatific vision** is possible only after the resurrection, when body and soul are reunited.
   - This vision is the perfect and eternal happiness for the redeemed.
   - The vision of God is granted by grace, not by natural human capacity.
   - "Final and perfect happiness can consist in nothing else than the vision of the Divine Essence." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 3, a. 8)

2. **Particular and General Judgment**
   - Each soul undergoes a **particular judgment** immediately after death.
   - The **general judgment** occurs at the end of time, involving the resurrection of all and public vindication of divine justice.
   - Both judgments are rooted in the justice and mercy of God.
   - The general judgment restores cosmic order and reveals the full scope of providence.
   - "The soul is at once judged after death, but the general judgment is for the manifestation of each one's works." (Summa Theologiae Supplement, q. 88, a. 1)

3. **Resurrection of the Body**
   - The resurrection is necessary for the completion of human nature, which is a union of body and soul.
   - All humans will be raised, the just to glory and the wicked to punishment.
   - The resurrected body will be numerically the same but glorified for the righteous.
   - The resurrection is grounded in Christ’s own resurrection and the justice of God.
   - "The resurrection of the body is necessary for the full recompense of both the good and the wicked." (Summa Contra Gentiles IV, ch. 79)

4. **Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory**
   - Heaven is the state of perfect union with God; hell is eternal separation and punishment.
   - **Purgatory** purifies those destined for heaven who die in grace but are not yet fully sanctified.
   - The states of the soul after death are irrevocable after the final judgment.
   - The joys and pains of these states correspond to the soul’s relationship to God.
   - "Some are cleansed of their sins in this life, others after death in purgatory." (Summa Theologiae Supplement, q. 71, a. 6)

5. **Cosmic Renewal and the New Creation**
   - The final consummation includes the renewal of the entire cosmos.
   - The new creation will be incorruptible, reflecting the glory of the resurrected saints.
   - The material world participates in the eschatological transformation.
   - This renewal manifests the fullness of divine providence and order.
   - "The world itself will be renewed, so that it may correspond to the glory of the saints." (Summa Theologiae Supplement, q. 91, a. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **eschatology** shaped both Catholic and broader Christian understandings of the **resurrection**, **final judgment**, and the **beatific vision**. His careful distinctions between individual and cosmic aspects of the last things provided a systematic framework for later theology. The enduring influence of his thought is evident in magisterial teaching and ongoing ecumenical dialogue, making his eschatological vision foundational for Western Christian doctrine.
