# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray’s eschatology is marked by a strong emphasis on the **unity of redemptive history** and the centrality of the **resurrection** for both individual believers and the entire cosmos. He carefully distinguishes the **intermediate state** from the **final state**, grounding Christian hope in the consummation of all things in Christ and the believer’s **union with Christ** as the foundation of eschatological expectation.

- "The resurrection of believers is not an isolated event; it is integrally bound up with the resurrection of Christ and the consummation of redemption." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied (1955)
- The Epistle to the Romans (1959, NICNT)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "The Advent of Christ and the Consummation of Redemption" (essay in Collected Writings)
- Principles of Conduct (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as Central to Eschatology**
    - The resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits and guarantee of the believer’s resurrection.
    - The resurrection of the body is essential for the completion of redemption.
    - The resurrection marks the transition from the intermediate to the final state.
    - The resurrection is inseparable from the renewal of the cosmos.
    "The resurrection of the body is the apex of the believer’s hope." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Intermediate State Distinct from Final State**
    - The soul of the believer is immediately with Christ at death, but this is not the final state.
    - The intermediate state is a state of conscious blessedness, yet incomplete.
    - Full redemption awaits the reunion of body and soul.
    - The final state is inaugurated at the return of Christ and the general resurrection.
    "The intermediate state is not the ultimate hope of the believer; it is the resurrection unto life." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Cosmic Renewal and Consummation**
    - The scope of redemption includes the entire created order.
    - The new heavens and new earth are the setting for the consummated kingdom.
    - The curse is fully removed in the cosmic renewal.
    - The final state involves both individual glorification and cosmic restoration.
    "Redemption is not complete until creation itself is delivered from the bondage of corruption." (Romans, NICNT)

4. **Final Judgment as Vindication and Separation**
    - The final judgment is a public event demonstrating God’s justice and mercy.
    - All humanity will be judged according to their relationship to Christ.
    - The judgment results in eternal life or eternal punishment.
    - The final judgment vindicates the righteousness of God in history.
    "The final judgment will be the public manifestation of the discriminating grace and justice of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Union with Christ as Eschatological Foundation**
    - Union with Christ secures the believer’s participation in resurrection life.
    - The benefits of Christ’s work are applied to believers in both the present and future.
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in the believer’s incorporation into Christ.
    - The consummation is the full realization of union with Christ in glory.
    "It is in union with Christ that the hope of glory is assured and realized." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s eschatology has significantly shaped **Reformed theology** by emphasizing the inseparability of individual and cosmic aspects of redemption. His careful distinction between the intermediate and final states, and his insistence on the centrality of the resurrection, continue to influence both academic and pastoral approaches to Christian hope. Murray’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a biblically grounded, Christ-centered eschatology that honors the unity of **redemptive history**.
