# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **eschatology** is foundational for Western Christianity, integrating both **individual** and **cosmic dimensions**. He emphasizes the **resurrection of the body**, the **final judgment**, and the ultimate destinies of the **City of God** and the **City of Man**, framing personal salvation within the consummation of history in the **eternal state**.

- "Two cities have been formed by two loves: the earthly by the love of self, even to the contempt of God; the heavenly by the love of God, even to the contempt of self." (City of God, XIV.28)

## Key Works

- The City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- Confessions
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- Sermons on the Creed
- Letters (Epistulae)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection of the Body**
    - Affirms the bodily resurrection of all people at the end of history.
    - Connects resurrection to Christ’s own resurrection as the firstfruits.
    - Emphasizes continuity and transformation of the physical body.
    - Resurrection is necessary for the final judgment and eternal destinies.
    "For as by the sin of the first man came death, so by the resurrection of the second Man came the resurrection of the dead." (City of God, XX.6)

2. **Final Judgment**
    - Asserts a universal, public judgment at the end of the age.
    - The righteous and wicked are separated eternally.
    - Judgment is based on faith and works, revealing the justice of God.
    - The final judgment inaugurates the eternal state for both cities.
    "All shall rise, and all shall be judged, that both the good and the evil may receive according to their works." (Enchiridion, 109)

3. **Two Cities: City of God and City of Man**
    - Human history is a conflict between two spiritual communities.
    - The City of God is destined for eternal communion with God.
    - The City of Man is marked by self-love and destined for destruction.
    - Eschatology is the ultimate unveiling of these two destinies.
    "The end of the two cities, therefore, will be twofold: one will reign with God eternally, the other will suffer eternal punishment with the devil." (City of God, XXI.1)

4. **Intermediate State**
    - Souls exist consciously between death and resurrection.
    - The righteous experience a foretaste of blessedness; the wicked, of torment.
    - Prayers for the dead may benefit those in Christ, but not alter ultimate destinies.
    - The intermediate state is temporary, awaiting the resurrection.
    "The time which intervenes between a man's death and the final resurrection holds the soul in an intermediate state." (Enchiridion, 109)

5. **Eternal State: Heaven and Hell**
    - The blessed enjoy eternal life in the presence of God.
    - The wicked endure eternal separation and punishment.
    - Both conditions are irreversible after the final judgment.
    - The eternal state fulfills God’s justice and mercy in Christ.
    "The wicked shall be tormented without end, and the good shall live in eternal happiness." (City of God, XXI.23)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s eschatology shaped the **Western Christian tradition**, especially in articulating the doctrines of **resurrection**, **final judgment**, and the nature of **eternal life** and punishment. His vision of the **two cities** provided a theological framework for understanding history and the church’s place within it. Later theologians, both Catholic and Protestant, drew heavily on Augustine’s synthesis of individual and cosmic eschatology, making his work a cornerstone for subsequent doctrinal development.
