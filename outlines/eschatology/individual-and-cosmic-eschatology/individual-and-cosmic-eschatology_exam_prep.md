### ESSAY
Eschatology is teleology under promise. Individual eschatology concerns the destiny of persons through death, the intermediate state, resurrection, judgment, and everlasting state. Cosmic eschatology concerns the destiny of the world order, the parousia of Christ, the general resurrection, judgment according to works, and the advent of the new heavens and new earth. The governing task is integration, not juxtaposition. The Bible never treats an individual’s future apart from his head, nor the world’s future apart from its Lord. The proper grammar is **federal theology**, where destiny is ordered by headship in Adam and in Christ, and the logic is **already–not yet**, where the age to come intrudes without erasing the present. Within that grammar, the anchor of hope is the **resurrection of the body**, and the telos is the **beatific vision** of the triune God, enjoyed in an embodied, social, and cosmic **new creation**. The position defended here is amillennial and classically Reformed: the souls of the righteous at death are made perfect in holiness and pass immediately into communion with Christ in heaven, the wicked to conscious misery; at a single visible return of Christ all will be raised, judged, and assigned to everlasting life or death; the saints will behold God in Christ by the Spirit in the renewed creation; the wicked will endure everlasting punishment; there is no purgatory; there is no carnal earthly millennium. This vision secures doctrinal coherence with **divine simplicity**, the unity of Christ’s work, and the integrity of creation.

Augustine set the conceptual horizon. In The City of God he dismantled pagan cyclical fate by orienting history to God’s promise and judgment. He located the church between the advents as the pilgrim city, intermingled with the worldly city until the last judgment. Augustine’s anti-chiliasm cut the nerve of carnal expectations of a thousand-year reign and placed Revelation 20 within the church age, identifying Satan’s binding with the gospel’s advance. More profoundly, he recentered hope around God himself. For Augustine, the human telos is the vision and enjoyment of God, the fruition of the ordo amoris. In this, he decisively bound individual and cosmic futures. The vision of God is not the private rapture of isolated souls but the communal sabbath of a redeemed civitas, where God is all in all. His exegesis of 1 Corinthians 15 framed the resurrection as the perfection of created nature, not its replacement. At the same time, Augustine’s pastoral realism dealt candidly with the intermediate state. He affirmed the immediate translation of the faithful to heaven and warned of punishments for the wicked, while speculating cautiously about purgative processes for some believers. Reformed theology would later excise speculative purgation while keeping Augustine’s core: one history under God, one final judgment, and the soul’s conscious interim with or without Christ. In examiner’s terms, Augustine gives you the canonical map: a two-cities eschatology that rejects chiliastic excess and centers the **beatific vision** as the consummation of the saints.

Thomas Aquinas refined the end-state with analytic precision. Within an Aristotelian hylomorphic anthropology, he argued for the immortality of the rational soul and for the identity of the risen body through the form of the soul. His account of the **beatific vision** is unsurpassed: the blessed see the divine essence not by a created image but by a created light, lumen gloriae, elevating the intellect to a participation proportioned by grace. This anchors eschatology in **divine simplicity** and immutability. What the blessed see is not a part or attribute but God himself. Aquinas thereby guards against trivializing heaven as a change of scenery. Essential beatitude is the vision of God; accidental beatitude includes the heightened goods of resurrected life. This makes the individual’s end and the cosmic end reciprocally explanatory. The eye of the resurrected will see God, and the renewed cosmos is the theater of that communion. The medieval accretions are well known. Aquinas developed a robust purgatory on the basis of satisfaction and temporal punishments. Here the Reformation drew a hard line, not because it denied growth in holiness but because it denied the soteriological logic of postmortem satisfaction and read the sufficiency of Christ’s cross as the full expiation of guilt and penalty for his own. Yet many Reformed theologians retrieved, with Bavinck as exemplar, Aquinas’s core insight that the **beatific vision** is the apex of creaturely good, and any eschatology that cannot integrate that vision with a robust doctrine of the renewed earth has not yet come to rest.

John Calvin restructured Christian hope in an evangelical key. His Psychopannychia dismantled soul sleep, arguing from Christ’s word to the thief, from Paul’s desire to depart and be with Christ, and from the presentation of the heavenly assembly that the faithful are consciously with the Lord between death and resurrection. He insisted that the **intermediate state** is penultimate and abnormal, not the final beatitude. In the Institutes he accented union with Christ as the axial reality that carries the believer through death into glory. The benefits of justification and sanctification culminate in glorification, so that soteriology opens onto eschatology. At the same time Calvin expelled purgatory as a denial of Christ’s sufficiency and a pastoral engine of fear. His Eucharistic theology called the supper a true participation in Christ by the Spirit, an earnest of immortality and of the coming feast. For cosmic eschatology, Calvin is decisively Augustinian. He reads Revelation symbolically, resists chiliastic speculations, and insists on one general resurrection and judgment. Calvin’s most valuable correction to medieval piety is his anti-gnostic insistence on the **resurrection of the body** as the good of created nature redeemed. Examiners will press whether Calvin’s account of the soul preserves the goodness of embodiment. The answer is that Calvin defends a hylomorphic duality in which the soul survives bodily death without diminishing the dignity of the body, precisely because resurrection is the telos and the **intermediate state** is a sojourn, not a home.

Geerhardus Vos is the modern master of eschatology’s integration with biblical theology. In The Pauline Eschatology and his broader corpus at Princeton he argued that eschatology is not a late repair to a fallen order but is built into creation. The first Adam stood under a probation that opened onto a higher, irreversible state of sabbath glory. The Spirit’s eschatological work is therefore creationally ordered, not merely remedial. The fall replots the path to that goal through redemption in the second Adam. This re-centers the whole topic by rooting both individual and cosmic futures in the history of special revelation. The cross and resurrection are the turning point of the ages. The Spirit’s indwelling is the arrabon, the down payment of the inheritance, so that the life to come is already present in the saints. Vos rejects both consistent futurism that collapses everything into the parousia, and realized eschatology that domestically absorbs the future into the church. He shows instead how the new creation is already operative in Christ’s resurrection, sacramentally signified, ethically enacted, and cosmically awaited. Revelation 20 is read in the context of apocalyptic symbol, not as a newspaper chronology, and the millennium is the age between the advents where Satan’s binding permits the nations to be discipled. The individual believer stands inside this drama: union with Christ relocates his life within the eschatological age, making sanctification participation in resurrection life. Vos thereby properly subordinates individual eschatology to the corporate and cosmic without erasing individuality. For oral defense, Vos supplies the conceptual hinge: **already–not yet** is not a slogan but the formal structure that unites the **intermediate state** with the **new creation**, personal destiny with redemptive history.

Herman Bavinck integrates the catholic fullness of the Christian hope with Reformed dogmatics. In Reformed Dogmatics he affirms the immediate translation of the saint to Christ upon death and the certainty of a general resurrection and judgment. Yet his unique strength lies in the organic vision of **new creation**. Grace restores and perfects nature. The resurrection body is the same body, transformed by the Spirit’s power into incorruption and glory. Culture and history are not discarded but purified; the kings of the earth bring their glory into the city. This guards against both gnostic flight and chiliastic earthiness. Bavinck squarely faces the problem of hell, rejecting both annihilationism and universalism as contrary to divine justice and the gravity of sin, while insisting on the eschatological display of God’s mercy and righteousness. He retrieves Aquinas’s **beatific vision** and refuses to sever it from the embodied life of the age to come. The vision of God is not an escape from creation but its goal. God’s transcendence does not annihilate creaturely forms; it fills them. Bavinck also reframes Christian hope as the consummation of the **covenant of grace**, the public vindication of God’s promise to be God to his people.

Jürgen Moltmann represents a modern external pressure. In Theology of Hope and The Coming of God he redirected modern theology from existential presentism to future promise. He politicized eschatology, arguing that hope opens history and energizes liberative praxis. He criticized classical immutability and transcendence as incompatible with genuine futurity, proposed a panentheistic model of God arriving at himself in history, and while reticent about dogmatic universalism, tilted toward it by reading judgment as ultimately restorative. On the positive side, Moltmann rejects the spiritualization of hope, insists that the world matters, and reminds the church that hope is performative. Yet his program requires altering **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and the uniqueness of Christ’s cross and resurrection as definitive acts. The Reformed alternative keeps his ethical energy while refusing his metaphysical revisions. The Christian future is not God’s becoming but the creature’s consummation in God who eternally is.

With these figures clarified, we must face the layered debates. Internally, Reformed theology sustains disagreement over the millennium. Amillennialism, defended here, reads apocalyptic literature in its genre, takes the thousand years as a symbolic period of Christ’s heavenly reign and Satan’s partial restraint, and expects intensifying tribulation before the end. When examiners ask whether this sidesteps Revelation 20’s two resurrections, the answer appeals to Johannine usage: the first resurrection is the believer’s participation in Christ’s resurrection life, now and in the **intermediate state**, while the second is bodily and universal. The sequential visions are recapitulative, not strictly chronological. Another internal debate concerns the relation of **beatific vision** and **new creation**. Some fear that vision language privileges intellect over body and risks Platonizing hope. The better Reformed answer, after Bavinck and Vos, is to insist that the vision is through and in the incarnate Christ by the Spirit, communicated to embodied persons whose capacities are elevated, not erased. The vision gives rather than drains created goods. It is the glory that fills Zion, not a ladder out of it. A further internal debate centers on cultural continuity. Does redeemed culture endure into the age to come, and if so, how? Bavinck’s thesis of grace perfecting nature allows for continuity without naive carryover. The workmanship of the saints, as ordered to God’s glory, is not lost but taken up; what is of the flesh is burned away. This supports Christian vocation in the saeculum without making history the kingdom.

The debate over the **intermediate state** is perennially examined. Against soul sleep, one defends the biblical witness: Christ’s today you will be with me in paradise, Paul’s desire to depart and be with Christ as far better, the depiction of the souls under the altar crying out, and the description of the heavenly assembly of spirits of the righteous made perfect. The exegete must show that metaphors of sleep describe bodily death rather than psychic unconsciousness. Theologically, union with Christ implies that death cannot separate the believer from the personal presence of the Lord, though that communion awaits its bodily fullness at the resurrection. On the wicked’s state, texts speak of conscious misery and await their bodies for the full measure of judgment. Internal to the Reformed is also a dispute about the order of last things and Israel. The defended position rejects a discrete future earthly dispensation for ethnic Israel and holds that the church as the renewed Israel inherits the promises, while still expecting a large-scale ingathering of Jews before the end.

Externally, Rome’s doctrine of purgatory must be challenged. Its soteriology of temporal punishment remitted by satisfactions undermines Christ’s once-for-all atonement. The Reformed affirm postmortem moral transformation in the sense of being made perfect in holiness at death for the saints, but deny any penal purgation. Universalism and annihilationism raise acute questions about divine goodness and justice. Universalism collapses the gravity of sin and the cross’s urgency, and cannot square with the parallel of punishment and life in Matthew 25 or the consistent witness to unending punishment. Annihilationism underreads the metaphors of fire and worm and truncates retributive justice. Eternal conscious punishment is hard doctrine, but it is a corollary of the moral weight of God and the human person’s everlasting orientation to him. Dispensational premillennialism externalizes the kingdom into a near-future Jewish theocracy, fragments the people of God into earthly and heavenly, and bifurcates the parousia. The amillennial reading preserves the unity of Christ’s people and the single divine economy. Eastern Orthodox theosis can be helpfully received if it is rendered in terms of adoption and communion rather than essential absorption. Classical theism must remain intact: the creature participates by grace in the triune life while God remains what he eternally is. Secular naturalism, finally, denies any eschaton other than entropy. The Christian answer is not to posit a natural counterforce but to confess resurrection by the very power of God, the Creator who keeps covenant with creation.

Contemporary pressures require fresh articulation without doctrinal concession. Ecological anxiety can tempt either despair or an overrealized kingdom. The biblical doctrine of **new creation** commits us both to creation care and to confidence that the world’s end is not collapse into nothingness but transformation by the same power that raised Jesus. This is not license for exploitation but summons to stewardship as citizens of the coming city. Transhumanist projects promise digital afterlives or indefinite life extension. The Christian answer is that salvation is not survival of information nor endless prolongation of fallen life, but participation in Christ’s life through **resurrection of the body**. Technology may palliate, but it cannot redeem. The problem of hell presses theodicy. The answer must be anchored in God’s holiness and goodness: punishment corresponds to sin’s gravity and creaturely dignity, is administered by the righteous judge, and vindicates the moral structure of reality. Appeals to soft versions of judgment cannot sustain evangelical mission nor worship’s reverence. Scientific accounts of cosmic heat death pose no threat. The Christian confession of **covenant consummation** means that history’s end is a divine act, not a natural process, though it may involve cosmic convulsion. The creator-creature distinction liberates us from closed-system anxieties.

The defended position aligns doctrinally across loci. The Triune God is the blessed end of all things, so the **beatific vision** is not optional but the grammar of glory. **Divine simplicity** underwrites the indivisible good of God who is his life, so the vision is of God himself, not of a partial manifestation. Christology governs the mode of communion: the vision is by the Spirit, through the mediation of the incarnate Son, whose glorified humanity is the instrument and place of divine self-giving to creatures. Soteriology clarifies the path: union with Christ carries us through death and assures that the **intermediate state** is communion with him. Justification secures entrance, sanctification prepares, glorification perfects. **Federal theology** links the individual and corporate: as in Adam all die, so in Christ all his seed shall be made alive. Ecclesiology describes the present community of the age to come. The church is the embassy of the kingdom, its liturgy an audible and visible foretaste. The sacraments are promissory signs and seals, pledge of resurrection and feast of the Lamb. The Sabbath is an eschatological sign, pressing the pilgrim people toward rest. The prophetic ministry of the church addresses the saeculum not with despair or utopianism but with hope, patience, and repentance. Ethics, too, are ordered by the future. Those raised with Christ seek the things above, not to escape earth but to prepare for its renewal.

Examiner objections can be anticipated and answered succinctly within this coherent frame. Does affirming a conscious **intermediate state** risk Hellenistic dualism? No, because the abnormality of disembodiment is central, the body is good, and resurrection is telos. The interim underscores the victory of Christ over death, not a disdain for embodiment. Does the **beatific vision** threaten the goods of the renewed earth? No, because the vision is not a zero-sum intellectualism but the fullness of participation in God by which all creaturely goods are intensified and ordered. The city needs no sun because God’s glory illumines it, not because the city vanishes. Does amillennialism evade the specificity of prophetic promises to Israel? No, it fulfills them in the one seed, Christ, and in the ingrafted Gentiles and the future ingathering of Jews, preserving the unity of the covenant people. Is **eternal conscious punishment** disproportionate? It is proportionate to the infinite majesty of the one offended and to the will’s settled enmity, and it is disclosed by Christ’s own teaching. How do we square modern cosmology with cosmic renewal? The new creation is not the emergent effect of physical processes but the Creator’s act, and thus is not in competition with creaturely accounts.

The doctrine of last things is not a speculative appendix but the horizon of Christian truth. In a Reformed key, individual and cosmic eschatology are one piece. The saint dies in Christ and is with him, waits for the general resurrection and judgment, and rises to everlasting life in a renewed world illumined by God’s glory. The wicked die alienated and are raised to shame. There is one return of the Lord, one consummation of the covenant, one city that descends. The church now lives between the advents as the Spirit-filled outpost of the age to come. This vision dignifies bodies, validates history, energizes mission, restrains political idolatry, and sanctifies daily work. Above all, it promises God himself. The **beatific vision** does not pull us out of the world; it makes the world the holy place where God will dwell with man forever.
