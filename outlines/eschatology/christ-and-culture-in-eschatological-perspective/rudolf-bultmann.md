# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the relationship of **Christ and culture** through the lens of **eschatology**, emphasizing the existential encounter with Christ rather than the transformation of societal structures. He argued that the **kerygma** of the New Testament confronts each person with a decision in the present, demythologizing traditional eschatological expectations and focusing on **authentic existence** in response to the **proclamation of Christ**.

- "The eschatological event is not a cosmic catastrophe but the coming of the word of God to man." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

## Key Works

- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948–1953)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Eschatology**
   - Interprets biblical eschatology as mythological language expressing existential truths.
   - Rejects literal apocalyptic expectations in favor of existential decision.
   - Sees the **kerygma** as calling individuals to authentic existence now.
   - Emphasizes the present encounter with Christ over future historical fulfillment.
   - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life." ("New Testament and Mythology")

2. **Existential Interpretation of Christ**
   - Christ is encountered as the decisive call to authentic existence.
   - The meaning of Christ is realized in the individual's response of faith.
   - Downplays objective, historical claims in favor of subjective appropriation.
   - Christ's significance is eschatological in the sense of confronting the individual now.
   - "What matters is not the objective historicity of the event but its existential meaning for us." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

3. **Separation of Faith and Culture**
   - Faith is not about transforming culture but about personal decision.
   - The gospel does not prescribe a Christian culture or social program.
   - The church is not a bearer of culture but a community of proclamation.
   - The eschatological message relativizes all cultural achievements.
   - "Christian faith is not a religion at all, but an existential decision." ("Faith and Understanding")

4. **Present Eschatological Reality**
   - Eschatology is realized in the present encounter with the word.
   - The future is not a temporal event but a new mode of being.
   - The decisive moment is always now, not in a future consummation.
   - The believer lives in the tension of decision, not in anticipation of a worldly end.
   - "Eternal life is not a future event but a present reality." ("Theology of the New Testament")

5. **Critique of Religious Historicism**
   - Rejects attempts to ground faith in historical proofs or events.
   - The resurrection is not a historical fact but a proclamation that demands response.
   - Faith is not assent to doctrine but trust in the word encountered now.
   - The meaning of Christ transcends historical-cultural particularities.
   - "Faith cannot be based on the certainty of historical facts, but only on the word as it addresses us." ("History and Eschatology")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **Christ and culture** in eschatological perspective profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially through his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. His insistence on the primacy of the **kerygma** and the existential decision challenged both traditional eschatology and cultural Christianity. While criticized for severing faith from history and culture, his work remains a touchstone for debates on the relevance of Christian proclamation in the modern world. Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the relationship between **eschatology**, faith, and contemporary existence.
