### ESSAY
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
To speak of Christ and culture in eschatological perspective is to ask how **Christ’s lordship over all things** orders Christian participation in the provisional structures of the *saeculum* in light of the **new creation**. The doctrine belongs formally to **eschatology and public theology**, yet it is governed materially by **Christology and providence**, since the ascended Christ rules history through word and Spirit. It treats the relation of the church to political, economic, artistic, and scientific life under the rubric of the **already and not yet** of the kingdom.

Three framing theses orient the discussion. First, the **eschatological tension** defines the scope of cultural obedience. The kingdom is present in Christ and the Spirit, yet its fullness awaits the *parousia*. Second, the church’s identity is sacramental and missionary as **firstfruits of the age to come**, which relativizes all merely penultimate loyalties while sending the church into the world in love. Third, the world’s orders belong to God’s **good creation and sustaining providence**, even as they are corrupted by sin, which calls forth both grateful use and critical distance. These theses locate the debate among options marked by **two kingdoms**, **sphere sovereignty**, and **nature and grace**.

The dogmatic location requires distinguishing the **cultural mandate** of Genesis 1 from the **Great Commission** of Matthew 28 without sundering them. Humanity remains called to cultivate and guard the earth as image bearers, while the church receives the gospel charge to disciple the nations. Only **union with Christ** in the Spirit can heal culture’s disordered loves, yet providential **common grace** preserves and directs many temporal goods. The question is how these relations are configured under **Christ’s kingship** between Babylon and the New Jerusalem.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
Scripture sets the canonical horizon by juxtaposing Babylon and Zion, present age and age to come. Genesis 1 to 2 grants humanity the *imago Dei* and a mandate to be fruitful and to exercise wise dominion, grounding any theology of **culture as creational vocation**. After the fall, Genesis 3 to 11 narrates the fracture of culture, climaxing in Babel’s proud technics, which God scatters. Yet Jeremiah 29 instructs exiles to build houses and seek the city’s welfare, a template for **diaspora faithfulness** short of assimilation.

The Gospels reveal that the kingdom is inaugurated in Jesus. In Mark 1 the kingdom draws near, and in Matthew 5 to 7 the Sermon sets the **ethics of the kingdom** that salt and light the earth. John 18 declares a kingdom not from this world, neither derivatively secular nor merely interior. In Matthew 28 the risen Lord claims all authority in heaven and on earth, so the **Great Commission** defines the church’s cultural posture as teaching nations to obey Christ. The Greek *aion* frames the tension of this age and the age to come, while *kainos* in 2 Corinthians 5 names the **new creation** that already breaks in.

Paul describes culture’s ambivalence. Romans 13 calls governing authorities servants of God, a charter for **civil order under providence**, while Revelation 13 exposes beastly empire when power becomes idolatrous. Romans 8 pictures creation groaning toward glory, implying both continuity and transformation of creaturely goods. Colossians 1 announces that in Christ all things hold together and will be reconciled, a cosmic horizon for **Christ’s cosmic lordship**. First Corinthians 7 commends vocation as callings lived before the Lord, while 1 Peter 2 names the church a holy nation that lives as sojourners, a charter for **resident alien** existence.

Apocalyptic texts sharpen the eschatological frame. Galatians 1 calls the present order evil, yet 1 Corinthians 15 anchors confidence in the resurrection of the body and the defeat of death. Revelation 18 to 22 contrasts the fall of Babylon’s luxury with the descent of the **New Jerusalem**, where the kings bring the glory of the nations. The phrase the glory and honor suggests that some purified cultural goods endure. Yet the Lamb’s book and the river of life indicate that all continuities are judged and transfigured by **Christ’s Lordship and Spirit’s renewal**.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
Early Christians negotiated empire as church. In the second and third centuries, writers like Tertullian posed a sharp contrast of **Christ and culture**, while Origen envisioned an intellectual commonwealth under the Logos. The Constantinian shift after 313 produced the Eusebian hope of a Christian empire, while **Augustine’s City of God 413 to 426** articulated the lasting grammar: two cities defined by two loves, mixed until judgment. Augustine honored temporal peace as a real good while insisting that only the heavenly city orders loves rightly. This **Augustinian realism** remains foundational.

Medieval thought refined the relation of **nature and grace**. Pope Gelasius formulated the two swords doctrine of spiritual and temporal powers, while **Aquinas** integrated Aristotle to argue for the perfection of nature by grace. Culture could pursue genuine goods by the light of *lex naturae*, yet it sought supernatural beatitude beyond itself. Christendom ordered society by sacrament and canon, a complex form of **integral Christian humanism**.

The Reformation recast the map. **Luther’s two kingdoms** distinguished God’s right hand of gospel and left hand of law, guarding the freedom of conscience and the legitimacy of vocation. **Calvin’s twofold kingdom** paired a robust doctrine of providence with church discipline, affirming callings under **Christ’s ascension and session**. Anabaptists often refused coercion and swore off magistracy, modeling **radical discipleship** as an alternative politic. Early modern Puritans sought reformation of manners, while Pietists emphasized inward holiness amid public order.

Modernity fractured Christendom. Enlightenment projects relocated authority to reason, while industrial capitalism transformed work and city. In 1898 **Kuyper’s Stone Lectures** declared that there is not a square inch over which Christ does not cry mine, proposing **sphere sovereignty and antithesis**. In 1951 **H. Richard Niebuhr’s Christ and Culture** mapped five types, from Christ against culture to Christ transforming culture, a heuristic that continues to provoke debate. In the later twentieth century, **Moltmann’s Theology of Hope 1964**, liberation theologies after 1968, and postliberal ecclesial politics argued that eschatology reorders the church’s public witness toward **hope, justice, and cruciform power**.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
Old Princeton combined **common sense realism** with **common grace**. **Charles Hodge** defended public use of reason within a theistic order, while **B. B. Warfield** argued for the Spirit’s restraining grace and often affirmed postmillennial expansion of the gospel, a measured **eschatological optimism**. **J. Gresham Machen** warned against cultural Protestantism, yet defended liberty and the legitimacy of learning, exhibiting an Augustinian suspicion paired with **creational affirmation**.

The Dutch Neo Calvinist stream, marked by **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Bavinck**, developed **sphere sovereignty** and **antithesis**. Society consists of differentiated spheres under Christ’s kingship, each with proper norms. Grace does not annihilate nature but renews it, and **regeneration** initiates a cultural ethos that seeks to honor Christ in art, science, and politics. **Bavinck’s organic motif** ties creation and redemption to the eschatological **new earth**, where there is both deep discontinuity due to judgment and real continuity as creation reaches its telos. Later figures like **Dooyeweerd** theorized modal aspects of reality, while **Schilder** accented covenantal antithesis within culture.

The Westminster line shows a spectrum. **Van Til** stressed **antithesis** and the noetic effects of sin, yet maintained defense of culture under common grace. **Meredith Kline** introduced **intrusion ethics**, arguing that the holy sanctions of the theocracy intruded proleptically in Israel and now in the church, not in civil government. This bolstered a **two kingdoms natural law** retrieval in **David VanDrunen** and others, commending pilgrim ethics and constitutional limits to ecclesial authority. In contrast, **theonomy** in **Rushdoony** and **Bahnsen** sought abiding civil application of Mosaic case law, proposing a postmillennial **reconstruction** rejected by mainstream Reformed confessionalism for failing to account for redemptive-historical discontinuity.

Confessional texts show development. The **Westminster Confession 1646 to 1647** affirmed the civil magistrate’s duty concerning religion, with American revisions in 1788 narrowing that claim to protect liberty of conscience. The **Belgic Confession Article 36** underwent similar revision among Dutch Reformed, shifting from establishment to protection. Across these trajectories, the Reformed insist that **Christ’s kingship**, **providence and common grace**, and the **pilgrim church** define cultural discipleship under the **already and not yet**.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
Roman Catholic theology frames culture by **nature and grace**. The neo Thomist **Jacques Maritain** developed integral humanism, while **Henri de Lubac** exposed the modern separation of nature from grace as a distortion, arguing that nature is ordered to the supernatural. **Gaudium et Spes 1965** articulated a hopeful engagement with modern culture while reaffirming the cross. Recent encyclicals, such as **Caritas in Veritate 2009** and **Laudato Si 2015**, extend a **Christocentric humanism** to economics and ecology under **creation’s order and eschatological hope**.

Lutheran thought emphasizes **two kingdoms** and vocation. God rules through law to preserve order and through gospel to save, which guards against confusing civil righteousness with justifying grace. Modern Lutherans like **Bonhoeffer** nuanced orders of creation and responsible action under **Christ’s command**, resisting both quietism and triumphalism. The Lutheran grammar often warns Reformed transformationalists against identity collapse while pressing eschatological humility in **public ethics**.

Modern Protestant voices diversify. **Karl Barth** relocated politics within **Christ’s lordly freedom**, resisting natural law while calling the church to witness. **John Howard Yoder** and **Stanley Hauerwas** advanced an ecclesial politics of the **cross and discipleship**, casting the church as a community that embodies the Sermon on the Mount. **Jürgen Moltmann’s Theology of Hope 1964** set eschatology at the center of praxis for justice, while **liberation theologies** like **Gustavo Gutiérrez 1971** insisted on the poor as a privileged locus of **God’s kingdom**. **Oliver O’Donovan’s Resurrection and Moral Order 1986** retrieved teleology from Easter as normative for **public reason**.

Analytic and philosophical theology have clarified concepts. Discussions of **natural law**, **public reason**, and **moral realism** test whether shared rational goods exist under **common grace**. Some analytic accounts, drawing on **Robert Adams** and others, defend the fittingness of divine commands for finite goods, while evangelical ethicists debate **Augustinian liberalism** and the legitimacy of plural regimes. These analyses sharpen the epistemic and metaphysical premises often assumed in cultural theologies.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
Several flashpoints structure current debate. First is the question of cultural continuity into the eschaton. Does Revelation 21 to 22 teach the translation of **the glory of the nations** into the city, or only a symbolic inclusion of peoples. Neo Calvinists argue for qualified continuity under **new creation**, while apocalyptic readers stress radical discontinuity. The best synthesis affirms that goods as created are good and that all their sinful forms are judged, so any continuity is by **purification under Christ’s judgment**.

Second is the posture of the church in late modern liberal democracies. Some commend **faithful presence** grounded in **common grace** and institutional pluralism, while others counsel a **Benedict Option** of thick local communities with strategic withdrawal. Critics of transformationalism fear triumphalism and civil religion, while critics of withdrawal fear sectarian irrelevance. The **already and not yet** presses toward courage without control, patience without passivity, and hope without illusion.

Third is political theology under nationalism and empire. Augustinian realists warn against **idolatrous nationhood**, while liberationists charge quietism in the face of oppression. A chastened **public theology** seeks legal protections for conscience, justice in criminal and immigration law, and stewardship of creation, while confessing the limits of civil righteousness. Eschatological patience does not erase urgency for **mercy and justice**.

Fourth is technology, bioethics, and ecology. The rise of artificial intelligence, gene editing, and surveillance capitalism tests **cultural mandate** claims. The biblical vision of **Sabbath and limits** and the prophetic critique of Mammon resist technocratic inevitability. Creation care frames ecological action as participation in **God’s reconciling purpose**, neither sacralizing nature nor exploiting it.

Finally, ecclesial form is contested. Missional theology influenced by **Lesslie Newbigin 1989** calls the church to be a sign, instrument, and foretaste of the kingdom in post Christendom. Others stress catechesis, discipline, and liturgy as the primary politics of the church. The deepest objection to every program is that it confuses church and world. The antidote is renewed focus on **word and sacrament**, the **Spirit’s sanctification**, and the confession that Jesus is Lord.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
The doctrine binds loci together. **Theology proper** secures the goal of culture in **divine glory**, while **providence and common grace** sustain penultimate orders. **Christology** centers the **munus triplex** in culture. As prophet, Christ discloses true wisdom that reforms knowledge. As priest, he reconciles enemies and sanctifies vocation. As king, he rules all nations from the **ascension and session**. **Pneumatology** deploys the *missio Dei* through gifts that build up both church and society.

**Anthropology** grounds cultural labor in the *imago Dei*. The image entails relational, royal, and representational functions that are renewed in **union with Christ**. **Hamartiology** names culture’s idolatries as disordered loves that produce structural injustice as well as personal sin. **Soteriology** unites people to Christ for justified freedom and sanctified service, and **ecclesiology** locates the church as a pilgrim people, a **contrast society** that is also leaven within the loaf. **Sacramental theology** gives visible anticipation of the feast to come, forming habits of gratitude and justice.

**Bibliology and moral theology** specify authority for cultural judgment. Scripture’s canonical shape and **Christological center** govern appeals to natural law or prudence. **Eschatology** supplies both hope and horizon. The **resurrection of the body** underwrites an earthy future, while the **judgment of the nations** warns against baptizing any regime. The Trinity’s **perichoretic peace** is the final pattern of social life toward which culture strains and in which it rests.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastors form people for time between the times. Preaching should bind **creation, cross, and new creation**, training theological instincts for penultimate goods and ultimate ends. Catechesis can teach **vocation as discipleship**, reconciling the **cultural mandate** with the **Great Commission**. Public prayers for rulers enact **1 Timothy 2** charity without flattery, while lament gives voice to **exilic hope** amid injustice.

Congregations can cultivate practices that resist idols. **Sabbath rest** counters productivity as salvation. **Eucharistic thanksgiving** schools gratitude and generosity. Fasting challenges consumer liturgies. Shared works of mercy witness to **kingdom righteousness**. Artistic patronage and craft signal the goodness of making, while refusing vanity. Economic discernment under **stewardship and justice** can guide investments and employment toward neighbor love.

Churches should also practice institutional humility. Clear ecclesial boundaries protect **word and sacrament** from capture by parties, while lay vocations engage politics and professions with **prudence and courage**. Partnerships across traditions can advance common goods under **common grace**, while evangelism keeps the center on Christ. The point is neither retreat nor conquest but **faithful presence** as a people of hope.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
Christ’s risen and reigning lordship summons the church to patient, cruciform, and hopeful participation in culture as firstfruits of the **new creation** awaiting the **New Jerusalem**.
