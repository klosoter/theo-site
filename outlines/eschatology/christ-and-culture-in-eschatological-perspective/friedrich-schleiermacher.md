# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the relationship between **Christ and culture** through the lens of **religious consciousness** and the unfolding of **redemption** within history. He saw **eschatology** not as a distant supernatural event but as the progressive realization of the **kingdom of God** within the structures of human society, mediated by the transformative presence of Christ in the community of believers.

- "The Redeemer is the one in whom the divine essence of human nature has appeared in its completeness, and who, by entering into fellowship with Him, awakens the same in others." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Religion as Feeling of Absolute Dependence**
    - Religion is rooted in the immediate self-consciousness of dependence on the infinite.
    - This feeling shapes the individual's orientation toward both God and the world.
    - Culture is the arena in which religious consciousness is expressed and developed.
    - Christ embodies the perfect realization of this God-consciousness within human history.
    - "Religion is to seek this and find it in all that lives and moves, in all growth and becoming." (On Religion)

2. **Christ as the Archetype of God-Consciousness**
    - Christ is not merely a moral teacher but the unique bearer of full God-consciousness.
    - His influence transforms the community, shaping culture toward the divine ideal.
    - The church is the historical continuation of Christ’s God-consciousness in the world.
    - Eschatological hope is realized as this consciousness spreads and deepens.
    - "In Him the divine has become personal and historical." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Eschatology as Historical Development**
    - The **kingdom of God** unfolds progressively within history, not as a sudden apocalyptic event.
    - Cultural and social progress are integral to the eschatological movement.
    - The work of Christ is seen in the moral and spiritual advancement of humanity.
    - Final consummation is the full realization of God-consciousness in all.
    - "The kingdom of God is a community of life, ever advancing, never complete." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Integration of Faith and Culture**
    - Faith is not opposed to culture but seeks its fulfillment and transformation.
    - The church mediates between the spiritual and cultural spheres.
    - Christian ethics are lived out within the context of societal development.
    - The eschatological vision is realized as culture is permeated by Christian ideals.
    - "Christianity is the highest religion because it is the most universal and the most spiritual." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Redemption as Communal and Progressive**
    - Redemption is not only individual but communal, realized in the life of the church.
    - The process of redemption is ongoing, paralleling cultural and historical growth.
    - Christ’s redemptive work is actualized as the community embodies his God-consciousness.
    - The eschaton is the culmination of this communal transformation.
    - "Redemption is the communication of the divine nature to the community." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s vision of **Christ and culture** in eschatological perspective profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in its emphasis on the historical and communal dimensions of redemption. His integration of **religious consciousness** with cultural development paved the way for later liberal and existential theologies. While often critiqued for downplaying supernatural eschatology, his focus on the **kingdom of God** as a present, unfolding reality remains influential in discussions of faith’s role in society and history.
