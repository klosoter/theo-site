# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the relationship of **Christ and culture** through the lens of **redemptive history** and **eschatology**, emphasizing the inaugurated yet not consummated nature of the **kingdom of God**. He insists that Christian engagement with culture must be shaped by the reality of **union with Christ**, the **already/not yet** structure of **eschatological fulfillment**, and the centrality of the **resurrection** as the turning point of the ages.

- "The Christian lives in the overlap of the ages, participating in the new creation while still present in the old." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (in The Glory of the Atonement, ed. Hill & Letham)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology is Central to Christian Existence**
    - The believer’s life is defined by the tension between the **already** inaugurated kingdom and the **not yet** consummation.
    - All of history is oriented toward the final **resurrection** and new creation.
    - Christian hope is grounded in the present reality of **Christ’s resurrection** as the firstfruits.
    - The church’s mission is shaped by this eschatological horizon, not by cultural triumphalism.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event in the history of redemption, inaugurating the eschatological age." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Union with Christ Determines Cultural Engagement**
    - Believers are united to Christ in his death and resurrection, which redefines their relationship to the world.
    - This union is both spiritual and eschatological, marking Christians as participants in the new creation.
    - Cultural activity is not redemptive but is to be conducted in light of the believer’s new identity.
    - The church is the primary locus of new creation life, not broader culture.
    - "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **The Already/Not Yet Structure of Redemptive History**
    - The kingdom of God has been inaugurated but awaits final consummation.
    - Christians live in the tension of overlapping ages, which shapes all cultural and ethical engagement.
    - Cultural transformation is provisional and anticipatory, not ultimate.
    - The fullness of redemption will only be realized at Christ’s return.
    - "The overlap of the ages is the basic framework for understanding the Christian’s place in the world." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **The Church as Eschatological Community**
    - The church is the visible manifestation of the new creation within the present age.
    - Its worship, sacraments, and communal life anticipate the consummated kingdom.
    - The church’s distinctiveness is maintained over against the world’s patterns and values.
    - Engagement with culture is secondary to the church’s primary identity as the people of God.
    - "The church is the eschatological community, the firstfruits of the new creation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Cultural Activity is Subordinate to Redemptive Purposes**
    - Cultural pursuits are legitimate but must be relativized by the priority of redemption.
    - Christians are called to faithful presence, not cultural conquest.
    - The transformation of culture is not the church’s primary mission.
    - All cultural achievements are provisional and await renewal in the new creation.
    - "The Christian’s calling is not to redeem culture but to bear witness to the redemption accomplished in Christ." ("Theonomy and Eschatology")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s eschatological perspective has profoundly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology**, especially in its understanding of the relationship between **Christ and culture**. His emphasis on the **already/not yet** framework has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, particularly at Westminster Theological Seminary. Gaffin’s work continues to challenge triumphalist or transformationalist approaches, calling the church to a pilgrim identity rooted in union with Christ and the hope of the coming kingdom.
