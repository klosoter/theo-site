# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the relationship of **Christ and culture** through the lens of **redemptive history** and **presuppositional apologetics**, insisting that all cultural activity must be interpreted in light of the **eschatological antithesis** between belief and unbelief. He maintained that the consummation in Christ reorients all of life, and that cultural engagement is meaningful only when subordinated to the **lordship of Christ** and the unfolding of the **kingdom of God** in history.

- "There is no neutrality. The antithesis is absolute between the Christian and the non-Christian principle." (Christianity and Culture)

## Key Works

- Christianity and Culture (pamphlet)
- The Defense of the Faith
- Common Grace and the Gospel
- Christian-Theistic Ethics
- Essays on Christian Education

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antithesis Between Belief and Unbelief**
    - Culture is always shaped by underlying **presuppositions** that are either for or against Christ.
    - The **noetic effects of sin** create a fundamental opposition between Christian and non-Christian thought.
    - All cultural products reflect either submission to or rebellion against the **covenant Lord**.
    - The antithesis is not merely theoretical but is worked out in every sphere of life.
    - "There can be no peace between the Christian and the non-Christian principle." (Christianity and Culture)

2. **Eschatological Orientation of Culture**
    - Human history is teleological, moving toward the **consummation in Christ**.
    - Cultural activity has significance only as it participates in the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - The ultimate meaning of culture is found in its relation to the coming **kingdom of God**.
    - Christians are called to live in light of the **already/not yet** of eschatological fulfillment.
    - "All cultural activity must be interpreted in the light of the final victory of Christ." (Common Grace and the Gospel)

3. **Lordship of Christ Over All of Life**
    - Christ’s sovereignty extends to every sphere, including art, science, and politics.
    - There is no legitimate area of neutrality or autonomy from Christ’s rule.
    - Christian engagement with culture is an act of obedience to the **lordship of Christ**.
    - The **cultural mandate** is fulfilled only in union with Christ.
    - "There is no area of life in which the Christian may claim exemption from the authority of Christ." (Essays on Christian Education)

4. **Common Grace and Cultural Engagement**
    - **Common grace** restrains sin and enables cultural cooperation between believers and unbelievers.
    - This cooperation is always provisional and never erases the fundamental antithesis.
    - Common grace serves the purposes of **special grace** and the progress of redemption.
    - Cultural achievements of unbelievers are ultimately accountable to God’s eschatological judgment.
    - "Common grace does not mean common neutrality." (Common Grace and the Gospel)

5. **Presuppositional Critique of Secular Culture**
    - Secular culture is built on **autonomous human reason**, which Van Til rejected.
    - All non-Christian cultural systems suppress the truth of God in unrighteousness.
    - Apologetic engagement must expose the **presuppositional foundations** of culture.
    - The Christian worldview alone provides the basis for true knowledge and cultural renewal.
    - "The Christian must challenge the very foundations of non-Christian culture." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s **presuppositional apologetics** has profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to the relationship between Christ and culture, emphasizing the necessity of viewing all cultural activity through the lens of **redemptive history** and the **eschatological antithesis**. His insistence on the lordship of Christ over every sphere has influenced generations of theologians and apologists, particularly within the Westminster tradition. While some have critiqued his sharp antithesis as overly dualistic, his work remains foundational for those seeking to articulate a robustly Reformed and eschatologically oriented theology of culture.
