# Craig A. Carter (1961– )

Craig A. Carter approaches the relationship between **Christ and culture** through a robustly **eschatological lens**, emphasizing the primacy of **Christ’s lordship** over all creation and the ultimate fulfillment of culture in the **consummation of the kingdom of God**. He critiques both accommodationist and triumphalist models, advocating for a **theological retrieval** that grounds cultural engagement in the **doctrine of creation**, **incarnation**, and **eschatology**. Carter insists that Christian cultural activity must be shaped by the hope of the **new creation** and the reality of Christ’s present reign.

- "The church must live as a sign of the coming kingdom, bearing witness to the lordship of Christ over all culture, even as we await the renewal of all things." (Interpreting Scripture with the Great Tradition)
