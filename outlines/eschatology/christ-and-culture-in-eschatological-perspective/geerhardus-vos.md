# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached the relationship of **Christ and culture** through the lens of **redemptive history** and **eschatology**, emphasizing the unfolding of God's kingdom in history and its consummation in Christ. He argued that the **already/not yet** structure of **eschatological fulfillment** shapes the Christian's engagement with culture, as believers live between the inauguration and consummation of the new creation. Vos maintained that cultural activity is meaningful within the context of **union with Christ** and the anticipation of the **eschatological kingdom**.

- "The kingdom of God is the supreme redemptive gift, and all other gifts are subordinate to it." (The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church)

## Key Works

- The Pauline Eschatology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church
- "Eschatology of the Psalter" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology is central to biblical revelation**
    - Eschatology is not an appendix but foundational to the entire biblical narrative.
    - The Old Testament anticipates the **consummation** realized in Christ.
    - The New Testament presents the **kingdom of God** as both present and future.
    - All of history moves toward the final **eschatological goal** in Christ.
    - "Eschatology precedes soteriology in the order of revelation." (The Pauline Eschatology)

2. **The Kingdom of God is inaugurated and consummated in Christ**
    - Christ's first coming inaugurates the kingdom; its fullness awaits his return.
    - Believers live in the tension of the **already/not yet**.
    - Cultural engagement is shaped by the reality of the kingdom's presence and future.
    - The church embodies the kingdom in the present age.
    - "The kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope." (The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church)

3. **Redemptive history structures Christian engagement with culture**
    - God's acts in history provide the framework for understanding culture.
    - The progress of **revelation** and redemption guides Christian vocation.
    - Cultural activity is meaningful as it participates in God's redemptive purposes.
    - The ultimate transformation of culture awaits the new creation.
    - "The history of redemption is the key to the understanding of all history." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Union with Christ determines the believer’s relationship to the world**
    - Believers are united to Christ in his death and resurrection.
    - This union reorients their identity and cultural pursuits.
    - Christian life is lived out in anticipation of the **eschatological renewal**.
    - Engagement with culture is marked by both participation and distinction.
    - "The believer’s life is hid with Christ in God, awaiting manifestation in glory." (The Pauline Eschatology)

5. **The new creation is the ultimate horizon for culture**
    - The present world is provisional, awaiting transformation.
    - Cultural achievements are significant but not ultimate.
    - The hope of the **new heavens and new earth** relativizes all earthly pursuits.
    - Christian cultural activity anticipates and witnesses to the coming renewal.
    - "The world to come is the true home of the Christian." (The Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s **biblical-theological method** has profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to the relationship between Christ and culture, especially in eschatological perspective. His emphasis on the **already/not yet** structure of the kingdom has influenced generations of theologians in understanding the provisional and anticipatory nature of Christian cultural engagement. Vos’s insights continue to inform contemporary discussions on how believers live faithfully in the world while awaiting the consummation of all things in Christ.
