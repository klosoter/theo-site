# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—present a unified Reformed stance on the relationship between **Christ and culture** within an **eschatological** framework. These confessions emphasize the **sovereignty of Christ** over all creation, the **already/not yet** character of the kingdom, and the call for believers to live as **pilgrims** in anticipation of the **consummation** of all things, while faithfully engaging the world according to God’s law.

- "We look for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 27, 36, and 37
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 31, 52, 123, 123
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Head V, Article 15
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- Lyle D. Bierma, "The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism: A Reformation Synthesis"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Sovereignty Over All Creation**
   - Christ is confessed as the eternal King who rules both church and world.
   - All earthly authorities are subject to Christ’s lordship.
   - The church is called to witness to Christ’s reign in every sphere of life.
   - Cultural engagement is grounded in Christ’s cosmic authority.
   - "He is our eternal King, who governs us by His Word and Spirit, and who defends and preserves us in the enjoyment of that salvation He has purchased for us." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 31)

2. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
   - The kingdom of God is present in part, but awaits final consummation.
   - Believers live in the tension between present realities and future hope.
   - Cultural endeavors are meaningful but provisional.
   - The fullness of redemption will be revealed at Christ’s return.
   - "We expect that great day with a most ardent desire, to the end that we may fully enjoy the promises of God in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

3. **Pilgrim Identity in the World**
   - Christians are called to live as strangers and exiles on earth.
   - The church’s primary citizenship is in heaven, shaping its cultural posture.
   - Engagement with culture is marked by both participation and separation.
   - The hope of the new creation motivates faithful living amid present trials.
   - "We must patiently wait for the right time, with a fervent desire, to be taken to the place where Christ is." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 52)

4. **Cultural Mandate Under God’s Law**
   - Human vocation in culture is affirmed as part of God’s good creation.
   - The law of God provides the norm for cultural activity.
   - Believers are to seek justice, promote good, and oppose evil in society.
   - Cultural engagement is an expression of gratitude for redemption.
   - "He also preserves and governs them by His eternal providence and infinite power, for the service of mankind, to the end that man may serve his God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 12)

5. **Consummation and Final Judgment**
   - History is moving toward the return of Christ and the renewal of all things.
   - The final judgment will vindicate the righteous and condemn the wicked.
   - The hope of resurrection shapes the church’s cultural witness.
   - The ultimate transformation of culture awaits the eschaton.
   - "Christ will cast all His and my enemies into everlasting condemnation, but will take me and all His chosen ones to Himself into heavenly joy and glory." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 52)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to the relationship between **Christ and culture**, especially in their eschatological orientation. Their articulation of the **already/not yet** kingdom and the pilgrim identity of believers has influenced generations of theologians and church communities. These confessions continue to provide a robust framework for engaging cultural issues with both hope and realism, rooted in the expectation of Christ’s return and the renewal of all things.
