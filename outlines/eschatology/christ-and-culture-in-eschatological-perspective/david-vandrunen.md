# David VanDrunen (1971– )

David VanDrunen articulates a distinctive approach to **Christ and culture** by emphasizing the **two kingdoms doctrine** and the **eschatological distinction** between the present age and the age to come. He maintains that while Christians are called to live faithfully within the structures of **common grace**, their ultimate allegiance is to the **heavenly kingdom** inaugurated by Christ and consummated at his return.

- "The Christian’s ultimate hope is not in transforming the present world order but in the coming of the new creation." (Living in God’s Two Kingdoms)

## Key Works

- Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms: A Study in the Development of Reformed Social Thought
- Politics after Christendom: Political Theology in a Fractured World
- Divine Covenants and Moral Order: A Biblical Theology of Natural Law
- A Biblical Case for Natural Law

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Kingdoms Doctrine**
   - Distinguishes between the **common kingdom** (shared with unbelievers) and the **redemptive kingdom** (the church).
   - Argues that cultural activities belong to the common kingdom, governed by **natural law**.
   - Sees the church as an embassy of the eschatological kingdom, with a unique spiritual mission.
   - Maintains that Christians participate in both kingdoms but must not confuse their roles.
   - "God rules the world in two fundamentally different ways, through the common kingdom and the redemptive kingdom." (Living in God’s Two Kingdoms)

2. **Eschatological Tension**
   - Emphasizes the "already/not yet" reality of the **kingdom of God**.
   - Argues that cultural transformation is not the church’s primary mission in this age.
   - Teaches that the fullness of redemption awaits the **consummation** at Christ’s return.
   - Encourages Christians to live as "sojourners and exiles" in the present world.
   - "Our cultural labors are significant, but they are not redemptive in the ultimate sense." (Living in God’s Two Kingdoms)

3. **Natural Law and Common Grace**
   - Affirms that **natural law** provides a moral order for all humanity.
   - Sees **common grace** as God’s provision for societal order and cooperation.
   - Argues that Christians share cultural life with non-Christians on the basis of natural law.
   - Rejects the idea that cultural engagement is uniquely Christian in character.
   - "Natural law is the moral standard by which God governs the common kingdom." (Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms)

4. **Church as Eschatological Community**
   - Views the church as the visible manifestation of the **heavenly kingdom** on earth.
   - Maintains that the church’s primary calling is to proclaim the gospel and administer the sacraments.
   - Warns against politicizing or culturalizing the church’s mission.
   - Sees the church as a foretaste of the new creation, distinct from broader cultural endeavors.
   - "The church is the community of the age to come, set apart from the world." (Living in God’s Two Kingdoms)

5. **Pilgrim Ethic**
   - Calls Christians to live faithfully in the world without seeking to establish a Christian culture.
   - Emphasizes humility, patience, and hope in the midst of cultural pluralism.
   - Encourages responsible participation in society while recognizing its provisional nature.
   - Grounds Christian ethics in the anticipation of the **new creation** rather than present transformation.
   - "We are pilgrims whose citizenship is in heaven, awaiting a city that is to come." (Living in God’s Two Kingdoms)

## Legacy and Impact

VanDrunen’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **Reformed social thought**, especially regarding the relationship between **Christ and culture**. His articulation of the two kingdoms doctrine has sparked renewed debate about the church’s role in society and the limits of cultural engagement. While some praise his clarity and biblical grounding, others critique his approach as overly dualistic. Nonetheless, his emphasis on eschatological hope and the distinctiveness of the church continues to influence Reformed theology and practice.
