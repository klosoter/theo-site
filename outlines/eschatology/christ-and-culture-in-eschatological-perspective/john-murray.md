# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray addressed the relationship of **Christ and culture** through the lens of **redemptive history** and **eschatology**, emphasizing the abiding significance of Christ’s lordship over all creation. He argued that the **kingdom of God** is inaugurated in Christ but awaits consummation, shaping the Christian’s engagement with culture as both present and future-oriented. Murray’s approach highlights the **antithesis** between the church and the world, while affirming the legitimate, though provisional, value of cultural activity in light of the coming **new creation**.

- "The kingdom of God is present wherever the lordship of Christ is acknowledged, but its full manifestation awaits the eschatological consummation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Tension: Already/Not Yet**
   - The **kingdom** is inaugurated in Christ but not yet consummated.
   - Christians live in the tension between present realities and future hope.
   - Cultural engagement is provisional, anticipating the final renewal.
   - The church’s witness points forward to the eschatological fulfillment.
   "The kingdom of God is both present and future, realized and yet to be realized." (Principles of Conduct)

2. **Lordship of Christ Over All Spheres**
   - Christ’s authority extends to every area of life, including culture.
   - No realm is religiously neutral; all are subject to Christ’s reign.
   - Christian cultural activity is an expression of obedience to Christ.
   - The church must model submission to Christ’s comprehensive lordship.
   "There is no sphere of life exempt from the claims of Christ’s sovereignty." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Antithesis Between Church and World**
   - The church and the world are fundamentally distinct in orientation.
   - Cultural pursuits are marked by the effects of sin and common grace.
   - Christians must maintain spiritual separation while engaging culture.
   - The antithesis is eschatologically resolved in the new creation.
   "The church is called to be holy, set apart from the world’s pattern." (Principles of Conduct)

4. **Legitimacy and Limits of Cultural Activity**
   - Cultural activity is a legitimate sphere for Christian involvement.
   - Such activity is always under the judgment and hope of eschatology.
   - Christians should seek the welfare of society without ultimate trust in cultural progress.
   - The value of culture is provisional, not ultimate, in God’s redemptive plan.
   "Culture has its place, but it is not the ultimate end for which man was created." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Hope in the New Creation**
   - The final goal is the renewal of all things in Christ.
   - Present cultural efforts anticipate and point toward the new creation.
   - Eschatological hope relativizes all earthly achievements.
   - The Christian’s ultimate allegiance is to the coming kingdom.
   "The Christian hope is fixed upon the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s eschatological perspective on **Christ and culture** has shaped Reformed discussions by emphasizing the tension between the present age and the age to come. His insistence on the **lordship of Christ** over all of life provided a theological foundation for Christian engagement with culture that avoids both triumphalism and withdrawal. Murray’s careful articulation of the **already/not yet** framework continues to influence contemporary Reformed theology, especially in debates about the church’s role in society and the significance of cultural activity in light of eschatological hope.
