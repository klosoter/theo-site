# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached the relationship of **Christ and culture** through the lens of **eschatology**, emphasizing the ordered integration of **nature and grace**. He taught that while **temporal society** and its cultural achievements are good and ordained by God, their ultimate fulfillment is found in the **beatific vision** and the consummation of all things in Christ. Aquinas thus frames cultural engagement as subordinate to, yet genuinely participating in, the **eschatological kingdom**.

- "Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.8 ad 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially III, q.49–59; I-II, q.90–114)
- Summa Contra Gentiles (Book IV)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- De Regno (On Kingship)
- Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Nature and Grace Ordered Toward Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Human nature is inherently good but finds its perfection only through grace.
    - Culture and society are legitimate expressions of human nature.
    - Grace elevates and completes the natural order without abolishing it.
    - The ultimate end of both individuals and societies is union with God.
    - "The ultimate beatitude of man consists in the use of his highest function, which is the operation of his intellect in the vision of God." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.3, a.8)

2. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Human Culture**
    - Christ embodies the perfection of human nature and culture.
    - The Incarnation sanctifies and redirects cultural pursuits toward God.
    - All human achievements find their true meaning in Christ.
    - The eschatological reign of Christ brings all things to their intended end.
    - "Christ is the head of the Church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence." (Summa Theologiae III, q.8, a.1)

3. **Temporal and Eternal Orders Distinct but Related**
    - The temporal (political/cultural) order is real and governed by reason.
    - The eternal order is supernatural and concerns salvation.
    - Temporal goods are genuine but subordinate to eternal goods.
    - The two orders are harmonized in the eschaton, not collapsed into one.
    - "Earthly happiness is not the ultimate end of man, but is ordered to the happiness of heaven." (Summa Contra Gentiles III, ch.50)

4. **The Role of Law in Shaping Culture Toward the Good**
    - Human law derives from natural law, which is rooted in eternal law.
    - Law guides culture toward justice and virtue.
    - The fulfillment of law is found in charity, which is eschatological.
    - The law prepares for and points beyond itself to the kingdom of God.
    - "The law of the Gospel is the grace of the Holy Spirit given to those who believe in Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.106, a.1)

5. **The Beatific Vision as the Eschatological Goal**
    - The highest good is the direct vision of God in the life to come.
    - All cultural and temporal goods are penultimate, not ultimate.
    - The beatific vision is possible only through Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Eschatological hope shapes present cultural engagement.
    - "Final and perfect happiness can consist in nothing else than the vision of the Divine Essence." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.3, a.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **nature and grace** has profoundly shaped Christian thought on the relationship between Christ and culture, especially in the context of **eschatology**. His vision of cultural life as genuinely good yet ultimately ordered to the **beatific vision** remains foundational for Catholic social teaching and continues to influence Reformed and Protestant discussions. Aquinas’s nuanced distinction between the temporal and eternal orders provides a lasting framework for engaging culture without collapsing it into the kingdom of God. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the transformation and fulfillment of culture in Christ.
