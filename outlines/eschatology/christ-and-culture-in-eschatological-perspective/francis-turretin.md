# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin approached the relationship of **Christ and culture** through the lens of **Reformed scholasticism**, emphasizing the distinction yet ordered relationship between the **two kingdoms** (spiritual and civil) and the ultimate consummation of all things in **eschatology**. He maintained that while the **church** and **state** have distinct roles, both are under the sovereign reign of **Christ**, whose redemptive work will culminate in the restoration of creation at the end of the age.

- "The kingdom of Christ is spiritual and does not overthrow the civil order, but perfects it in its own way." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Catechism of the Christian Religion
- Selected Questions on the State and Office of the Church (various disputations within the Institutes)
- Secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Kingdoms Distinction**
    - Asserts a clear distinction between the **spiritual kingdom** (church) and the **civil kingdom** (state).
    - Both kingdoms are ordained by God but serve different purposes in the present age.
    - The church is governed by **spiritual means**; the state by **civil law**.
    - The eschatological fulfillment will see both realms united under Christ’s consummate reign.
    - "The spiritual kingdom of Christ does not destroy the civil, but perfects and directs it." (Institutes, 18.29.2)

2. **Christ’s Mediatorial Kingship**
    - Christ reigns as **mediator** over the church in a special, redemptive sense.
    - His rule over the nations is providential, distinct from his redemptive kingship.
    - The fullness of Christ’s kingship will be revealed at the **eschaton**.
    - The church’s mission is spiritual, not to transform culture by force.
    - "Christ is king of the church in a special way, but of the world in a general way." (Institutes, 14.13.6)

3. **Eschatological Consummation of Culture**
    - The present cultural order is provisional and awaits renewal.
    - Human vocations and cultural activities have value but are not ultimate.
    - The **new creation** will see the restoration and perfection of all things in Christ.
    - Eschatology provides hope and direction for cultural engagement.
    - "The restoration of all things will be completed at the resurrection, when Christ delivers the kingdom to the Father." (Institutes, 20.6.5)

4. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - Maintains a sharp distinction between the **moral law** (guiding civil life) and the **gospel** (redemptive message).
    - The law orders society; the gospel transforms hearts.
    - The church must not confuse its spiritual mission with civil reform.
    - The eschatological hope is grounded in the gospel, not law-keeping.
    - "The law restrains outward actions; the gospel changes the heart." (Institutes, 11.24.6)

5. **Providence and Common Grace**
    - God’s providence sustains all cultural endeavors, even among the unregenerate.
    - **Common grace** allows for societal order and cultural achievements.
    - These temporal goods are not salvific but serve God’s broader purposes.
    - The final renewal will distinguish between what is passing and what endures in Christ.
    - "God’s providence extends to all, but saving grace is reserved for the elect." (Institutes, 6.2.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful articulation of the **two kingdoms** doctrine and his eschatological orientation have profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to the relationship between Christ and culture. His influence is evident in later Reformed theology, especially in discussions of the church’s mission and the limits of cultural transformation. By grounding cultural engagement in the hope of the **new creation**, Turretin provided a framework that resists both cultural withdrawal and triumphalism, emphasizing the ultimate sovereignty of Christ over all things.
