# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s approach to **Christ and culture** is fundamentally shaped by his **eschatological vision** of the **two cities**: the **City of God** and the **earthly city**. He sees the Christian’s engagement with culture as marked by pilgrimage, tension, and hope, as believers live as citizens of both realms but ultimately await the consummation of all things in Christ. Augustine’s theology frames cultural activity within the unfolding drama of **redemption** and the final **judgment**.

- "Thus the earthly city glories in itself, the Heavenly City glories in the Lord." (City of God, XIV.28)

## Key Works

- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- Confessions
- On Christian Doctrine (De Doctrina Christiana)
- Letters (Epistulae)
- Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia (ed. Allan D. Fitzgerald)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Two Cities: Earthly and Heavenly**
    - Human society is divided between the **City of God** (those who love God) and the **earthly city** (those who love self).
    - These cities are intermixed in history but have different ultimate destinies.
    - The **City of God** is oriented toward eternal peace and communion with God.
    - The **earthly city** seeks temporal peace and earthly goods.
    - "Two loves have made two cities: love of self, even to contempt of God; love of God, even to contempt of self." (City of God, XIV.28)

2. **Pilgrimage and Eschatological Tension**
    - Christians are **pilgrims** in this world, journeying toward their true home.
    - The present age is marked by tension between the already and not yet of **redemption**.
    - Cultural engagement is provisional, shaped by hope in the coming **kingdom**.
    - The fullness of peace and justice is only realized in the eschaton.
    - "We are saved by hope; but hope that is seen is not hope." (City of God, XIX.4)

3. **Common Grace and Use of Culture**
    - God’s providence allows for **common goods** shared by believers and unbelievers.
    - Christians may use the resources of culture for godly purposes.
    - The arts, sciences, and civil order have value but are not ultimate.
    - All cultural achievements are relativized by the coming **judgment**.
    - "Let every good and true Christian understand that wherever truth may be found, it belongs to his Master." (On Christian Doctrine, II.18)

4. **Christ as the Fulfillment of History**
    - **Christ** is the center and goal of all history.
    - The incarnation inaugurates the final stage of God’s redemptive plan.
    - All cultural and historical developments are ordered toward Christ’s reign.
    - The consummation will reveal the true meaning of history and culture.
    - "He is the end to which we tend, and in reaching Him we find our rest." (City of God, XIX.1)

5. **Judgment and the Transformation of Culture**
    - At the **final judgment**, the destinies of the two cities are revealed.
    - Earthly achievements are tested and only those oriented to God endure.
    - The **City of God** is perfected, while the earthly city passes away.
    - Eschatology relativizes all cultural loyalties and ambitions.
    - "The earthly city, which shall not be everlasting... shall be consigned to final punishment." (City of God, XV.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s vision of **Christ and culture** in eschatological perspective has profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, especially in the **Reformed tradition**. His doctrine of the **two cities** provides a foundational framework for understanding the Christian’s dual citizenship and the provisional nature of cultural engagement. Augustine’s insights continue to inform debates on the relationship between church and society, the limits of earthly politics, and the ultimate hope of the **kingdom of God**.
