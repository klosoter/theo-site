### ESSAY
To bring Christ and culture under an eschatological perspective is to ask how the crucified, risen, and ascended Lord rules the present age and how that rule shapes Christian participation in the making and maintenance of human life. Culture names the arts, institutions, laws, and practices by which a people orders life toward perceived goods. Eschatological perspective names the conviction that in Christ the age to come has invaded the present age, so that all culture is now situated between the decisive victory and the final consummation. The Christian is thus a citizen of two cities, a participant in two economies of divine action, and an agent whose labors are penultimate signs that anticipate judgment and renewal rather than instruments that engineer the kingdom. The thesis I defend is a pilgrim transformationalism: Christ’s lordship is comprehensive and culture is not neutral, but the kingdom’s mode of advance is ecclesial and sacramental, animated by **common grace** and bounded by **natural law**, so that cultural engagement is real and hopeful yet chastened by **already–not yet** eschatology and the discipline of the cross.

Augustine’s City of God reframed the long future of the church after the sack of Rome by disentangling the fate of the civitas Dei from any empire and by locating politics within a theology of love ordered to the final vision of God. Writing in the aftermath of 410, Augustine confronted the pagan charge that Christianity had weakened Rome. His method was historical and doctrinal, reading the history of the world through the biblical narrative of two cities constituted by two loves. The earthly city is ordered by love of self even to contempt of God, the heavenly city by love of God even to contempt of self. Augustine’s conceptual contribution is not a dualism of space but an eschatological distinction of ends. The two cities intermingle in the saeculum, share a common use of temporal goods, and pursue the tranquility of order. The pilgrims of the heavenly city use the peace of Babylon for the sake of their journey, seek the welfare of the earthly city, and practice an ordo amoris that refuses to absolutize any temporal polity. Augustine’s just war reflections are extensions of this eschatological charity for the neighbor’s temporal good under the conditions of the fall. The debates he shaped include whether the two cities map onto two institutions, church and state, and whether his account licenses quietism. The better reading is that the two cities are eschatological communities with overlapping memberships now. The pilgrim duties are robust: to seek the earthly peace as a penultimate good, to improve customs and laws insofar as they serve order and charity, and to submit to rulers as ordained by God while refusing idolatrous ultimate hope. Augustine’s genius is to show that eschatology does not evacuate culture of value but relativizes it to its proper end.

H. Richard Niebuhr’s Christ and Culture is not a doctrine but a map. The five types he named Christ against culture, Christ of culture, Christ above culture, Christ and culture in paradox, and Christ the transformer of culture have become the default grammar of this discussion. His aim was descriptive, with a modern ecumenical confidence in cultural engagement. The typology’s utility lies in reminding examiners that no single slogan captures the biblical complexity. Yet its flaws are instructive. The types slip into moral psychological portraits rather than theological judgments. The categories blur crucial distinctions between creation as good and culture as ambiguous, between redemption’s ecclesial shape and broader providence, and between eschatological timing and present practice. A Reformed Augustinian reading must refuse the impulse to choose a type rather than to adjudicate the theological claims that render some modes of engagement faithful and others idolatrous. Niebuhr is decisive because he set the terms that must be corrected: the question is not whether Christ transforms culture but when, how, and by what means in light of the resurrection and the promised appearing.

Abraham Kuyper, preaching to a modernizing Netherlands and delivering his Stone Lectures at Princeton, argued that Calvinism is not merely soteriology but a life system. His method, drawing on Reformed dogmatics and cultural observation, pressed two axioms that have shaped modern Reformed thought. First, the antithesis. Regeneration reorders the heart and thus the direction of cultural labor. There is no **neutrality** of reason or institutions, because the religious root of the person bends all cultural life toward God or idols. Second, **common grace**. God restrains sin and preserves creation after the fall, enabling real cultural development among the unregenerate and real cooperation among citizens. These two axioms ground **sphere sovereignty**, a doctrine of differentiated authorities. God’s sovereignty expresses itself through distinct spheres family, church, state, academy, art each with its proper law and competence. The state is not the soul of the nation but the guardian of public justice. The church has its unique means of grace. Culture flourishes when spheres respect their limits and when Christians inhabit them with confessionally shaped norms. Kuyper catalyzed an enduring debate. Does his vision collapse into triumphalism, baptizing a Christian party and conflating church and culture under the banner of transformation. Or does it sustain real pluralism under the lordship of Christ in which Christian institutions contribute without coercion. The answer depends on how one integrates his axioms with a biblical eschatology. Kuyper himself warned that common grace is not redemptive grace and that the church’s unique mandate is not supplanted by cultural labor. The antithesis prevents a naive appeal to **natural law** as if a raw nature persisted untouched by the fall, yet common grace prevents sectarian isolation and licenses shared projects. The Kuyperian core we must preserve is **sphere sovereignty** as a curb on sacralized politics and an architecture for principled pluralism, combined with an antithetical posture that keeps the church from absorbing the world’s plausibility structures.

Geerhardus Vos anchors the eschatological perspective through biblical theology. His Pauline Eschatology and his Reformed Dogmatics made two decisive claims. First, eschatology is not a terminal addendum but the warp and woof of revelation. The kingdom anticipated by the prophets is inaugurated in Christ’s resurrection and Pentecost. Second, the presence of the Spirit is the down payment of the age to come, so that the church is the bearer of eschatological life now. This **already–not yet** structure reframes Christ and culture. The church is the locus of new creation, gathered under the prophetic word, nourished by the sacraments, and shaped by the communion of saints. The structures of the world are not the kingdom, yet they are not abandoned to chaos. They are the field of mission and service, under **providence** and **common grace**, in which the saints practice hope. Vos’s biblical-theological method resists two errors. He resists an over-realized eschatology that identifies the kingdom with political programs and a timeless naturalism that locates moral order apart from redemptive history. The examiner will press here. Does inaugurated eschatology obliterate **natural law**. Vos’s answer is no. Creation order persists, sustained by God. The law written on the heart remains, clarified and deepened by redemptive revelation. But the witness of the church to that order is never detachable from the cross and resurrection. Thus the Christian stance toward culture remains cruciform, marked by patience and martyrial readiness rather than domination.

Meredith Kline extends Vos by clarifying the covenants that structure culture. Kline’s reading of the Old Testament emphasized **federal theology** and typology. The Noahic covenant is his key for public life. After the flood God covenants with all flesh to preserve the world until the end. This is a regime of **common grace** and common justice, not redemptive grace. The Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants are redemptive administrations. Israel’s theocracy is a typological **intrusion** of the final judgment into history. The civil retribution and holy war that belong to the theocracy are not normative for the common kingdom. With the cutting off of the theocracy and the exile, the people of God return to the ordinary mode of pilgrimage. The implications for Christ and culture are sharp. We must not confuse Israel’s civil law with the ordinary patterns of civil justice in the nations. We must not import holy war logics into politics. And we must not deny that in Christ the church now is the holy nation whose weapons are the word, prayer, and sacrament. Kline guards against a triumphalist theonomy and secures a theology of exile that still embraces civic responsibility. The state has a real mandate under **natural law** to punish evil and praise good. The church has a distinct mandate to make disciples and to teach the commands of Christ. The Christian can serve in both registers without collapsing them.

Oliver O’Donovan reframes the moral field by anchoring authority in the resurrection. He argues that the resurrection is the public vindication of Jesus and the reauthorization of created order under the last Adam. Political authority is not obliterated by Christ’s lordship but reordered in light of the gift of judgment entrusted to the risen one. The present rule of Christ means that rulers are accountable to the judgment that has been revealed. The mission of the church is to proclaim that judgment and to form a people whose practices anticipate the right order of love that will obtain at the end. O’Donovan thus retrieves **natural law** within a decidedly eschatological horizon, refusing to detach creation from redemption and insisting that public reasoning can be called to acknowledge what God has made and what God has done in Christ. His sympathetic yet critical account of Christendom matters here. Christendom was a political settlement in which the gospel shaped legal and social order. Its failures were many. Its core insight was that the resurrection is public truth. Post-Christendom does not entail privatization. It requires discerning how to witness to public truth without juridically monopolizing the public sphere. The examiner may press whether O’Donovan slides back into sacral politics. The proper answer is that O’Donovan limits the church’s coercive claims. The church speaks with the authority of proclamation. The prince bears the sword but is called to attend to the authority of the risen Christ. That call is not a demand for confessional coercion but a summons to justice answered in the grammar of prudence and law.

These figures establish the conditions for a constructive position. The internal Reformed debates revolve around the integration of Kuyper and Kline under the governance of Vos and the retrieval of Augustine. Kuyperians emphasize **sphere sovereignty**, cultural development, Christian institutions, and the possibility of authentic redirection of scholarship and art. Two-kingdoms advocates, often drawing from Kline and Luther, emphasize the distinct mandates of church and state, the danger of sacralizing culture, and the order of **natural law**. The way forward is not to select one and reject the other but to delimit each by eschatology. The antithesis is real, yet its force is not to sever all common rationality but to expose idolatrous loves and to drive to Christ. **Natural law** is real, yet its use is not to bypass gospel proclamation but to guide public prudence in the common realm. **Common grace** is real, yet it is not saving. The church’s task is irreducible; no cultural labor can replace Word and sacrament. But cultural labor is nontrivial; it is obedience to the creation mandate under the Noahic covenant, redirected by the Great Commission’s pedagogy that teaches the nations to observe whatsoever Christ commanded. This implies a limited but genuine transformation. When Christians order their work and institutions by the law of God illumined by the gospel, they bear anticipatory signs of the kingdom. These signs are not the kingdom itself, but they adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.

The external debates sharpen the edges. Liberal privatization demands that faith retreat to the interior. Augustine and O’Donovan answer that the resurrection is a public fact. The confession Jesus is Lord is not a private preference but a claim about reality. It does not demand coercive imposition but cannot be domesticated to inwardness. Anabaptist withdrawal, exemplified by Yoder’s Politics of Jesus, warns against Constantinian compromise. The warning is salutary. The cross must discipline power. Yet Yoder often renders civil authority unintelligible except as fallen violence, and he misses the positive reference to the magistrate in Romans 13 and the prophetic vocation to call rulers to justice. A Reformed Augustinianism honors the political as a good of the saeculum and the church’s martyrial readiness. Roman Catholic integralism seeks to reunite altar and throne under a theology of perfect society and the subordination of temporal ends to spiritual ends. The Reformed answer is that the subordination of ends is real in the order of love but not in the juridical structure of the saeculum after the cutting off of the theocracy. Israel’s typological polity was unique. The ordinary order of the nations is preserved and judged, not absorbed, by the church. An integralist will protest that this bifurcation loosens the claims of Christ on public life. The correct response is that the claims are total but their enforcement is eschatological and their present manifestation is through persuasion, law’s ordinary authority, and ecclesial discipline, not state coercion of faith.

Contemporary challenges test whether this framework has traction. In pluralist democracies, the question is how Christians argue publicly. The answer is to speak both with confessional candor and with public reasons drawn from **natural law**, confident that both are accountable to Christ. On technology and platform power, the Augustinian suspicion of libido dominandi and the Kuyperian insistence on **sphere sovereignty** call for institutional constraints, transparency, and the diffusion of power. On nationalism and post-liberal yearnings for unity, the pilgrim identity resists sacralizing the nation while affirming the limited goods of civic membership. On justice movements, the antithesis exposes counterfeit gospels even as the Noahic commitment to public right obliges Christians to work for the oppressed within the rule of law. On ecological crisis, the creation mandate and **federal theology** require husbanding the earth’s goods, ordered by the humility of creatures awaiting the liberation of creation at the revealing of the sons of God.

To secure doctrinal coherence, we must locate this account within Christology and ecclesiology. Christ exercises the mediatorial kingship promised in Psalm 2 and realized in the resurrection and ascension. As last Adam, he fulfills the cultural mandate and hands the kingdom to the Father at the end. As prophet he reveals a law that clarifies **natural law** and renews the mind. As priest he constitutes a holy people through his death and intercession, a people that is the firstfruits of the new creation. As king he rules all things for the sake of the church and through the church’s ministry extends the obedience of faith among the nations. The Spirit unites believers to Christ and equips them for works of love, embedding them in the communion that is the sign of the world to come. The sacraments enact the grammar of transformation by death and resurrection, training a patience that refuses both cynical resignation and utopian impatience. The eschatological mode of Christ’s reign guards against over-realized pretensions. His kingdom is not from this world as to source, though it is for this world as to scope. It comes through the folly of preaching, not through violence. Yet his rule is not less than political. He is the judge of rulers and the giver of right. The magistrate bears the sword by his appointment and is called to order public life to the good.

It follows that our position must negotiate key objections. First, does a two-kingdoms distinction divide Christ. It does not. It distinguishes the ways the one Christ rules. He governs the common realm through **providence** and **natural law**, preserving space for human society, and he governs the redemptive realm through Word and sacrament, generating the new creation community. This is not two sovereignties but two economies within the one plan. Second, does appeal to **natural law** surrender the antithesis. It does not, because the antithesis is not a denial of created order but a disclosure of moral suppression. The regenerate can help the unregenerate see what they already know by nature, and shared work for public justice is both possible and commanded. Third, does transformational language inevitably collapse into Christendom. Not if we remember Kline’s **intrusion ethics** and Augustine’s ordo amoris. Transformation is the fruit of sanctification expressed in vocations. It is anticipatory sign, not blueprint for the eschaton. Fourth, does a pilgrim posture excuse societal injustice. No. The pilgrim seeks the peace of the city, rebukes injustice, and builds institutions for the vulnerable. Pilgrimage is not passivity but patient courage grounded in the victory of Christ. Fifth, is this position coherent with covenant theology. Yes. The Noahic covenant frames common cultural life, the Abrahamic and new covenants frame the church’s missional identity, and the Mosaic theocracy as type warns us against sacralizing politics. The covenants are not competing plans but successive administrations under the same Lord.

Scripture secures and disciplines the argument. Jeremiah’s call to exiles to seek the city’s welfare describes the eschatological shape of the church between Pentecost and Parousia. Romans 13 affirms the good of civil authority while Revelation unmasks imperial idolatry. John 18 clarifies that Christ’s kingdom is not from the world, which means that its origin and weapons are heavenly though its claims press into every domain. Matthew 28 binds the church to teach all that Christ commanded, which includes the moral law fulfilled in love and rightly used in public life. Colossians 1 declares that all things are created through and for Christ and are being reconciled through the blood of his cross, which secures the ontological scope of his lordship. First Corinthians 7 says the appointed time has grown short, which keeps cultural projects penultimate and frees believers for sacrificial service.

From these threads a constructive directive emerges. Christians should build and reform schools, businesses, and arts according to the law of love, confessing Christ’s name and honoring their neighbors. They should argue for laws that protect life, family, and the poor, appealing to reasons accessible to all and candidly acknowledging their deepest commitments. They should resist the absolutizing of markets and states by defending **sphere sovereignty** and local institutions. They should receive the church’s worship as the center of social existence, for there the future breaks into the present and orders all labor. They should expect suffering and be ready to lose political power rather than deny Christ. And they should hope, for the Lord who reigns now will appear, and the culture into which we labor will be judged and renewed, not discarded. That hope is the only engine for a culture worthy of the name, because it frees us from the panic of needing to secure outcomes and from the despair that nothing matters.

This pilgrim transformationalism equips a Westminster candidate to face examiners on coherence across loci. It preserves **divine simplicity** and the unity of God’s will by distinguishing not God’s being but the historical economies of his action. It maintains **federal theology** by assigning culture to the Noahic frame and church to the new covenant mission. It honors the Trinity in missions by treating cultural life as a domain of the Father’s created order, the Son’s reconciled rule, and the Spirit’s sanctifying presence. It preserves soteriological clarity by refusing to confuse civic righteousness with justifying grace. And it keeps ecclesiology central by insisting that the church is the foretaste of the new creation whose existence is the deepest cultural good of any city.

Examiner pressure should provoke simplicity and steadiness. Are you for Christ against culture or for transformation. The only faithful answer is that we are for Christ and his culture now embodied in the church, and for the relative good of the world’s cultures as they are ordered to justice under **natural law** and as they are leavened by Christian witness, all the while refusing to identify any present order with the kingdom of God. What an eschatological perspective yields is not ambivalence but resolve. It relativizes the world to the coming glory and thereby energizes love in the present. It refuses idolatry of politics and markets and thereby frees courage to work within them. It grounds reproach and martyrdom as victories and frees Christians to lose with integrity. And it provides a generous patience with neighbors even when they reject the gospel, since we know that our labors in the Lord are not in vain and that the judge of all the earth will do right.

### RECAP NOTES
