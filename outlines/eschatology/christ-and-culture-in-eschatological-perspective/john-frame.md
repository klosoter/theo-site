# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the relationship of **Christ and culture** through the lens of **biblical lordship**, emphasizing the comprehensive authority of Christ over all areas of life, including cultural engagement. He situates this relationship within an **eschatological framework**, arguing that believers are called to transform culture in anticipation of the **consummation** of Christ’s kingdom, while recognizing the present tension between the already and not yet.

- "Christians are called to bring every area of life under the lordship of Christ, anticipating the final redemption of all things." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God
- "Toward a Theology of Culture" (in The Collected Shorter Writings of John Frame, Vol. 1)
- "Christ and Culture Revisited" (in The Collected Shorter Writings of John Frame, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Lordship is Comprehensive**
    - Christ’s authority extends to every sphere, including culture, politics, and the arts.
    - There is no sacred-secular divide; all of life is subject to Christ’s rule.
    - Cultural engagement is a matter of obedience to Christ’s commands.
    - The **normative, situational, and existential perspectives** all reflect Christ’s lordship.
    - "There is no area of human life that is neutral with respect to Christ’s lordship." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

2. **Eschatological Tension: Already and Not Yet**
    - The kingdom of God is inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - Christians live in the tension of present transformation and future hope.
    - Cultural efforts are significant but provisional, awaiting final redemption.
    - The church’s mission includes both witness and anticipation of the new creation.
    - "We live between the times, called to serve Christ now while longing for his return." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

3. **Transformational Engagement with Culture**
    - Believers are called to influence and transform culture according to biblical principles.
    - Transformation is rooted in the **regenerating work of the Holy Spirit**.
    - Cultural engagement is not optional but a necessary outworking of faith.
    - The goal is not withdrawal but faithful presence and influence.
    - "Christian ethics demands that we seek to transform culture in light of God’s Word." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Normativity of Scripture for Cultural Engagement**
    - Scripture provides the ultimate standard for evaluating cultural practices.
    - All cultural activity must be tested by the authority of God’s Word.
    - The Bible addresses both individual and societal dimensions of life.
    - The **regulative principle** applies broadly, not just to worship.
    - "The Word of God is the final authority for all of life, including our cultural pursuits." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

5. **Hopeful Realism in Cultural Involvement**
    - Christians should be realistic about the persistence of sin in culture.
    - Cultural transformation will be partial until Christ’s return.
    - Hope is grounded in God’s sovereign purpose and ultimate victory.
    - Engagement is marked by both humility and confidence in God’s promises.
    - "Our hope is not in cultural success, but in the sure promise of Christ’s coming kingdom." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s approach to **Christ and culture** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions by insisting on the comprehensive lordship of Christ and the necessity of cultural engagement grounded in Scripture. His **triperspectivalism** has provided a nuanced framework for evaluating cultural issues from multiple angles. Frame’s eschatological realism encourages believers to labor faithfully in the present while maintaining hope in the final consummation. His work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and laypeople seeking to live out a robustly biblical vision of cultural involvement.
