# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the relationship of **Christ and culture** through the lens of **biblical eschatology**, emphasizing the antithesis between the **common grace order** and the **redemptive kingdom**. He argued that the **cultural mandate** persists but is radically transformed by the inbreaking of the **eschatological kingdom** in Christ, who fulfills and transcends the original creation order. Kline’s covenant theology frames the Christian’s engagement with culture as provisional, awaiting the consummation of all things in the **new creation**.

- "The city of God is not built by the labors of the common grace city but descends from heaven as a gift of God’s sovereign grace." ("Kingdom Prologue")

- Structure of Biblical Authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Kingdoms Distinction**
   - Maintains a sharp distinction between the **common grace order** (civil society) and the **redemptive kingdom** (church).
   - Argues that the **Noahic covenant** provides a temporary, non-redemptive framework for cultural life.
   - Sees the **church** as an eschatological community, distinct from the broader culture.
   - Emphasizes that cultural achievements are not themselves redemptive or preparatory for the kingdom.
   - "The common grace order is not the kingdom of God but a temporary stage in the history of the world." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Eschatological Fulfillment in Christ**
   - Christ is the true fulfillment of the **cultural mandate** and the last Adam.
   - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated in Christ but awaits consummation at his return.
   - Cultural efforts cannot usher in the kingdom; only Christ’s return will consummate it.
   - The church’s mission is primarily redemptive, not cultural transformation.
   - "The kingdom is not the product of human culture but the gift of divine re-creation." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

3. **Covenantal Framework for Culture**
   - Interprets all of history through the progression of **biblical covenants**.
   - The **Noahic covenant** preserves creation for the sake of redemption, not as an end in itself.
   - The **new covenant** community lives as pilgrims, anticipating the new creation.
   - Cultural activities are legitimate but relativized by the coming eschaton.
   - "Covenant history moves inexorably toward the final judgment and new creation." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Typology and Symbolism**
   - Sees Old Testament cultural forms (e.g., city, temple) as **types** pointing to eschatological realities.
   - Earthly culture is provisional and symbolic, not ultimate.
   - The **heavenly city** (New Jerusalem) is the archetype, not a product of human achievement.
   - Typology underscores the discontinuity between present culture and the consummated kingdom.
   - "The typological city anticipates the descent of the true city from heaven." (Images of the Spirit)

5. **Pilgrim Ethic**
   - Christians are called to a **pilgrim existence** within the present age.
   - Engagement with culture is marked by humility, patience, and hope in the coming kingdom.
   - The church’s primary allegiance is to Christ, not to any earthly culture or nation.
   - Cultural involvement is valid but subordinate to the eschatological hope.
   - "The church is a pilgrim people, journeying toward the city whose builder and maker is God." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s robust articulation of the **two kingdoms doctrine** and his eschatological reading of the **cultural mandate** have significantly shaped Reformed discussions on Christ and culture. His covenantal and typological approach has influenced generations of biblical theologians, especially in the Westminster tradition. While some critique his sharp distinction between church and culture, Kline’s work remains a touchstone for understanding the provisional nature of cultural engagement in light of the coming **new creation**.
