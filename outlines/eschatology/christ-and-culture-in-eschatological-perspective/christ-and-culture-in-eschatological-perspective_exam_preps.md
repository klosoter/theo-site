### ESSAY
The phrase “Christ and culture in eschatological perspective” forces together three axes that examiners will probe relentlessly: the identity and reign of Christ, the nature and normativity of culture, and the timing and character of the kingdom in the history of redemption. Unless one’s eschatology is clearly articulated, talk of Christ and culture will oscillate between triumphalist transformationism and pessimistic withdrawal, or else devolve into liberal immanentism in which “kingdom of God” becomes simply a cipher for evolving social ideals. I will argue for a Reformed‑Augustinian position: that the exalted Christ presently reigns over all things according to **providence** while gathering his pilgrim people through the **means of grace**; that culture as a creational and historical reality is good yet radically corrupted; and that in the present age Christians are called to a mode of engagement marked by **eschatological tension**—already participating in the powers of the age to come by the Spirit, yet awaiting the final renewal of creation that no cultural project can engineer.

Any rigorous account must begin with Augustine, whose City of God recasts the entire question by placing culture within a two‑cities, two‑loves, and two‑ends framework. Writing after the sack of Rome, Augustine refuses both pagan nostalgia for empire and Christian despair at Rome’s fall. His decisive move is to read political and cultural history through an eschatological lens: the earthly city, founded on the love of self to the contempt of God, and the heavenly city, founded on the love of God to the contempt of self, are intermixed in saeculo until the last judgment. Cultural achievements—law, rhetoric, architecture, politics—belong formally to the earthly city, yet are ambiguously ordered by divine **providence** to serve the pilgrim city. Augustine’s treatment of “the use of the world” and “the peace of Babylon” shows his subtle stance: Christians seek the earthly peace as a relative good, but only as pilgrims whose ultimate peace lies in the visio Dei. Here an **eschatological reserve** is embedded into his account of culture; no city, even a formally Christian empire, can be identified with the kingdom of God.

Examiners will likely press whether Augustine is merely a proto‑dualistic “two worlds” thinker. The answer must emphasize that his eschatology is neither Plato nor Manichaeism. The problem is not materiality or historical embodiment but disordered love. The heavenly city is not a disembodied realm but the perfected communion of the saints in a renewed creation. Thus, Augustine can affirm a robust doctrine of **creation** and of the **good of temporal order** while refusing to sacralize any culture. His critique of Roman virtue as “splendid vices” anticipates a permanent Christian suspicion of civil righteousness as an adequate realization of the kingdom. At the same time, his theology of common life—shared language, law, and cultural tasks—grounds a rationale for cooperation with unbelievers in seeking a relatively just order.

The Augustinian legacy reverberates in the magisterial Reformation, especially in John Calvin, who must be treated not only as a systematician but as a political and cultural theologian. Calvin stands at the juncture of renewed patristic Augustinianism and the formation of early modern states. In the Institutes and the commentaries he develops a rich doctrine of **common grace** and of the twofold government of God: the spiritual kingdom, by which Christ through his Spirit rules consciences and gathers the church, and the political kingdom, by which God outwardly restrains evil and promotes external righteousness. This is not an ontological split between nature and grace but a functional distinction within the one reign of Christ. Calvin famously insists that even pagan philosophers are “excellent gifts of the Spirit” in the arts and disciplines. The arts and sciences thus participate in the good created order under the Creator’s providential rule, though they are not, as such, instruments of saving grace.

Calvin’s eschatology reinforces this structural account. He underscores the life of the age to come as the true inheritance of the faithful, yet he refuses monasticism or cultural retreat. Instead, he commends ordinary vocations as sites of **sanctification** and service to neighbor under the present reign of Christ. The “two kingdoms” in Calvin are not spaces from which Christ is absent, but distinct modes in which the one Lord exercises his authority now and will manifest it climactically at his return. This allows Calvin to affirm, in an already–not yet idiom, that the civil order is both penultimate and graced. Examiners will likely ask whether this feeds into later Lutheran‑style “two kingdoms” quietism. The best answer is to note that Calvin combines a strong affirmation of civil responsibility, including resistance to tyrants, with an Augustinian refusal to identify any polity with Zion.

Abraham Kuyper, working within the Dutch Reformed tradition, decisively reframes the modern Protestant conversation by coining the famous dictum that there is not a square inch of creation over which Christ does not cry “mine.” His project of **sphere sovereignty** aims to overcome both ecclesiastical domination of culture and state hegemony, instead distributing cultural authority across differentiated spheres such as family, church, state, science, art, and commerce. Kuyper’s Stone Lectures on Calvinism portray Calvinism as a **world‑and‑life view**, a comprehensive religious root that must bear fruit in every area of culture. Theologically, Kuyper radicalizes **common grace** as God’s preserving, restraining, and enabling work in the world after the fall, thereby justifying the relative legitimacy and achievements of non‑Christian cultures.

Kuyper is often read as a straightforward culture‑transformer, especially in Niebuhr’s influential but overly schematic Christ and Culture, where he is slotted into the “Christ the transformer of culture” type. Yet the internal dynamics of Kuyper’s thought are more ambivalent and here the eschatological dimension becomes crucial. On the one hand, Kuyper speaks of the antithesis between regenerate and unregenerate as cutting through all cultural life, generating two sciences, two politics, two artistic directions. On the other hand, he insists that believers and unbelievers cooperate in shared cultural projects under common grace. Without a clear already–not yet eschatology, Kuyperianism can drift either toward triumphalist neocalvinist culturalism, imagining that Christianization of culture effectively realizes the kingdom, or toward sectarian antitheticalism, imagining that all “worldly” culture is essentially Babylon. A Westminster examiner will likely test whether you can affirm Kuyper’s structural insights while correcting these tendencies by subordinating them to a more clearly articulated **inaugurated eschatology**.

To map the modern debate, one must engage Richard Niebuhr, not because his taxonomy is the final word but because it has de facto organized the field in the twentieth century. Niebuhr’s Christ and Culture offers five types: Christ against culture, Christ of culture, Christ above culture, Christ and culture in paradox, and Christ the transformer of culture. This typology, drawing from Tertullian, liberal Protestantism, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, and Calvin plus the Reformed tradition respectively, purports to be descriptive rather than prescriptive. However, Niebuhr subtly commends the “transformer” type, reading history as a narrative of progressive synthesis.

The problem lies in Niebuhr’s underlying liberal historicism. By abstracting “Christ” as an ideal and “culture” as a neutral social process, and by minimizing the eschatological rupture of cross and resurrection, he effectively domesticates the question. The “transformer” model in his hands becomes open to an immanentist hope that culture can be progressively redeemed through moral effort and social reform. In practice this coheres with a realized eschatology where the line between the kingdom of God and Western democratic culture blurs. Reformed and Augustinian critics, including those at Westminster, will object that Niebuhr’s categories flatten the doctrinal substance of Christology and **eschatology** into ideal‑types, so that the politically and socially crucial distinction between this age and the age to come is relativized. A robust eschatological account must say: no typology is adequate that does not register the cruciform judgment on culture and the apocalyptic character of Christ’s parousia.

Oliver O’Donovan offers a more recent and theologically careful account that reintegrates Christ, culture, and eschatology around the event of the resurrection. In works like The Desire of the Nations and Resurrection and Moral Order, O’Donovan argues that Christian ethics and political thought must start from the fact that Jesus is already raised and exalted as king. The resurrection is not merely future hope but a public, historical vindication that reconfigures political authority. He speaks of the “interim” during which the risen Christ rules from the right hand of the Father through the proclamation of the gospel, the **mission of the church**, and the limited, accountable authority of the state. The nations are to be discipled, yet they are not thereby transformed into the church.

O’Donovan’s decisive contribution is to insist that the Christian relation to political and cultural authority is governed by an already–not yet structure: there is a real but provisional participation of earthly authority in the rule of Christ, yet no identification of any order with the eschatological kingdom. He retrieves elements of Christendom as a historical attempt to acknowledge Christ’s authority over public life, but he simultaneously welcomes aspects of post‑Christendom as a purifying of the church’s identity and mission. This nuanced position corrects both the naivety of liberal hopes and the cynicism of certain anabaptist or radical critics. The examiner may push on O’Donovan’s retrieval of Christendom: does it compromise the pilgrim character of the church emphasized by Augustine and the Reformers. The best answer emphasizes that for O’Donovan, Christendom was a historical experiment in political acknowledgment of Christ’s lordship, not an eschatological settlement. Its failures stem partly from forgetting the provisional and ministerial character of civil authority in the interim.

Within these figures we can now articulate the three layers of debate. Internally, within the Augustinian and Reformed traditions, the key disputes center on the nature–grace relation, **two kingdoms** versus **sphere sovereignty**, and the church’s public role. Neo‑Calvinists have often criticized “two kingdoms” views as capitulating to secularization, while “radical two kingdoms” proponents have accused transformationalists of conflating law and gospel and confusing the church’s spiritual mission with cultural projects. The examiner will likely deploy the charge that an eschatologically charged two kingdoms view yields cultural quietism. The answer must clarify that a Reformed two kingdoms doctrine, properly set within inaugurated eschatology, does not remove Christ from any sphere but distinguishes modes of his rule. The church as church proclaims the gospel and administers sacraments; believers as citizens, scientists, or artists act under Christ’s providential rule guided by natural law and general revelation. The “already” of the kingdom motivates cultural obedience and neighbor love, while the “not yet” guards against utopian overreach and ecclesial mission drift.

Externally, the main rivals are liberal progressivism, secular autonomy, and radical anabaptism. Liberal Protestantism, influenced by Ritschl and later social gospel movements, reads the kingdom of God as the moralization of society, tied to democratic and humanitarian gains. Its eschatology is effectively realized and immanent, so that Christ and culture converge in a process of ethical evolution. From a Reformed‑Augustinian standpoint, this collapses the distinction between **common grace** and **saving grace**, and blurs the radical judgment that cross and parousia pronounce on human culture, including bourgeois liberal culture. Secular theories, whether Enlightenment or late modern, seek to free culture from any given theological order, construing it as autonomous human self‑expression or as the arena of procedural justice. Here Christ’s claim to universal lordship is reduced to private piety or communal identity, denied genuine public normativity. Eschatologically, secularism either denies any transcendent future or reprojects it in purely immanent technological or political utopias. In both cases, the Christian claim that Christ’s resurrection is the decisive turning of the ages becomes unintelligible.

Radical anabaptist streams, conversely, insist that any direct Christian participation in coercive institutions or state structures betrays the cruciform way of Jesus. The kingdom is wholly other, a contrast society visible in the church alone. While such traditions rightly emphasize Jesus’ teaching on discipleship and non‑conformity, a Reformed‑Augustinian eschatology will answer that the New Testament’s already–not yet also upholds civil authority as ordained by God in this age, precisely as a ministry of provisional justice. Withdrawal from culture as such fails to love the neighbor in the structures that inevitably shape his life. Moreover, it underestimates **creation** and **providence**, as if the only place God works is within the voluntary community of the church.

Contemporary debates sharpen these tensions. The collapse of Christendom in the West, the rise of pluralistic democracies, and the intensification of culture wars around sexuality, technology, and national identity force the question: how does Christ’s present reign, eschatologically understood, regulate Christian engagement now. On one extreme, forms of Christian nationalism seek once more to sacralize a culture or nation, treating it as the near expression of a Christian order and often collapsing ecclesiology into civil religion. On the other, progressive theologies fuse kingdom language with contemporary liberation programs, making eschatology a metaphor for intersectional justice. Both tendencies ignore the way the New Testament locates the kingdom primarily in the crucified and risen Christ and in the Spirit‑gathered church as first fruits of the new creation.

A properly eschatological account will insist that the church is a kind of “preview community” of the age to come, displaying in its worship, discipline, and shared life a foretaste of the coming kingdom. This has cultural implications: the church’s embodied practices relativize and critique the idolatries of every culture, including its own. Sunday worship relativizes the market and the nation. The fellowship of Jew and Gentile relativizes ethnic and class identities. Yet the church’s life also affirms created goods: language, music, hospitality, political prayer. From here Christians are sent into their vocations as those who live between the times, seeking justice, beauty, and truth as penultimate goods, knowing they will not usher in the eschaton yet confident that nothing done in the Lord is in vain.

This position integrates adjacent loci. In Christology, the exalted Christ as the second Adam and Lord of history grounds both cultural affirmation and critique. His humanity affirms creaturely and cultural particularity; his exaltation as judge brings every culture under eschatological scrutiny. In ecclesiology, the visible church as the embassy of the kingdom is distinct from but not indifferent to wider culture. In soteriology, **union with Christ** situates believers already in the heavenlies, yet calls them to suffer and serve within this age. In the doctrine of Scripture, the canonical narrative structures Christian cultural imagination: creation, fall, redemption, consummation. Eschatology thus is not an isolated “last things” appendix but the temporal grammar of every locus.

Examiners will often press a hard question: given this already–not yet, is any talk of “transforming culture” legitimate. The answer must be nuanced. On the one hand, because the Spirit’s renewing work in sanctification affects the whole person, believers’ cultural labors can manifest anticipatory signs of the new creation—acts of justice, artistic works, institutions ordered toward the good. On the other hand, these anticipations are fragmentary and ambiguous, always under the sign of the cross. One should therefore speak of “faithful cultural obedience under Christ’s lordship” rather than “redeeming” or “building the kingdom” through cultural projects. The kingdom is God’s eschatological gift, not our achievement. But precisely this frees Christians to work diligently for proximate goods without utopian illusions or despair.

The position I am defending, crystallized through Augustine, Calvin, Kuyper, Niebuhr as foil, and O’Donovan, can be summarized as follows. Christ, crucified and risen, is already Lord of all, and by his Spirit he has inaugurated the age to come. The church, as the community of the new covenant, is the primary locus where that reign is acknowledged, yet Christ’s rule extends providentially over all cultural spheres. Culture as such is a good of **creation**, preserved and directed by **common grace**, but under the conditions of sin it is pervasively disordered and idolatrous. The kingdom, therefore, both affirms and judges culture. Christians engage cultural life vigorously as those who have tasted the powers of the age to come, yet they do so as pilgrims whose citizenship is in heaven, awaiting the Savior who will transform all things at his appearing. Any theology of Christ and culture that blurs either side of this tension—either collapsing the kingdom into culture or severing them into unrelated realms—fails to do justice to the eschatological shape of the gospel.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The relation of Christ and culture in eschatological perspective is the account of how the exalted Christ’s already–not yet kingdom governs Christian affirmation, critique, and use of cultural life as a good of **creation** corrupted by sin and destined for renewal at the consummation.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: two cities, two loves, and **eschatological tension** that affirms temporal goods yet relativizes every culture.
  - Calvin: **two kingdoms** within one lordship of Christ, strong **common grace**, vocations as cultural service under an already–not yet kingdom.
  - Kuyper: **sphere sovereignty** and world‑and‑life view, expanded **common grace**, but needing eschatological correction to avoid triumphalism or sectarianism.
  - Niebuhr: influential typology of Christ and culture, but liberal historicist and weakly eschatological, serving mainly as a foil.
  - O’Donovan: resurrection‑centered political theology, provisional participation of earthly authority in Christ’s rule in the interim between resurrection and parousia.
- Debates:
  - Internal: nature–grace, **two kingdoms** versus **sphere sovereignty**, the church’s public role, dangers of quietism versus transformationalism.
  - External: liberal realized eschatology and progressivism, secular autonomy of culture, radical anabaptist withdrawal.
  - Contemporary: Christendom and post‑Christendom, Christian nationalism, liberationist kingdom‑language, culture wars over justice, sexuality, and technology.
- Defended position: A Reformed‑Augustinian, inaugurated eschatology in which Christ’s present universal lordship, exercised differently in church and civil order, calls Christians to hopeful, critical, non‑utopian cultural obedience under **common grace**, while locating the fullness of the kingdom exclusively in the consummation at Christ’s return.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - Does a two kingdoms view make Christ absent from culture. No, it distinguishes modes of his one reign, not zones of his absence, and is governed by already–not yet **eschatology**.
  - Can we speak of transforming culture. Only modestly, as Spirit‑wrought anticipations of the new creation, never as building or realizing the kingdom itself.
  - How do you avoid Christendom‑style idolatry of nation or culture. By maintaining Augustine’s two cities, O’Donovan’s sense of political provisionality, and the New Testament focus on the church as the primary embassy of the kingdom.
  - What is the church’s public role. To witness to Christ’s lordship through word, sacrament, discipline, and a distinctive communal life that critiques and serves the surrounding culture.
  - How does this shape ethics and vocation. Believers pursue justice, beauty, and truth in their callings as penultimate goods under **common grace**, knowing their labor is not the kingdom but is not in vain in the Lord.
