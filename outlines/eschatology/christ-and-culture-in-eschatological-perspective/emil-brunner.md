# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the relationship between **Christ and culture** through the lens of **eschatology**, emphasizing the tension between the **kingdom of God** and the realities of human society. He argued that while the **Christian faith** must engage culture, it does so from a position of **dialectical tension**, recognizing both the provisional value and the fallen nature of cultural achievements in light of the coming **eschatological fulfillment**.

- "The Christian is in the world, but not of the world; he lives in the tension between the 'already' and the 'not yet' of the Kingdom of God." ("The Divine Imperative")

## Key Works

- "The Divine Imperative" (1932)
- "The Mediator" (1934)
- "Man in Revolt" (1937)
- "Eternal Hope" (1954)
- "Truth as Encounter" (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Dualism**
   - Stresses the distinction between the **present age** and the **age to come**.
   - Sees all cultural achievements as provisional in light of the final **consummation**.
   - Argues that Christians live in the tension of the **already/not yet**.
   - Maintains that ultimate hope is found only in the **eschatological kingdom**.
   - "The world is not the Kingdom of God, but it is the sphere in which the Kingdom is to be realized." ("Eternal Hope")

2. **Christ as the Norm for Culture**
   - Christ provides the ultimate criterion for judging all cultural forms.
   - Cultural values are relativized by the **revelation of God in Christ**.
   - The **incarnation** affirms the value of creation but also exposes its fallenness.
   - Christian engagement with culture must be critical and discerning.
   - "Christ is the measure by which all things are judged, including culture." ("The Divine Imperative")

3. **Dialectical Engagement with Culture**
   - Advocates for a dynamic, dialogical relationship between faith and culture.
   - Rejects both cultural withdrawal and uncritical assimilation.
   - Emphasizes the need for **responsible action** within society.
   - Recognizes the ambiguity and brokenness of all human institutions.
   - "The Christian is called to live responsibly in the world, but always under the judgment of God." ("The Divine Imperative")

4. **Provisional Value of Culture**
   - Culture has real, though limited, significance in God's providence.
   - Human creativity reflects the **imago Dei**, yet is marred by sin.
   - Cultural achievements can serve the neighbor and promote justice.
   - All cultural work is subject to eschatological transformation.
   - "Culture is not the Kingdom, but it is the field in which the Kingdom works." ("The Divine Imperative")

5. **Hope in Eschatological Fulfillment**
   - The Christian's ultimate hope is in the **future consummation** of God's reign.
   - Present cultural efforts are meaningful but incomplete.
   - Eschatological hope relativizes both cultural successes and failures.
   - The church witnesses to the coming kingdom through its life and mission.
   - "Our hope is not in what we can achieve, but in what God will bring to pass." ("Eternal Hope")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s eschatological approach to **Christ and culture** has shaped modern discussions on the church’s role in society, particularly within the **dialectical theology** tradition. His insistence on the provisional and ambiguous nature of culture, alongside the enduring hope of the **kingdom of God**, continues to influence both Reformed and ecumenical perspectives. Brunner’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a nuanced, theologically robust engagement with culture in light of eschatological realities.
