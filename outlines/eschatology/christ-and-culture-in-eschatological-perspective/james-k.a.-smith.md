# James K. A. Smith (1970– )

James K. A. Smith approaches the question of **Christ and culture** through a robustly **eschatological lens**, emphasizing the formative power of **cultural liturgies** and the inaugurated-yet-not-consummated nature of the **Kingdom of God**. He contends that Christian engagement with culture must be shaped by an **Augustinian vision** of desire, oriented toward the coming **New Creation**, and attentive to the ways in which cultural practices shape our loves and hopes.

- "The shape of Christian hope is not escape from the world but rather the hope of its renewal and restoration." ("Desiring the Kingdom")

## Key Works

- Desiring the Kingdom: Worship, Worldview, and Cultural Formation (2009)
- Awaiting the King: Reforming Public Theology (2017)
- Imagining the Kingdom: How Worship Works (2013)
- How (Not) to Be Secular: Reading Charles Taylor (2014)
- You Are What You Love: The Spiritual Power of Habit (2016)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Orientation of Cultural Engagement**
    - Christian interaction with culture is shaped by the tension of the "already" and "not yet" of the **Kingdom of God**.
    - The church anticipates the **New Creation** and participates in its foretaste through worship and mission.
    - Cultural transformation is provisional, never ultimate, and always oriented toward eschatological fulfillment.
    - The hope of **resurrection** and renewal grounds Christian patience and critique of cultural idols.
    - "We are called to live as citizens of the coming kingdom, even as we inhabit the penultimate city." (Awaiting the King)

2. **Primacy of Liturgical Formation**
    - Human beings are fundamentally **desiring creatures** shaped by practices, not just ideas.
    - **Cultural liturgies**—secular or sacred—form our loves and direct our vision of the good life.
    - Christian worship re-forms desire toward the **eschatological telos** of union with Christ.
    - The church's liturgy is a counter-formation to the rival liturgies of secular culture.
    - "Liturgies shape what we love, and what we love shapes what we hope for." (Desiring the Kingdom)

3. **Augustinian Anthropology**
    - Smith draws on **Augustine** to argue that the heart, not merely the intellect, is the seat of transformation.
    - Our loves and longings are oriented by the ultimate object of our worship.
    - Sin is fundamentally a disordering of desire, which is healed by reordering toward God.
    - Cultural practices can either deform or reform our loves in light of the **eschaton**.
    - "To be human is to be a lover, and our loves are shaped and aimed by liturgical practices." (You Are What You Love)

4. **Critique of Secular Neutrality**
    - Smith challenges the myth of a **neutral public square**, arguing all cultural spaces are shaped by ultimate commitments.
    - Secularism is itself a kind of liturgical formation, shaping desires and eschatological hopes.
    - Christians must recognize and resist the formative power of secular liturgies.
    - Public theology should be unapologetically shaped by the **eschatological vision** of the gospel.
    - "There is no neutral ground; every public space is thick with liturgical significance." (Awaiting the King)

5. **Political Theology and the Church’s Public Witness**
    - The church is a **polis** that embodies an alternative vision of the good in anticipation of the **Kingdom**.
    - Christian political engagement is marked by humility, patience, and hope, not triumphalism.
    - The church’s public witness is primarily enacted through its worship and communal practices.
    - Eschatological hope relativizes all earthly politics and cultural projects.
    - "The church is not a means to the kingdom; it is the sign and foretaste of the kingdom." (Awaiting the King)

## Legacy and Impact

Smith has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **Christ and culture** by reframing them through the categories of **desire**, **liturgy**, and **eschatology**. His work has challenged both Reformed and broader evangelical circles to reconsider the formative power of cultural practices and the centrality of worship in public theology. By emphasizing the church as a community oriented toward the coming **Kingdom of God**, Smith has provided a robust alternative to both cultural withdrawal and uncritical accommodation. His influence endures in debates about Christian education, political theology, and the church’s mission in a secular age.
