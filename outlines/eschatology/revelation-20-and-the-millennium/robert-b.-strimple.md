# Robert B. Strimple (1932– )

Robert B. Strimple is a prominent advocate of **amillennialism**, interpreting **Revelation 20** as a symbolic depiction of the present reign of Christ rather than a literal future **millennium**. He emphasizes the unity of **redemptive history** and the fulfillment of **eschatological promises** in Christ, rejecting a future earthly reign distinct from the current church age.

- "The millennium described in Revelation 20 is not a future earthly golden age, but the present reign of Christ with his saints in heaven." ("Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond")

## Key Works

- "Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond" (contributor)
- "The Modern Search for the Real Jesus" (relevant for eschatological method)
- "The Bible and the Future" (chapters on eschatology)
- "Revelation 20 and the Millennium: A Case for Amillennialism" (article in various collections)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Reading of Revelation 20**
    - Interprets the "thousand years" as a symbolic period representing the present church age.
    - Rejects a literal, earthly reign of Christ prior to the final judgment.
    - Sees the binding of Satan as Christ’s victory at his first coming.
    - Argues that the "first resurrection" refers to the souls of believers reigning with Christ in heaven.
    - "The thousand years is a symbolic number, not a literal chronological period." ("Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond")

2. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Stresses the continuity between Old and New Testaments in the unfolding of God’s plan.
    - Views the church as the true Israel, inheriting the promises of God.
    - Rejects dispensational distinctions between Israel and the church.
    - Sees all eschatological hope fulfilled in Christ’s person and work.
    - "There is one people of God, and one redemptive plan culminating in Christ." ("Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond")

3. **Symbolic Hermeneutic for Apocalyptic Literature**
    - Advocates a non-literal, symbolic interpretation of apocalyptic texts like Revelation.
    - Emphasizes genre sensitivity and the use of Old Testament imagery.
    - Warns against speculative chronological schemes based on apocalyptic passages.
    - Argues that Revelation’s visions are theological, not predictive blueprints.
    - "We must interpret apocalyptic literature in light of its symbolic character." ("Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond")

4. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - Affirms that the kingdom of God is both present and future.
    - The reign of Christ is inaugurated but awaits consummation at his return.
    - Believers participate now in spiritual blessings, anticipating bodily resurrection.
    - The final judgment and new creation will occur at Christ’s second coming, not separated by a millennium.
    - "The New Testament teaches an inaugurated eschatology: the kingdom is already here, but not yet fully realized." ("Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond")

5. **Rejection of Premillennialism and Postmillennialism**
    - Critiques premillennialism for dividing the return of Christ into multiple stages.
    - Rejects postmillennial optimism about a golden age prior to Christ’s return.
    - Argues both views misunderstand the nature of the millennium in Revelation 20.
    - Maintains that the resurrection, judgment, and new creation are simultaneous events.
    - "Neither premillennialism nor postmillennialism does justice to the structure of biblical eschatology." ("Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond")

## Legacy and Impact

Strimple’s robust defense of **amillennialism** has shaped contemporary Reformed eschatology, especially within confessional circles. His clear articulation of the symbolic interpretation of **Revelation 20** has provided a framework for pastors and scholars to engage with millennial debates. Through his teaching and writing, Strimple has contributed to the ongoing relevance of classic Reformed approaches to **eschatology** in the modern church.
