# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine offered a decisive interpretation of **Revelation 20** that shaped the Western church’s understanding of the **millennium**. Rejecting a literal thousand-year earthly reign, he advanced an **amillennial** reading, identifying the millennium with the present age of the **church** and the spiritual reign of **Christ** with his saints. This approach reframed eschatological expectation around the ongoing reality of **Christ’s kingdom** rather than a future earthly utopia.

- "The thousand years, therefore, may be understood in two ways, so far as occurs to me: either because these things happen in the sixth millennium, or because they are perfected in the whole time which is signified by that number." (City of God, XX.7)

## Key Works

- City of God (especially Book XX)
- Tractates on the Gospel of John
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- Letters (Epistulae) addressing eschatological questions

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - The "thousand years" is a symbolic period, not a literal future reign.
    - The millennium represents the current era between **Christ’s first and second comings**.
    - The binding of **Satan** refers to the limitation of his power during the church age.
    - The "first resurrection" is spiritual, signifying regeneration and new life in Christ.
    - "Therefore the Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven." (City of God, XX.9)

2. **Rejection of Earthly Utopianism**
    - Augustine opposes **chiliasm** (premillennialism) and its expectation of a future, earthly golden age.
    - He warns against carnal interpretations that anticipate material rewards.
    - The true hope of believers is found in the **heavenly city**, not an earthly millennium.
    - The church’s present sufferings are part of the pilgrimage toward the eternal kingdom.
    - "They who on the strength of this passage have suspected that the first resurrection is future and bodily, are moved chiefly by the sound of the thousand years." (City of God, XX.7)

3. **Spiritual Reign of Christ and the Saints**
    - Christ reigns now from heaven, and his saints share in this reign through faith.
    - The "reigning" of the saints is realized in their victory over sin and participation in the life of the church.
    - The church is the locus of Christ’s kingdom on earth during the millennium.
    - The final consummation awaits the **resurrection of the body** and the new creation.
    - "The Church, therefore, even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven." (City of God, XX.9)

4. **Two Resurrections: Spiritual and Bodily**
    - The "first resurrection" in Revelation 20 is spiritual, referring to regeneration.
    - The "second resurrection" is bodily, occurring at the final judgment.
    - This distinction upholds the already/not yet tension in **Christian eschatology**.
    - The final resurrection brings the fullness of **eternal life** and judgment.
    - "The first resurrection, then, is the resurrection of the soul, the second of the body." (City of God, XX.9)

5. **Satan’s Binding and Eschatological Restraint**
    - Satan’s binding is a present reality, limiting his ability to deceive the nations.
    - This restraint enables the **gospel** to spread throughout the world.
    - The loosing of Satan at the end of the millennium signals the final crisis before Christ’s return.
    - The ultimate defeat of Satan occurs at the final judgment.
    - "He is bound during the whole period of the Church’s reign, that he may not seduce the nations." (City of God, XX.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s **amillennial** interpretation of Revelation 20 became the dominant view in Western Christianity, shaping both medieval and Reformation-era eschatology. His rejection of a literal earthly millennium provided a theological framework that emphasized the present reality of Christ’s reign and the spiritual nature of the church’s hope. Augustine’s approach continues to influence contemporary discussions on the **millennium** and the interpretation of apocalyptic texts.
