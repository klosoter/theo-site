# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a **Reformed eschatology** that interprets **Revelation 20** and the **millennium** within an **amillennial** framework. They emphasize the present reign of Christ, the ongoing spiritual conflict of the church, and the expectation of a single, climactic **Second Coming** and final judgment, rather than a literal thousand-year earthly reign.

- "Christ is seated at the right hand of God... until He returns to judge the living and the dead." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 50)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Articles 37 ("The Last Judgment")
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Days 19 and 22 (Q&A 50–52, 57–58)
- Canons of Dort, Fifth Head, Article 12
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - The millennium is understood as the present reign of Christ with His saints, not a future earthly kingdom.
    - The binding of Satan refers to the restraint of his power during the church age.
    - The first resurrection is interpreted spiritually, as regeneration or the souls of believers reigning with Christ.
    - The final judgment and resurrection occur at Christ’s return, not separated by a millennium.
    - "Our Lord Jesus Christ will come from heaven... to declare all men, both the good and the wicked, to be rewarded according to their works." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

2. **Unity of the Church Age and Eschaton**
    - The church age is the last era before the consummation; no intermediate millennial age is expected.
    - Believers already participate in Christ’s reign through union with Him.
    - The distinction between the present age and the age to come is absolute.
    - The hope of the church is fixed on Christ’s return, not a prior golden age.
    - "We expect that great day with a most ardent desire, to the end that we may fully enjoy the promises of God in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

3. **Single, Universal Resurrection and Judgment**
    - Both the righteous and the wicked will be raised and judged at the same time.
    - There is no scriptural warrant for a two-stage resurrection or judgment.
    - The final state is inaugurated immediately after Christ’s return.
    - The millennium does not divide the resurrection or judgment into separate events.
    - "All men will appear personally before the great Judge... to give an account of all they have done." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 52)

4. **Christ’s Present Kingship**
    - Christ is now reigning at the right hand of the Father, exercising authority over all things.
    - His kingdom is spiritual, advancing through the gospel and the church.
    - The defeat of Satan and the powers of evil is assured, though not yet fully consummated.
    - The millennium is not a future earthly reign but the current reality of Christ’s rule.
    - "He governs us by His Word and Spirit, and defends and preserves us in the redemption obtained for us." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 51)

5. **Pastoral Assurance and Eschatological Hope**
    - The focus is on the comfort and assurance believers have in Christ’s finished work.
    - The certainty of resurrection and eternal life is grounded in Christ’s victory.
    - The millennium is not a speculative hope but a present reality for the church.
    - The final consummation is eagerly awaited as the fulfillment of God’s promises.
    - "After this life I shall inherit perfect salvation... which eye has not seen, nor ear heard." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 58)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped **Reformed eschatology**, establishing the amillennial interpretation of **Revelation 20** as confessional orthodoxy in continental Reformed churches. Their clear articulation of the unity of the church age and the final consummation has provided enduring pastoral comfort and doctrinal clarity. These confessions continue to influence Reformed theology, catechesis, and ecumenical dialogue on the millennium and last things.
