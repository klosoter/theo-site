# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached **Revelation 20** and the question of the **millennium** within the framework of **Augustinian amillennialism**, interpreting the passage symbolically rather than as a prophecy of a literal thousand-year earthly reign. He understood the **binding of Satan** and the **reign of the saints** as realities inaugurated by Christ’s first coming and continuing through the present age, culminating in the final judgment and the **consummation of all things**.

- "The thousand years signify the whole period of the Church’s reign, in which the saints reign with Christ spiritually, yet not carnally." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q77, A1, ad 5)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially Supplement, Q77)
- Catena Aurea (Commentary on the Gospels, with references to Revelation)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard (Book IV)
- Compendium Theologiae

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Rejects a literal thousand-year earthly reign of Christ and the saints.
    - Follows **Augustine** in viewing the millennium as the present age of the Church.
    - Sees the "first resurrection" as spiritual, referring to regeneration or the reign of souls in heaven.
    - Interprets the "binding of Satan" as Christ’s victory over evil through His passion and resurrection.
    - "The thousand years denote the time from Christ’s first coming to the end of the world." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q77, A1, ad 5)

2. **Christ’s Reign is Spiritual, Not Temporal**
    - Christ’s kingship is primarily exercised through the Church and the souls of the faithful.
    - The saints reign with Christ by sharing in His grace and glory, not by ruling earthly kingdoms.
    - The Church’s victory is spiritual, marked by the spread of the Gospel and sanctification.
    - Earthly expectations of a carnal kingdom are rejected as misunderstandings of biblical prophecy.
    - "The reign of the saints with Christ is to be understood of spiritual joy, not of temporal dominion." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q77, A1, ad 5)

3. **Final Judgment Follows the Millennium**
    - The millennium concludes with the **final judgment** and the resurrection of the body.
    - The defeat of Satan at the end of the age marks the transition to the eternal state.
    - The resurrection and judgment are single, universal events, not divided into stages.
    - The consummation of all things brings about the new creation and eternal blessedness for the saints.
    - "After the time of the Church’s warfare, the final resurrection and judgment will come." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q77, A1)

4. **Typological and Allegorical Reading of Apocalyptic Texts**
    - Apocalyptic numbers and images are interpreted symbolically, not literally.
    - The "thousand years" represents completeness or fullness of time, not a precise duration.
    - The imagery of Revelation is meant to encourage perseverance and hope, not to provide a timeline.
    - Allegorical interpretation is guided by the rule of faith and the consensus of the Fathers.
    - "Scripture often uses numbers symbolically to signify perfection or totality." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q77, A1, ad 5)

5. **Continuity with Patristic Tradition**
    - Aquinas aligns with **Augustine** and the mainstream Western tradition against chiliastic views.
    - He draws on the authority of the Fathers to interpret Revelation 20 within orthodox eschatology.
    - Emphasizes the unity of the Church’s teaching on the last things.
    - Rejects millenarianism as a deviation from received doctrine.
    - "The Church does not teach a carnal reign of Christ on earth, but a spiritual reign in the hearts of the faithful." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q77, A1, ad 5)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s **amillennial** reading of Revelation 20 shaped the dominant eschatological outlook of medieval and later Western theology, reinforcing the symbolic interpretation of the millennium. His synthesis of **patristic tradition** and systematic theology provided a foundation for subsequent Catholic and many Reformed approaches to apocalyptic texts. Aquinas’s influence ensured that millenarianism remained a marginal position in mainstream Christian doctrine, and his careful exegesis continues to inform theological reflection on the **last things**.
