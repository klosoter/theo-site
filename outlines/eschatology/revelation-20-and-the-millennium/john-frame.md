# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches **Revelation 20 and the millennium** from a distinctly **Reformed** and **amillennial** perspective, emphasizing a **redemptive-historical hermeneutic** and the centrality of **Christ’s present reign**. He interprets the millennium as a symbolic representation of the church age, highlighting the unity of **eschatological hope** and the fulfillment of prophecy in Christ.

- "The millennium is best understood as the present reign of Christ with his saints, inaugurated at his resurrection and continuing until his return." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2013)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Interprets the "thousand years" as a symbolic period, not a literal future era.
    - Understands the binding of Satan as accomplished by Christ’s victory at the cross and resurrection.
    - Views the "first resurrection" as the believer’s spiritual regeneration or entrance into heaven.
    - Emphasizes continuity between the present age and the age to come.
    "The millennium is not a future golden age, but the present reign of Christ with his people." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
    - Reads Revelation 20 in the context of the entire biblical storyline.
    - Prioritizes Christ’s finished work as the interpretive center.
    - Rejects isolated or atomistic readings of apocalyptic texts.
    - Sees Old Testament prophecy as fulfilled in Christ and the church.
    "We must interpret the millennium in light of the whole redemptive history, not as a separate epoch." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Christ’s Present Reign**
    - Affirms that Christ currently reigns from heaven over his church and the nations.
    - Identifies the "millennium" with the church age, inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection.
    - Believers participate in this reign through union with Christ.
    - The final consummation awaits Christ’s visible return.
    "Christ’s reign is a present reality, not merely a future hope." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Symbolic Nature of Apocalyptic Literature**
    - Recognizes the highly figurative language of Revelation.
    - Warns against overly literal interpretations of numbers and images.
    - Sees the "thousand years" as representing completeness or fullness.
    - Interprets Revelation 20 in harmony with the book’s overall symbolism.
    "Revelation’s numbers and images are symbols, not precise predictions." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Unity of Eschatological Hope**
    - Emphasizes the single, climactic return of Christ.
    - Rejects schemes that divide Christ’s coming into multiple stages.
    - Sees resurrection, judgment, and new creation as concurrent events.
    - Stresses the hope of the new heavens and new earth as the believer’s ultimate destiny.
    "The New Testament presents one return of Christ, one resurrection, and one final judgment." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **amillennialism** and his commitment to a **redemptive-historical hermeneutic** have significantly shaped Reformed and evangelical approaches to eschatology. His emphasis on the unity of **eschatological hope** and the present reality of **Christ’s kingdom** continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking a biblically grounded understanding of Revelation 20 and the millennium.
