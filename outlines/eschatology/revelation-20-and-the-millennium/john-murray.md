# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached **Revelation 20** and the **millennium** from a Reformed, amillennial perspective, emphasizing the symbolic nature of apocalyptic literature and the unity of **redemptive history**. He argued that the **millennial reign** described in Revelation 20 refers to the present reign of Christ with his saints, rather than a future earthly kingdom, and that the passage must be interpreted in light of the whole **biblical eschatology**.

- "The passage in Revelation 20 does not warrant the expectation of a future earthly reign of Christ prior to the final consummation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Book of Revelation" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "The Advent of Christ" (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT, relevant for eschatological themes)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (for Murray’s broader eschatological framework)
- "Systematic Theology" lectures (unpublished, but influential in his teaching on eschatology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Interprets the **millennium** as the present reign of Christ with departed saints.
    - Rejects a literal thousand-year earthly reign.
    - Views the binding of Satan as Christ’s victory at his first coming.
    - Sees the "first resurrection" as spiritual, not bodily.
    - "The thousand years is a symbolical number denoting the period of Christ’s reign from his ascension to his return." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Stresses the continuity between Old and New Testament eschatology.
    - Opposes dispensational separations of Israel and the church.
    - Sees all of history moving toward the final consummation in Christ.
    - Interprets Revelation 20 within the broader biblical narrative.
    - "There is one people of God, and one consummation to which all history moves." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Symbolic Nature of Apocalyptic Literature**
    - Emphasizes the figurative and symbolic language of Revelation.
    - Warns against woodenly literal interpretations of apocalyptic numbers and images.
    - Argues that the millennium is a theological symbol, not a chronological period.
    - Reads Revelation 20 in light of the book’s overall genre and purpose.
    - "The apocalyptic form demands that we interpret its numbers and images symbolically." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Single Return of Christ**
    - Affirms one, climactic **parousia** of Christ at the end of the age.
    - Rejects the idea of multiple stages in Christ’s coming.
    - Sees the resurrection, judgment, and new creation as simultaneous events.
    - Interprets Revelation 20 as consistent with the rest of New Testament eschatology.
    - "The New Testament knows of only one coming of Christ in glory, not two." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Pastoral Implications of Eschatology**
    - Stresses the present hope and reign of believers with Christ.
    - Encourages perseverance in the face of suffering, knowing Christ reigns now.
    - Warns against speculative end-times schemes that distract from gospel living.
    - Grounds assurance in the finished work and present reign of Christ.
    - "Our hope is not in a future earthly kingdom, but in the present and future reign of Christ." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s **amillennial** reading of Revelation 20 has shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. His careful exegesis and insistence on the unity of **redemptive history** provided a robust alternative to both dispensational and historic premillennial views. Murray’s influence endures in Reformed seminaries and churches, where his approach to eschatology continues to inform biblical interpretation and pastoral ministry.
