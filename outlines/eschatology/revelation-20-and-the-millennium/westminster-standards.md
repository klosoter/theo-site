# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a classic **amillennial** position on **Revelation 20**, emphasizing the **spiritual reign of Christ**, the **unity of the covenant of grace**, and the single, climactic nature of the **resurrection** and **final judgment**. They reject a literal thousand-year earthly reign, instead teaching that Christ’s kingdom is presently manifested in the church and will be consummated at his return.

- "The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption; but their souls...immediately return to God who gave them...and the bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonour: the bodies of the just, by his Spirit, unto honour, and be made conformable to his own glorious body." (Westminster Confession of Faith 32.1–2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapters 32–33
- Larger Catechism, Questions 84–90
- Shorter Catechism, Questions 37–38
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on the Lord’s Day and eschatology)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on Christ’s kingdom and judgment)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Rejects a literal, future thousand-year reign of Christ on earth.
    - Interprets the "millennium" as the present reign of Christ with his saints in heaven.
    - Sees the binding of Satan as inaugurated by Christ’s first coming.
    - Understands the "first resurrection" as spiritual (regeneration or the intermediate state).
    "The kingdom of Christ is now present in the church, and will be consummated at his return." (WCF 25.2)

2. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Affirms one overarching covenant throughout redemptive history.
    - Sees the church as the Israel of God, inheriting Old Testament promises.
    - Rejects any future, separate dispensation for ethnic Israel.
    - Connects eschatological hope to the fulfillment of the covenant in Christ.
    "There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations." (WCF 7.6)

3. **Single, Final Resurrection and Judgment**
    - Teaches a general resurrection of both the just and unjust at Christ’s return.
    - Denies any intervening period between resurrection and final judgment.
    - Locates the defeat of evil and the renewal of creation at the end of the age.
    - Rejects a two-stage return of Christ or separate judgments.
    "God hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world, in righteousness, by Jesus Christ." (WCF 33.1)

4. **Spiritual Nature of Christ’s Kingdom**
    - Emphasizes the present, spiritual reign of Christ from heaven.
    - Identifies the church as the visible manifestation of Christ’s kingdom on earth.
    - Denies that Christ’s kingdom is of this world or established by earthly means.
    - Sees the millennium as the age between Christ’s first and second comings.
    "The visible church...is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, the house and family of God." (WCF 25.2)

5. **Certainty and Imminence of Christ’s Return**
    - Affirms the certainty of Christ’s bodily, visible return.
    - Warns against speculation about times and seasons.
    - Encourages watchfulness and readiness among believers.
    - Links the hope of resurrection and judgment to Christ’s imminent coming.
    "As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a day of judgment...so will he have that day unknown to men." (WCF 33.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped **Reformed eschatology**, establishing the amillennial framework as normative in Presbyterian and many Reformed traditions. Their interpretation of **Revelation 20** continues to influence confessional statements, preaching, and theological education. By emphasizing the unity of the covenant and the spiritual nature of Christ’s kingdom, the Standards provide a robust alternative to premillennial and dispensational readings, anchoring hope in the consummation of all things at Christ’s return.
