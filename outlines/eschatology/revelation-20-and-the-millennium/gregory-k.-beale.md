# Greg K. Beale (1952– )

Greg K. Beale is a leading advocate of **amillennialism** and a prominent voice in interpreting **Revelation 20** within the framework of **inaugurated eschatology**. He contends that the **millennium** refers symbolically to the present reign of Christ with his saints, inaugurated at his resurrection and continuing until his return, rather than a literal thousand-year earthly kingdom. Beale’s exegesis emphasizes the **recapitulation** structure of Revelation and the centrality of Christ’s victory over Satan.

- "The thousand years in Revelation 20:1–6 is a figurative expression for the long period of the church age, beginning with Christ’s resurrection and ending with his second coming." ("The Book of Revelation," NIGTC, p. 972)

## Key Works

- "The Book of Revelation" (New International Greek Testament Commentary, 1999)
- "A New Testament Biblical Theology" (2011)
- "The Temple and the Church’s Mission" (2004)
- "The Use of Daniel in Jewish Apocalyptic Literature and in the Revelation of St. John" (1984)
- "Revelation: A Shorter Commentary" (2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - The millennium is a symbolic period representing the current church age.
    - Christ’s reign is spiritual, not earthly, and began at his resurrection.
    - The binding of Satan refers to his restriction from deceiving the nations regarding the gospel.
    - The "first resurrection" is the believer’s spiritual resurrection with Christ.
    - "The millennium is not a future earthly golden age but the present reign of Christ with his saints." ("The Book of Revelation," p. 1000)

2. **Recapitulation Structure of Revelation**
    - Revelation 20:1–10 recapitulates, rather than follows chronologically, the events of chapters 19 and earlier.
    - The visions in Revelation are parallel, each depicting the same period from different angles.
    - The final judgment and the defeat of Satan are described multiple times in Revelation.
    - This structure supports a non-literal, theological reading of the millennium.
    - "The visions of Revelation are not strictly sequential but often overlap, depicting the same realities in different ways." ("The Book of Revelation," p. 972)

3. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
    - The "already/not yet" framework is central to understanding the millennium.
    - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the eschatological age, including the binding of Satan.
    - Believers participate now in the first resurrection through union with Christ.
    - The consummation awaits Christ’s return, when the final resurrection and judgment occur.
    - "The millennium is part of the inaugurated eschatological reign of Christ, not a separate future era." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology," p. 1019)

4. **Symbolic Hermeneutic of Apocalyptic Literature**
    - Numbers and images in Revelation are symbolic, not literal.
    - The "thousand years" signifies a complete, divinely appointed period.
    - Apocalyptic language conveys theological truths about Christ’s victory and the church’s perseverance.
    - The genre of Revelation demands sensitivity to Old Testament background and symbolism.
    - "The thousand years is a symbolic number, not a literal chronological period." ("The Book of Revelation," p. 972)

5. **Christocentric Focus of Eschatology**
    - Christ’s person and work are central to the meaning of the millennium.
    - The victory over Satan is accomplished through Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - The church’s reign with Christ is grounded in union with him.
    - The ultimate hope is the new creation, not a temporary earthly kingdom.
    - "The focus of Revelation 20 is the triumph of Christ and the security of his people, not a future earthly reign." ("The Book of Revelation," p. 1001)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **amillennial** scholarship, especially among Reformed and evangelical interpreters. His rigorous exegesis and emphasis on **inaugurated eschatology** have provided a robust alternative to dispensational and premillennial readings of Revelation 20. By highlighting the symbolic and theological dimensions of apocalyptic literature, Beale has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to eschatology. His contributions continue to inform debates on the nature of the millennium and the interpretation of biblical prophecy.
