# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **Revelation 20** and the **millennium** not as literal future events, but as **symbolic expressions** of the existential struggle between **good and evil** within history. He interpreted apocalyptic imagery through the lens of his **method of correlation**, emphasizing the ongoing dialectic of **kairos** and the **New Being** rather than a specific eschatological timetable.

- "The symbols of the end are not predictions of future events, but expressions of the ultimate meaning of history." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 3")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Symbolic Interpretation of Apocalyptic Texts**
    - Revelation 20 is understood as a symbolic narrative, not a literal prophecy.
    - Apocalyptic language expresses the ultimate concerns of existence.
    - The millennium represents the hope for the **Kingdom of God** breaking into history.
    - Tillich rejects literalist readings in favor of existential meaning.
    - "Apocalyptic symbols point to the depth of historical existence, not to its chronological end." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Primacy of Existential Meaning**
    - The millennium is a symbol of the victory of the **New Being** over estrangement.
    - Eschatological hope is rooted in the transformation of the present, not a future age.
    - The struggle between good and evil is an ongoing existential reality.
    - The ultimate fulfillment is found in the **eternal**, not in temporal history.
    - "The ultimate is present wherever the New Being is manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Method of Correlation**
    - Theological symbols respond to existential questions posed by human existence.
    - Revelation 20 addresses the human longing for justice and ultimate meaning.
    - The millennium is correlated with the hope for **redemption** and **reconciliation**.
    - Tillich’s method bridges biblical symbols and contemporary existential concerns.
    - "The method of correlation interprets symbols in relation to the questions of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Rejection of Chronological Eschatology**
    - Tillich denies a literal, future thousand-year reign.
    - The focus is on the **kairos**, the decisive moment of transformation.
    - History is open to the breaking-in of the **eternal** at any moment.
    - The end is not a temporal event but a qualitative transformation.
    - "Eschatology is the anticipation of the ultimate meaning, not the calculation of future events." (The Interpretation of History)

5. **The Kingdom of God as Present Reality**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is a present, dynamic reality, not merely future.
    - The millennium symbolizes the ongoing realization of divine justice and love.
    - The church participates in the manifestation of the Kingdom here and now.
    - The final victory is anticipated in every act of **reconciliation** and **justice**.
    - "The Kingdom of God is wherever the power of the New Being is actualized." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s interpretation of **Revelation 20** and the **millennium** has profoundly shaped modern theological approaches to apocalyptic literature, emphasizing existential and symbolic readings over literalist or historicist schemes. His influence is evident in the way contemporary theology addresses **eschatology** as a matter of present transformation rather than future prediction. By integrating the **method of correlation** and existential analysis, Tillich has provided a framework for understanding biblical symbols as addressing the deepest human concerns, leaving a lasting mark on both academic and pastoral theology.
