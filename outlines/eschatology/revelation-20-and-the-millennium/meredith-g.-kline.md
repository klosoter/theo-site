# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline advanced a distinctive interpretation of **Revelation 20** and the **millennium** within a Reformed, amillennial framework. He emphasized the symbolic nature of apocalyptic literature, viewing the **millennial reign** as the present age between Christ’s first and second comings, marked by the inaugurated reality of the **kingdom of God** and the binding of **Satan**. Kline’s approach integrates **covenant theology** and a robust understanding of **eschatological fulfillment**.

- "The millennium is the interadventual age, the period between the two comings of Christ, during which the saints reign with him in heaven." ("The Structure of Biblical Authority")

## Key Works

- "The Structure of Biblical Authority"
- "Kingdom Prologue"
- "By Oath Consigned"
- "Images of the Spirit"
- "God, Heaven and Har Magedon"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Asserts that the millennium is not a literal thousand-year period but symbolizes the current church age.
    - Interprets the binding of Satan as Christ’s victory in his first coming, limiting Satan’s ability to deceive the nations.
    - Views the “first resurrection” as the believer’s entrance into the intermediate state, not a physical resurrection.
    - Emphasizes the continuity between the present age and the age to come, rejecting a future earthly millennium.
    - "The thousand years of Revelation 20 is the present age of the church, not a future golden era." ("God, Heaven and Har Magedon")

2. **Symbolic and Covenantal Reading of Apocalyptic Literature**
    - Stresses the symbolic nature of apocalyptic numbers and imagery in Revelation.
    - Relates the millennium to covenantal themes of kingdom and judgment.
    - Argues that the imagery of Revelation 20 must be interpreted in light of the whole biblical canon.
    - Maintains that apocalyptic visions communicate theological realities, not chronological sequences.
    - "Revelation’s symbols are covenantal, not merely predictive of historical events." ("Images of the Spirit")

3. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
    - Holds that the **kingdom of God** is already inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - The reign of the saints with Christ is a present, heavenly reality.
    - The defeat of Satan is real but awaits final consummation at Christ’s return.
    - The church lives in the tension of the “already” and “not yet” of redemptive history.
    - "The millennium is the age of the church’s witness under Christ’s heavenly reign." ("Kingdom Prologue")

4. **Covenant Structure of Redemptive History**
    - Interprets Revelation 20 within the broader framework of **covenant theology**.
    - Sees the millennium as the outworking of the new covenant, secured by Christ’s victory.
    - Connects the saints’ reign to their covenantal union with Christ.
    - Emphasizes the legal and judicial aspects of Satan’s binding and judgment.
    - "The millennium is the judicial outworking of Christ’s covenantal triumph." ("By Oath Consigned")

5. **Heavenly Reign and Intermediate State**
    - Identifies the “reigning” saints as those who have died and are with Christ in heaven.
    - The “first resurrection” refers to the believer’s entrance into the intermediate state, not bodily resurrection.
    - The church on earth participates in this reign through union with Christ.
    - The final resurrection and judgment will occur at Christ’s second coming, ending the millennium.
    - "The first resurrection is the entrance of the saints into heavenly life with Christ, not a physical event on earth." ("God, Heaven and Har Magedon")

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s interpretation of **Revelation 20** has significantly shaped Reformed amillennial thought, especially among those emphasizing **covenant theology** and inaugurated eschatology. His symbolic and canonical approach to apocalyptic literature has influenced both academic and pastoral readings of the millennium. Kline’s work continues to be a touchstone for those seeking a robust, redemptive-historical understanding of eschatology within the Reformed tradition.
