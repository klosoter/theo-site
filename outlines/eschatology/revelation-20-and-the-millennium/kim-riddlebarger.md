# Kim Riddlebarger (1955–)

Kim Riddlebarger is a leading advocate of **amillennialism**, interpreting **Revelation 20** as a symbolic depiction of the present reign of Christ rather than a literal future **millennium**. He emphasizes the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of **Christ’s kingdom** as inaugurated in the first coming and consummated at the second, rejecting both **premillennial** and **postmillennial** readings of the passage.

- "The millennium is the period of time between the two advents of our Lord, during which Satan is restrained and the saints reign with Christ." ("A Case for Amillennialism")

## Key Works

- "A Case for Amillennialism: Understanding the End Times"
- "The Man of Sin: Uncovering the Truth About the Antichrist"
- Contributions to "Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond" (ed. Darrell L. Bock)
- Articles and lectures on Revelation 20 and eschatology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Asserts that the **millennium** is symbolic of the present church age.
    - Views the "binding of Satan" as Christ’s victory at his first coming.
    - Argues that the "first resurrection" refers to the believer’s regeneration or entrance into heaven at death.
    - Rejects a literal thousand-year earthly reign following Christ’s return.
    - "Revelation 20 describes the present reign of Christ with his saints, not a future golden age on earth." ("A Case for Amillennialism")

2. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Emphasizes the continuity between Old and New Testament promises.
    - Sees the church as the true **Israel of God**.
    - Interprets prophetic fulfillment as centered in Christ.
    - Rejects sharp distinctions between Israel and the church in eschatology.
    - "The promises made to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and shared by all who are united to him." ("A Case for Amillennialism")

3. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
    - Holds that the **kingdom of God** is already present but not yet fully consummated.
    - Christ’s resurrection and ascension mark the beginning of the end times.
    - Believers currently participate in Christ’s reign through union with him.
    - The final consummation awaits Christ’s return, not a separate millennial age.
    - "The New Testament teaches that the last days began with Christ’s first coming." ("A Case for Amillennialism")

4. **Single General Resurrection and Judgment**
    - Affirms one resurrection for both the righteous and the wicked at Christ’s return.
    - Denies a two-stage resurrection separated by a millennium.
    - Sees the final judgment as coinciding with the second coming.
    - Interprets Revelation 20’s sequence as recapitulation, not strict chronology.
    - "There is no biblical evidence for a thousand-year gap between the resurrection of believers and unbelievers." ("A Case for Amillennialism")

5. **Hermeneutic of Symbolism in Apocalyptic Literature**
    - Reads Revelation 20 as highly symbolic, not literalistic.
    - Stresses the genre and context of **apocalyptic** writing.
    - Prioritizes clear didactic passages for doctrinal formulation.
    - Uses the analogy of faith to interpret difficult texts.
    - "We must interpret the symbolic visions of Revelation in light of the clear teaching of Scripture." ("A Case for Amillennialism")

## Legacy and Impact

Riddlebarger’s robust defense of **amillennialism** has shaped contemporary Reformed eschatology, especially among those seeking a biblical-theological approach to Revelation 20. His clear articulation of inaugurated eschatology and critique of dispensationalism have influenced pastors, scholars, and lay readers alike. By emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of Christ’s kingdom, Riddlebarger has provided a compelling alternative to both premillennial and postmillennial systems.
