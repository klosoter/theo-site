# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck approached **Revelation 20 and the millennium** from a classic **Reformed amillennial** perspective, emphasizing the symbolic nature of apocalyptic literature and the unity of **redemptive history**. He rejected both **premillennialism** and **postmillennialism** as inconsistent with the overall teaching of Scripture, instead interpreting the "thousand years" as the present reign of Christ with his saints between the two advents.

- "The thousand years, accordingly, is not a future but a present reality, coinciding with the entire period between Christ’s first and second coming." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Views the millennium as a symbolic period, not a literal thousand years.
    - Identifies the millennium with the current reign of Christ from heaven.
    - Sees the binding of Satan as Christ’s victory at his first coming.
    - Argues that the "first resurrection" refers to the spiritual life of believers.
    - "The millennium is the period in which Christ rules in the midst of his enemies." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

2. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Rejects sharp discontinuities between Old and New Testament eschatology.
    - Emphasizes the fulfillment of Old Testament promises in Christ.
    - Sees the church as the continuation of God’s covenant people.
    - Argues that Revelation 20 must be read in light of the whole biblical narrative.
    - "The new dispensation is not a parenthesis but the fulfillment of the old." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

3. **Symbolic and Apocalyptic Hermeneutic**
    - Interprets Revelation as apocalyptic literature, rich in symbolism.
    - Warns against literalistic readings of numbers and images.
    - Maintains that the "thousand years" is a figurative expression.
    - Sees the visions as depicting spiritual realities, not chronological sequences.
    - "The apocalyptic style of Revelation demands a spiritual interpretation." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

4. **Rejection of Premillennialism and Postmillennialism**
    - Critiques premillennialism for introducing a future earthly reign.
    - Rejects postmillennialism’s expectation of a golden age before Christ’s return.
    - Argues both views distort the New Testament’s teaching on the kingdom.
    - Maintains that the final consummation comes only at Christ’s second coming.
    - "Scripture knows nothing of a future earthly kingdom before the eternal state." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

5. **Consummation at Christ’s Return**
    - Teaches that the resurrection, final judgment, and new creation occur together.
    - Denies any intermediate state of earthly glory after Christ’s return.
    - Affirms the immediacy of the eternal state following the parousia.
    - Sees the hope of believers as focused on the new heavens and new earth.
    - "The second coming of Christ brings the end, the resurrection, and the renewal of all things." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s **amillennial** reading of Revelation 20 has profoundly shaped modern Reformed eschatology, providing a robust theological alternative to both dispensational and postmillennial schemes. His emphasis on the unity of **redemptive history** and the symbolic interpretation of apocalyptic texts continues to influence contemporary biblical theology. Bavinck’s careful exegesis and commitment to the confessional Reformed tradition make his work a standard reference for understanding the millennium within orthodox Protestant thought.
