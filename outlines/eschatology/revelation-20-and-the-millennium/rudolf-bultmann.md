# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **Revelation 20 and the millennium** through his program of **demythologization**, arguing that apocalyptic imagery should not be interpreted literally but as existential symbols. He rejected traditional **millennialism** and instead emphasized the **kerygma**—the proclamation of Christ—as the true focus of New Testament eschatology, seeing the **apocalyptic language** as expressing the existential reality of decision and faith.

- "The mythical eschatology is untenable for modern man; what matters is the existential understanding of the message." ("New Testament and Mythology")

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (in Kerygma and Myth)
- Theology of the New Testament
- History and Eschatology
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- "Is Exegesis without Presuppositions Possible?"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Apocalyptic Imagery**
    - Apocalyptic texts, including Revelation 20, use mythic language that must be reinterpreted for modern understanding.
    - The millennium is not a literal future event but a symbol for existential realities.
    - The focus shifts from cosmic chronology to the individual's encounter with the **kerygma**.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind the myth.
    - "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." ("New Testament and Mythology")

2. **Existential Interpretation of Eschatology**
    - Eschatological passages are interpreted through the lens of **existentialism**, especially influenced by Heidegger.
    - The "millennium" becomes a metaphor for the individual's decision in the present.
    - The true "end" is the moment of faith, not a future historical event.
    - The urgency of eschatology is internalized as the call to authentic existence.
    - "Eschatology is not a doctrine of future events, but an expression of the possibility of decision here and now." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Literal Millennialism**
    - Bultmann dismisses premillennial, postmillennial, and amillennial readings as missing the existential point.
    - He sees the expectation of a literal thousand-year reign as a relic of ancient cosmology.
    - The church's hope is not in a future earthly kingdom but in the proclamation of Christ.
    - The apocalyptic hope is fulfilled in the present encounter with the risen Lord.
    - "The expectation of a future kingdom of God is a mythological expression of the meaning of existence disclosed in the kerygma." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ's death and resurrection is the heart of the New Testament message.
    - Apocalyptic imagery, including the millennium, serves to highlight the urgency of the kerygma.
    - Faith is not assent to future predictions but trust in the present word of Christ.
    - The kerygma calls for existential decision, not speculative chronology.
    - "What matters is not the apocalyptic expectation, but the call to decision in the kerygma." (Kerygma and Myth)

5. **Critique of Historicism and Futurism**
    - Bultmann opposes both historicist and futurist readings of Revelation 20.
    - He argues that attempts to correlate biblical prophecy with historical events miss the existential message.
    - The millennium is not a timetable for history but a symbol for the crisis of faith.
    - The true fulfillment of prophecy is in the existential encounter with the gospel.
    - "The apocalyptic world-view is only the clothing of the message; its truth lies in the existential challenge it presents." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's approach to **Revelation 20 and the millennium** profoundly shaped modern critical scholarship by shifting focus from literal or historicist readings to existential interpretation. His method of **demythologization** influenced generations of theologians and biblical scholars, especially in the realm of New Testament eschatology. While controversial, his insistence on the centrality of the **kerygma** and the existential dimension of faith continues to provoke discussion and debate in both academic and ecclesial contexts.
