# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin approached **Revelation 20** and the **millennium** from a classic **Reformed amillennial** perspective, emphasizing the symbolic nature of the passage and its fulfillment in the present reign of Christ. He rejected **chiliasm** (premillennialism) and argued that the **millennial reign** described in Revelation is spiritual, corresponding to the period between Christ’s first and second comings. Turretin’s exegesis is marked by a commitment to the **analogy of faith** and the unity of **redemptive history**.

- "We do not expect a future thousand-year reign of Christ on earth, but understand the millennium as the spiritual reign of Christ with his saints." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Commentarius in Apocalypsin (Commentary on Revelation) [fragments and notes]
- Selected writings in Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (ed. Richard Muller)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Chiliasm (Premillennialism)**
    - Argues that a literal thousand-year earthly reign is inconsistent with the broader teaching of Scripture.
    - Views chiliasm as a Jewish error revived by some early Christian writers.
    - Emphasizes the spiritual nature of Christ’s kingdom, not a political or earthly one.
    - Sees the millennium as already inaugurated with Christ’s resurrection and ascension.
    - "The opinion of the Chiliasts is to be rejected, as it is repugnant to the analogy of faith." (Institutes, 3.18.5)

2. **Symbolic Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Interprets the "thousand years" as a symbolic period, not a literal duration.
    - Considers apocalyptic literature to be highly figurative and not to be pressed for literal chronology.
    - Connects the binding of Satan to Christ’s first coming and the spread of the gospel.
    - Sees the "first resurrection" as spiritual (regeneration), not bodily.
    - "The thousand years signify the entire time of the church’s spiritual reign, not a literal millennium." (Institutes, 3.18.6)

3. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Stresses the continuity between Old and New Testament people of God.
    - Denies a future, separate dispensation for ethnic Israel in the millennium.
    - Affirms that all promises find their fulfillment in Christ and his church.
    - Rejects any postponement of Christ’s kingdom to a future age.
    - "There is one people of God, and one way of salvation in all ages." (Institutes, 3.18.7)

4. **Analogy of Faith in Eschatology**
    - Insists that obscure passages (like Revelation 20) must be interpreted in light of clear ones.
    - Uses the analogy of faith to harmonize Revelation 20 with the rest of Scripture.
    - Prioritizes didactic passages over apocalyptic visions for doctrinal formulation.
    - Warns against constructing eschatology on a single, symbolic text.
    - "We must not build doctrines on the dark places of Scripture, but on those which are plain." (Institutes, 3.18.8)

5. **Spiritual Reign of Christ and the Saints**
    - Teaches that Christ currently reigns from heaven, and believers share in this reign spiritually.
    - The "millennium" is the age of the church, marked by the advance of the gospel and the restraint of Satan.
    - The final defeat of Satan and the general resurrection occur at Christ’s return, not before.
    - The hope of believers is fixed on the consummation, not an earthly golden age.
    - "The reign of the saints is now, in union with Christ, not in a future earthly kingdom." (Institutes, 3.18.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s **amillennial** reading of Revelation 20 became a standard position in the Reformed tradition, shaping later confessional documents and systematic theologies. His careful exegesis and commitment to the **analogy of faith** provided a robust framework for interpreting apocalyptic literature. Turretin’s influence endures in Reformed eschatology, particularly in the rejection of **chiliasm** and the affirmation of the spiritual reign of Christ and his church. His legacy is evident in the ongoing preference for symbolic and redemptive-historical readings of Revelation within confessional Reformed circles.
