# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther approached **Revelation 20** and the **millennium** with caution, rejecting speculative interpretations and distancing himself from both **premillennialism** and **postmillennialism**. He emphasized the **Christocentric** focus of Scripture, viewing the millennium symbolically as the reign of Christ through the **Gospel** and the **Church**, rather than as a literal thousand-year earthly kingdom.

- "For the book of Revelation is, in truth, a hidden and dark prophecy, though it is clear that it prophesies about the struggles and tribulations of Christendom." (Preface to Revelation, 1522)

## Key Works

- Preface to the Revelation of St. John (1522)
- Lectures on Daniel (1518–1521)
- Sermons on the Book of Revelation (various)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 35: Word and Sacrament I (selected writings on eschatology)
- Table Talk (collected sayings on prophecy and the end times)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Millenarianism**
    - Opposed literal interpretations of the thousand years in Revelation 20.
    - Viewed millenarian movements as dangerous and disruptive to the Church.
    - Saw the millennium as a spiritual reality, not a future earthly event.
    - Warned against date-setting and speculative eschatology.
    - "They are dreaming who think that before the Day of Judgment the Christians are to have a worldly kingdom." (Preface to Revelation, 1522)

2. **Christ Reigns Now Through the Gospel**
    - Identified the reign of Christ with the present age of the Church.
    - Emphasized the power of the **Word** and **Sacraments** as the means of Christ’s rule.
    - Saw the defeat of Satan as inaugurated by Christ’s first coming.
    - Interpreted the binding of Satan as the restraint of his power through the Gospel.
    - "The Gospel is the true kingdom of Christ, where He reigns by His Word and Spirit." (Sermons on Revelation)

3. **Symbolic Interpretation of Revelation**
    - Treated apocalyptic imagery as symbolic, not literal.
    - Interpreted the thousand years as a figurative period.
    - Saw Revelation as describing the ongoing struggle between the Church and its enemies.
    - Focused on the comfort Revelation provides to persecuted believers.
    - "Let everyone regard the Book of Revelation as a picture and symbol of the whole Christian Church." (Preface to Revelation, 1522)

4. **Eschatological Already/Not Yet**
    - Affirmed that Christ’s victory is already accomplished but not yet fully consummated.
    - The final defeat of evil awaits the Second Coming.
    - The Church lives in the tension between present suffering and future hope.
    - The millennium is not a distinct future era but the present age of the Church.
    - "We are now in the last times, and the devil is bound only so far as the Gospel is preached." (Table Talk)

5. **Centrality of Christ in Eschatology**
    - All prophecy and eschatology must be interpreted through the person and work of Christ.
    - Rejected speculative schemes that distract from the Gospel.
    - Emphasized faith in Christ’s promises over curiosity about end-times details.
    - Saw the ultimate hope as the return of Christ and the resurrection of the dead.
    - "Let us not be concerned with times and seasons, but with Christ Himself, who is our salvation." (Lectures on Daniel)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s symbolic and **Christocentric** approach to Revelation 20 shaped the mainstream **Lutheran** and broader **Protestant** rejection of millenarianism. His emphasis on the present reign of Christ through the Gospel influenced later **amillennial** interpretations. By prioritizing the clarity of the Gospel over speculative eschatology, Luther set a precedent for focusing on the essentials of Christian hope rather than detailed prophetic schemes. His legacy endures in the caution and restraint with which many Reformed and Lutheran theologians approach apocalyptic texts.
