# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **Revelation 20 and the millennium** through the lens of **Reformed eschatology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of Christ’s victory, critiquing both **premillennialism** and **postmillennialism** for their failure to maintain a consistently biblical worldview. For Van Til, the millennium is best understood within the framework of **covenant theology** and the already/not yet tension of the **kingdom of God**.

- "The Reformed position is that the kingdom of God is essentially redemptive and spiritual, and that its consummation awaits the return of Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith (especially discussions on eschatology and the kingdom)
- Christian Apologetics
- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture and Authority
- Essays in Christian Education (for implications of worldview and history)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
    - Interprets Revelation 20 within the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - Rejects atomistic or literalist readings that separate the millennium from Christ’s work.
    - Emphasizes the unity of Scripture and the centrality of Christ.
    - Views the millennium as symbolic of the church age, not a future earthly reign.
    - "The whole of history is the outworking of God’s redemptive plan in Christ." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenant Theology as Framework**
    - Sees the millennium as part of the administration of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Stresses continuity between Old and New Testaments regarding the people of God.
    - Argues that the promises of the millennium are fulfilled in Christ and his body.
    - Rejects dispensational distinctions that separate Israel and the church.
    - "The covenant is the framework within which all of God’s redemptive acts must be understood." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Critique of Premillennialism**
    - Opposes a literal thousand-year reign of Christ on earth after his return.
    - Argues premillennialism undermines the sufficiency of Christ’s first coming.
    - Sees premillennialism as inconsistent with the Reformed doctrine of the kingdom.
    - Emphasizes the present reign of Christ and the inaugurated kingdom.
    - "Premillennialism fails to do justice to the present reality of Christ’s kingship." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - Affirms the kingdom is inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - Interprets the millennium as the period between Christ’s first and second comings.
    - Stresses the tension between present spiritual realities and future fulfillment.
    - Maintains that Satan is bound in a real but limited sense during this age.
    - "The Christian lives in the tension of the already and the not yet." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Presuppositional Critique of Competing Views**
    - Evaluates millennial views based on their underlying presuppositions.
    - Argues that only the Reformed, covenantal approach is consistently biblical.
    - Critiques secular and dispensational eschatologies for adopting autonomous reasoning.
    - Insists that eschatology must be grounded in the self-attesting Christ of Scripture.
    - "All reasoning about the future must begin with the presupposition of God’s revelation." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **Revelation 20 and the millennium** reinforced the Reformed tradition’s commitment to a covenantal and redemptive-historical reading of Scripture. His presuppositional method shaped generations of theologians to approach eschatology with a robustly biblical worldview. By critiquing alternative millennial schemes, Van Til helped solidify the **amillennial** consensus within confessional Reformed circles and underscored the importance of Christ’s present reign in the life of the church. His influence endures in both systematic theology and apologetics.
