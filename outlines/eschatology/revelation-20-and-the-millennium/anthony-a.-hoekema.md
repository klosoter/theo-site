# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema was a leading proponent of **amillennialism**, interpreting **Revelation 20** as a symbolic depiction of the present reign of Christ rather than a literal future **millennium**. He emphasized the unity of **redemptive history** and the inaugurated nature of the **kingdom of God**, rejecting both **premillennial** and **postmillennial** readings as inconsistent with the New Testament’s eschatology.

- "The thousand years of Revelation 20 is a symbolic number, describing the entire period between Christ’s first and second comings." (The Bible and the Future)

## Key Works

- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- "Amillennialism" in The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views (1977)
- Created in God’s Image (1986) [for broader theological context]
- "The Reformed Position" in The Millennium: Four Views (1977)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - The "thousand years" is a symbolic period, not a literal future era.
    - The binding of Satan refers to his restraint from deceiving the nations during the present age.
    - The "first resurrection" is spiritual, denoting believers’ regeneration or the intermediate state.
    - The passage describes the church age, not a future earthly reign.
    - "The millennium of Revelation 20 is the present reign of the souls of believers with Christ in heaven." (The Bible and the Future)

2. **Unity of redemptive history**
    - Rejects a sharp division between Israel and the church.
    - Sees the fulfillment of Old Testament promises in the New Testament church.
    - Argues that all of history moves toward a single consummation at Christ’s return.
    - Denies a future, separate Jewish millennium.
    - "The New Testament teaches only one return of Christ, one general resurrection, and one final judgment." (The Bible and the Future)

3. **Inaugurated eschatology**
    - The kingdom of God is already present, though not yet fully consummated.
    - Believers presently experience aspects of the resurrection life.
    - The church participates in Christ’s reign now, not just in the future.
    - The "already/not yet" framework shapes his reading of Revelation 20.
    - "We are now living in the last days, the time of fulfillment." (The Bible and the Future)

4. **Rejection of premillennialism and postmillennialism**
    - Critiques premillennialism for introducing a future earthly kingdom distinct from the eternal state.
    - Argues postmillennialism is overly optimistic about the church’s influence before Christ’s return.
    - Maintains that both views misread the symbolic nature of apocalyptic literature.
    - Emphasizes the finality and completeness of Christ’s second coming.
    - "Neither premillennialism nor postmillennialism does justice to the biblical teaching about the end times." (The Bible and the Future)

5. **Eschatological hope centered on Christ’s return**
    - The ultimate hope is the visible, glorious return of Christ.
    - The final judgment, resurrection, and new creation occur together.
    - Believers’ present reign with Christ anticipates the fullness of the new heavens and new earth.
    - The millennium points to the security and victory believers have in Christ now.
    - "Our hope is not in a future millennium, but in the coming of our Lord and the renewal of all things." (The Bible and the Future)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s robust defense of **amillennialism** has shaped Reformed and evangelical eschatology, providing a clear alternative to dispensational and historic premillennial views. His careful exegesis of **Revelation 20** and emphasis on the unity of **redemptive history** continue to influence pastors, scholars, and students. Hoekema’s work remains a standard reference for those seeking a biblically grounded, theologically coherent understanding of the millennium.
