# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **Revelation 20** and the question of the **millennium** from a perspective shaped by his **dialectical theology** and Christocentric focus. He rejected literalist or historicist readings, emphasizing the symbolic nature of apocalyptic literature and the centrality of **Christ’s eschatological victory**. Brunner saw the millennium as a theological affirmation of **God’s ultimate sovereignty** rather than a timetable for history.

- "The kingdom of God is not a program for the future, but the certainty of the Lordship of Christ over all history." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Eternal Hope
- Truth as Encounter
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation 20 is Symbolic, Not Chronological**
    - Interprets the **millennium** as a symbol of Christ’s reign, not a literal thousand-year period.
    - Argues that apocalyptic language in Revelation is inherently figurative.
    - Rejects both premillennial and postmillennial schemes as speculative.
    - Emphasizes the present reality of Christ’s victory over evil.
    - "The thousand years is the symbol of the time of the Church, the time of the Gospel." (The Eternal Hope)

2. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - Centers all eschatological hope on the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Views the final victory over evil as accomplished in Christ’s resurrection.
    - Sees the millennium as an aspect of the already/not yet tension in Christian hope.
    - Insists that the future is determined by Christ, not by human calculation.
    - "The decisive event has already happened in Christ; the end is the manifestation of what is already true." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

3. **Rejection of Millenarianism**
    - Critiques millenarianism as a distraction from the gospel’s true focus.
    - Warns against speculative eschatology that undermines faith in God’s sovereignty.
    - Argues that millenarian hopes often lead to political or social utopianism.
    - Stresses the sufficiency of faith in Christ for assurance about the future.
    - "Christian faith does not rest on visions of a coming age, but on the certainty of Christ’s lordship." (The Eternal Hope)

4. **Eschatology as Ethical Motivation**
    - Sees eschatological hope as energizing Christian responsibility in the present.
    - Argues that the reality of Christ’s reign calls believers to active service.
    - Rejects escapist or passive attitudes toward history and society.
    - Connects the hope of the new creation with ethical transformation now.
    - "The expectation of the end is not flight from the world, but the power to serve in it." (Truth as Encounter)

5. **God’s Sovereignty and Human History**
    - Affirms that **God’s sovereignty** encompasses all of history, including the ambiguous present.
    - Interprets the millennium as a sign of God’s ultimate purpose, not a blueprint for human action.
    - Maintains that evil is real but ultimately defeated in Christ.
    - Encourages trust in God’s providence rather than anxiety about end-times details.
    - "History is in God’s hands, and the future belongs to Him alone." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s interpretation of **Revelation 20** and the millennium influenced 20th-century Protestant eschatology by steering attention away from speculative chronology toward the **centrality of Christ** and the ethical implications of Christian hope. His symbolic reading of apocalyptic texts contributed to a broader theological movement that prioritized the **already/not yet** tension in eschatology. Brunner’s work remains significant for those seeking a theologically robust, non-literalist approach to the millennium and the book of Revelation.
