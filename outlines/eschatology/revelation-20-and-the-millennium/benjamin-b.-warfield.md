# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached **Revelation 20 and the millennium** from a decidedly **amillennial** perspective, interpreting the passage symbolically rather than as a literal future thousand-year reign. He argued that the **millennium** represents the current reign of Christ with his saints in the intermediate state, emphasizing the **unity of the eschatological hope** and the **finality of Christ’s second coming**.

- "The entire book is a picture, not of the history of the world, nor of the church, but of the church in the world." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse," in Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "The Millennium and the Apocalypse" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Apocalypse" (in Revelation and Inspiration)
- Selected articles in The Presbyterian and Reformed Review
- "The Gospel of the Resurrection"
- "The Plan of Salvation"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Views the "thousand years" as a symbolic period representing the present church age.
    - Rejects a literal earthly reign of Christ prior to the final judgment.
    - Sees the binding of Satan as Christ’s victory at the cross, limiting his power to deceive the nations.
    - Interprets the "first resurrection" as the entrance of believers into the intermediate state.
    - "The thousand years is the whole interval between the first and second advents of Christ." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

2. **Unity of the Second Coming**
    - Argues that Scripture presents a single, climactic return of Christ.
    - Denies any division between a secret rapture and a later visible return.
    - Asserts that the resurrection, judgment, and consummation all occur at Christ’s second coming.
    - Emphasizes the finality and universality of the last judgment.
    - "There is no room in the New Testament for a coming of Christ in two stages." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

3. **Symbolic Hermeneutic for Apocalyptic Literature**
    - Reads Revelation as a book of symbols, not a chronological prophecy.
    - Maintains that apocalyptic imagery conveys theological truths, not precise timelines.
    - Stresses the importance of interpreting difficult passages in light of clearer Scripture.
    - Warns against speculative eschatology based on obscure texts.
    - "The book of Revelation is a book of symbols, and its numbers are symbolical." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

4. **Present Reign of Christ and the Saints**
    - Teaches that Christ currently reigns from heaven with departed believers.
    - Identifies the "reigning" saints in Revelation 20 as those who have died in Christ.
    - Connects the "first resurrection" to the believer’s entrance into glory after death.
    - Sees the church’s victory as spiritual, not political or earthly.
    - "The reigning with Christ is the reigning of the souls of the martyrs in heaven." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

5. **Eschatological Hope Centered on the New Creation**
    - Locates Christian hope in the final resurrection and new heavens and earth.
    - Rejects any expectation of a golden age prior to Christ’s return.
    - Emphasizes the consummation of redemption at the end of history.
    - Affirms the continuity of God’s redemptive plan from cross to consummation.
    - "The hope of the church is not in a millennium, but in the coming of her Lord." ("The Millennium and the Apocalypse")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s **amillennial** reading of Revelation 20 shaped much of twentieth-century Reformed eschatology, providing a robust alternative to both **premillennialism** and **postmillennialism**. His insistence on the symbolic nature of apocalyptic literature and the unity of the second coming influenced generations of biblical scholars and pastors. Warfield’s careful exegesis and theological clarity continue to serve as a standard for Reformed engagement with eschatological questions.
