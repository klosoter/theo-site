# Sam Storms (1951– )

Sam Storms is a leading advocate of **amillennialism**, interpreting **Revelation 20** as a symbolic depiction of the present reign of Christ rather than a literal future **millennium**. He emphasizes the unity of **redemptive history** and the fulfillment of **Old Testament prophecy** in Christ, rejecting a future earthly reign distinct from the current church age.

- "The so-called 'millennium' of Revelation 20:1-6 is not a future earthly golden age but the present reign of Christ with his saints in the intermediate state." (Kingdom Come)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Come: The Amillennial Alternative
- The Beginner’s Guide to Spiritual Warfare
- Tough Topics: Biblical Answers to 25 Challenging Questions
- The Millennium: Literal or Figurative? (various articles and lectures)
- Are We Living in the Last Days? (sermons and online resources)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Views the "thousand years" as a symbolic period representing the current church age.
    - Rejects a literal, earthly reign of Christ following his return.
    - Argues that the binding of Satan refers to his restriction from deceiving the nations regarding the gospel.
    - Sees the "first resurrection" as the believer’s entrance into the intermediate state with Christ.
    - "The millennium is now; it is the present reign of the souls of deceased believers with Christ in heaven." (Kingdom Come)

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment of Prophecy**
    - Asserts that all **Old Testament promises** find their fulfillment in Jesus Christ.
    - Denies a future, nationalistic fulfillment for ethnic Israel apart from the church.
    - Emphasizes the unity of the people of God across both Testaments.
    - Interprets prophetic imagery through a **typological** lens.
    - "All of God’s promises are yes and amen in Christ, not in a future earthly kingdom." (Kingdom Come)

3. **Single Consummation of History**
    - Affirms one climactic return of Christ, not multiple stages.
    - Teaches that the **resurrection of the righteous and the wicked** occurs simultaneously.
    - Rejects a gap between Christ’s return and the final judgment.
    - Sees the new creation inaugurated at Christ’s second coming.
    - "There is no biblical warrant for a two-stage return of Christ or a temporal gap between resurrection and judgment." (Kingdom Come)

4. **Symbolic Hermeneutic for Apocalyptic Literature**
    - Interprets **Revelation 20** and related passages as apocalyptic symbolism, not literal chronology.
    - Stresses the importance of genre in interpreting prophetic texts.
    - Argues that numbers and images in Revelation convey theological truths, not precise timelines.
    - Maintains that the book’s structure is cyclical, not strictly sequential.
    - "The thousand years is a symbolic number, denoting a long but indeterminate period." (Kingdom Come)

5. **Present Spiritual Reign of Christ**
    - Teaches that Christ currently reigns from heaven over his people.
    - Believers participate in this reign through union with Christ.
    - The defeat of Satan is inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - The church’s mission is empowered by Christ’s present authority.
    - "We are already, in a very real sense, seated with Christ in the heavenly places." (Kingdom Come)

## Legacy and Impact

Sam Storms has played a significant role in popularizing **amillennialism** among evangelical readers, especially through accessible works that bridge scholarly exegesis and pastoral application. His Christ-centered reading of **Revelation 20** has challenged dispensational and premillennial paradigms, encouraging a holistic approach to **biblical eschatology**. Storms’ influence extends through his teaching, writing, and online presence, shaping contemporary discussions on the millennium and the interpretation of apocalyptic literature.
