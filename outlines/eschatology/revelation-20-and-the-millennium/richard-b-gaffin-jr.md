# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading contemporary Reformed theologian whose interpretation of **Revelation 20** and the **millennium** is shaped by his commitment to **inaugurated eschatology** and a redemptive-historical reading of Scripture. Gaffin rejects **premillennialism** and **postmillennialism**, instead affirming an **amillennial** position that sees the "thousand years" as symbolizing the present reign of Christ and the saints between His first and second comings.

- "The millennium is not a future earthly golden age but the present reign of Christ with his saints in heaven." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- "The Millennium" in The New Bible Dictionary (co-authored with Anthony N. Hoekema)
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1977)
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "A Response to the Premillennial View" in Three Views of the Millennium and Beyond (ed. Darrell L. Bock)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - The "thousand years" is a symbolic period, not a literal future era.
    - It represents the present age between Christ’s resurrection and return.
    - The binding of Satan refers to his restriction from deceiving the nations during the gospel era.
    - The "first resurrection" is best understood as the believer’s entrance into heavenly life at death.
    - "The millennium is the present reign of deceased believers with Christ in heaven." (The New Bible Dictionary)

2. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
    - The "already/not yet" structure governs New Testament eschatology.
    - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the new creation and the kingdom.
    - The final consummation awaits Christ’s return, not a millennial age.
    - The church lives in the overlap of the ages, experiencing both suffering and victory.
    - "The eschatological age has been inaugurated but not yet consummated." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
    - Revelation 20 must be interpreted in light of the whole biblical storyline.
    - Old Testament prophecy is fulfilled in Christ and the church, not in a future Jewish millennium.
    - The book of Revelation uses apocalyptic imagery to depict present spiritual realities.
    - The focus is on Christ’s victory and the perseverance of the saints, not on earthly chronology.
    - "The New Testament consistently interprets Old Testament prophecy in terms of Christ’s first and second comings." (Theonomy and Eschatology)

4. **Rejection of Premillennialism and Postmillennialism**
    - Premillennialism introduces an unbiblical separation between resurrection and final judgment.
    - Postmillennialism overestimates the progress of the church before Christ’s return.
    - Both systems misread the symbolic nature of apocalyptic literature.
    - The New Testament expects tribulation and perseverance, not a golden age before the end.
    - "Neither premillennialism nor postmillennialism does justice to the New Testament’s eschatological tension." (Theonomy and Eschatology)

5. **Centrality of Christ’s Resurrection and Parousia**
    - The resurrection of Christ is the decisive eschatological event.
    - The final resurrection and judgment occur at Christ’s return, not separated by a millennium.
    - The hope of believers is focused on the new heavens and new earth, not a temporary earthly reign.
    - The millennium underscores the present reality of union with Christ for departed saints.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the end; his return will bring its consummation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust defense of **amillennialism** has significantly shaped Reformed eschatological thought, especially within the Westminster tradition. His emphasis on **inaugurated eschatology** and a redemptive-historical approach to Revelation 20 has provided a framework for interpreting apocalyptic texts in continuity with the rest of Scripture. Gaffin’s work continues to influence pastors, scholars, and students seeking a biblically grounded understanding of the millennium that centers on Christ’s finished work and future return.
