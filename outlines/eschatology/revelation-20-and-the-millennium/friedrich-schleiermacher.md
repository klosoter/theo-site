# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached **Revelation 20 and the millennium** through his distinctive emphasis on the **religious consciousness** and the **feeling of absolute dependence**, rather than traditional eschatological speculation. He interpreted **apocalyptic texts** like Revelation symbolically, viewing the millennium as an expression of the church’s spiritual progress rather than a literal future event. For Schleiermacher, the focus remained on the **ethical transformation** of the community and the realization of the **kingdom of God** within history.

- "The kingdom of God is not a future event to be awaited, but a present reality to be realized in the life of the church." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Symbolic Interpretation of Apocalyptic Texts**
    - Revelation 20 is read as a symbolic narrative, not a literal prophecy.
    - Apocalyptic imagery expresses the church’s hope and spiritual aspirations.
    - The millennium signifies the moral and spiritual development of the Christian community.
    - Emphasis is placed on the transformative power of faith rather than chronological predictions.
    - "The language of prophecy is the language of religious feeling, not of historical calculation." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Primacy of Religious Consciousness**
    - Eschatological passages are interpreted through the lens of religious experience.
    - The millennium reflects the deepening of the church’s awareness of God’s presence.
    - Personal and communal transformation is prioritized over external events.
    - The focus is on the subjective appropriation of redemption.
    - "All doctrines must be rooted in the feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Ethical Realization of the Kingdom of God**
    - The kingdom is realized through ethical living and communal love.
    - The millennium is a metaphor for the church’s mission in the world.
    - Social and moral progress are signs of God’s reign.
    - The church’s calling is to embody the kingdom in present reality.
    - "The kingdom of God is the highest good, realized in the ethical life of the community." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Continuity of Divine Revelation**
    - Revelation is ongoing and dynamic within the life of the church.
    - The Spirit continues to guide the community toward truth.
    - Apocalyptic visions are part of the unfolding self-disclosure of God.
    - The millennium is one stage in the progressive revelation of God’s purposes.
    - "Revelation is not a closed event but a living reality in the church." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Rejection of Chiliasm (Millenarianism)**
    - Schleiermacher explicitly rejects literal millennialism.
    - He views chiliasm as a misunderstanding of Christian hope.
    - The expectation of a temporal reign of Christ is seen as a distraction from true faith.
    - The church’s mission is spiritual, not political or earthly.
    - "Chiliasm is a foreign element in Christian doctrine, incompatible with its spiritual nature." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **Revelation 20 and the millennium** profoundly shaped modern **liberal theology** by shifting the focus from literal eschatology to the ethical and spiritual dimensions of Christian hope. His symbolic reading of apocalyptic texts influenced subsequent theologians to interpret the **kingdom of God** as a present, transformative reality within the church. While his rejection of traditional millennialism distanced him from orthodox positions, his emphasis on religious experience and ethical progress continues to inform contemporary theological discussions on eschatology.
