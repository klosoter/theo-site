# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge interpreted **Revelation 20 and the millennium** through a classic **Reformed amillennial** lens, emphasizing the symbolic nature of the passage and its fulfillment in the present reign of Christ. He rejected both **premillennialism** and **postmillennialism** as inconsistent with the broader teaching of **Scripture**, arguing that the **millennium** represents the spiritual victory of the church rather than a literal thousand-year earthly reign.

- "The whole passage is highly figurative, and must be interpreted in accordance with the analogy of Scripture." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
   - The thousand years symbolize the current reign of Christ with His saints.
   - The binding of Satan refers to the restraint of his power during the gospel age.
   - The "first resurrection" is spiritual, not bodily, referring to regeneration or the souls of believers in heaven.
   - The passage should be interpreted in harmony with the rest of **Scripture**.
   "The reign of the saints is not a visible, earthly kingdom, but the spiritual dominion of the church." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Rejection of Premillennialism**
   - Premillennialism is inconsistent with the unity of Christ’s second coming.
   - Scripture does not teach a two-stage return of Christ.
   - The resurrection and final judgment occur together, not separated by a millennium.
   - The hope of the church is focused on Christ’s return, not an earthly golden age.
   "There is no intimation in the New Testament of a coming of Christ to reign on earth before the final judgment." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Symbolic Reading of Apocalyptic Literature**
   - Apocalyptic texts employ symbols that must be interpreted contextually.
   - Literalism leads to confusion and doctrinal error.
   - The purpose of Revelation is to comfort and exhort, not to provide a detailed chronology.
   - The millennium is a symbol of the triumph of the gospel, not a calendar period.
   "The language of prophecy is necessarily figurative, and must be so understood." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Unity of Redemptive History**
   - The church is the continuation of God’s people from the Old Testament.
   - There is one people of God, not a separate destiny for Israel and the church.
   - The promises of the kingdom are fulfilled in Christ and His church.
   - The consummation of history is marked by the resurrection and final judgment.
   "The church is the true Israel, and all the promises are fulfilled in her." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Christ’s Present Reign**
   - Christ is now reigning at the right hand of the Father.
   - The kingdom advances through the preaching of the gospel.
   - The defeat of Satan is progressive but assured.
   - The final victory will be manifested at Christ’s return, not before.
   "The present dispensation is the reign of Christ, and the millennium is but its symbolical representation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s **amillennial** interpretation of Revelation 20 became a standard position within the **Reformed tradition**, shaping generations of Presbyterian and Reformed theologians. His insistence on the symbolic reading of apocalyptic texts reinforced a cautious, Christ-centered approach to eschatology. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary Reformed discussions of the millennium, especially in his emphasis on the unity of **redemptive history** and the present reign of Christ. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a biblically grounded, theologically coherent understanding of eschatology.
