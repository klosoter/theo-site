# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til did not develop a distinctive position on **millennial views** but approached eschatology through the lens of his **presuppositional apologetics** and commitment to **Reformed theology**. He emphasized the importance of interpreting **biblical prophecy** and **eschatological hope** within a consistently **covenantal** and **Christocentric** framework, cautioning against speculative systems that undermine the unity of Scripture.

- "The Reformed faith does not separate the doctrine of the last things from the rest of theology, but sees it as integrally related to the whole counsel of God." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- Common Grace and the Gospel

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenantal Unity of Scripture**
    - Stressed that **eschatology** must be interpreted in light of the unity of God's redemptive plan.
    - Opposed systems (like classic dispensationalism) that fragment the biblical narrative.
    - Saw the **covenant of grace** as the context for understanding all prophetic fulfillment.
    - Emphasized continuity between Old and New Testaments regarding the kingdom of God.
    - "The covenantal structure of Scripture is the foundation for all theological interpretation." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - Asserted that all **eschatological hope** centers on the person and work of Christ.
    - Rejected interpretations that diminish Christ’s centrality in the consummation.
    - Interpreted millennial passages as ultimately fulfilled in Christ’s reign.
    - Warned against speculative timelines that distract from the gospel.
    - "All of history moves toward the consummation in Christ." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Critique of Dispensationalism**
    - Criticized dispensational premillennialism for its dualistic separation of Israel and the church.
    - Saw such systems as inconsistent with **Reformed hermeneutics**.
    - Emphasized the danger of reading prophecy apart from the analogy of faith.
    - Upheld the unity of God’s people across redemptive history.
    - "Dispensationalism fails to do justice to the unity of God’s redemptive work." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Presuppositional Approach to Prophecy**
    - Applied his apologetic method to the interpretation of prophetic texts.
    - Insisted that one’s worldview shapes eschatological conclusions.
    - Urged that all millennial views be tested by the presuppositions of **biblical revelation**.
    - Opposed naturalistic or rationalistic readings of prophecy.
    - "One’s basic presuppositions determine the outcome of one’s eschatology." (Christian Apologetics)

5. **Eschatology as Motivation for Faithful Living**
    - Taught that eschatology should foster hope and perseverance, not speculation.
    - Warned against date-setting or unhealthy preoccupation with millennial schemes.
    - Emphasized the ethical implications of Christ’s return for the church.
    - Saw the future consummation as a call to present obedience and witness.
    - "The Christian’s hope is not in a timetable, but in the sure promise of Christ’s coming." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **millennial views** shaped generations of Reformed theologians to interpret eschatology within a robustly covenantal and Christ-centered framework. His critique of **dispensationalism** and insistence on the unity of Scripture influenced both academic theology and pastoral ministry. While not offering a novel millennial scheme, Van Til’s presuppositional method continues to inform Reformed engagement with eschatological debates. His legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on the integration of **biblical theology** and apologetics in discussions of the last things.
