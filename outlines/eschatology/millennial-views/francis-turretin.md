# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin approached **millennial views** with a cautious and critical eye, firmly upholding the **amillennial** position typical of the Reformed tradition. He rejected both **premillennialism** (chiliasm) and **postmillennialism** as inconsistent with the **analogy of faith** and the **literal-figurative hermeneutic** of Scripture, emphasizing the spiritual nature of Christ’s kingdom and the unity of the **eschatological consummation**.

- "We reject the millennium of the Chiliasts as a Jewish dream, and maintain that the church will not enjoy a carnal kingdom before the final resurrection." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 3.23.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 3, Topics 23 and 24)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected sermons and disputations on eschatology
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism" (for context on Turretin’s eschatology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Premillennialism (Chiliasm)**
   - Argues that a literal thousand-year reign is not supported by the overall teaching of Scripture.
   - Views chiliasm as a revival of Jewish expectations, inconsistent with the New Testament.
   - Emphasizes the symbolic interpretation of Revelation 20.
   - Asserts that the resurrection and final judgment occur simultaneously, not separated by a millennium.
   - "We think that the thousand years in Revelation are to be understood figuratively, not literally." (Institutes, 3.23.6)

2. **Affirmation of Amillennialism**
   - Teaches that the millennium refers to the present reign of Christ with his saints in heaven.
   - Denies a future earthly golden age prior to the final judgment.
   - Sees the church’s suffering and triumph as concurrent realities until Christ’s return.
   - Interprets prophetic passages through the lens of **covenant theology**.
   - "The kingdom of Christ is spiritual, not carnal, and is now being realized in the church." (Institutes, 3.23.7)

3. **Unity of the Eschatological Consummation**
   - Holds that the second coming, resurrection, and judgment are a single complex event.
   - Rejects any chronological gap between these eschatological milestones.
   - Argues that Scripture presents the end as a unified consummation.
   - Opposes systems that fragment the end times into multiple stages.
   - "Scripture knows nothing of a twofold resurrection or a divided coming of Christ." (Institutes, 3.23.8)

4. **Hermeneutic: Literal and Figurative Distinctions**
   - Advocates careful distinction between literal and figurative language in prophecy.
   - Maintains that apocalyptic texts employ symbolic imagery.
   - Warns against wooden literalism, especially in Revelation.
   - Grounds interpretation in the analogy of faith and the broader context of redemptive history.
   - "Prophecies must be interpreted according to the nature of their genre and the analogy of faith." (Institutes, 3.23.9)

5. **Christ’s Kingdom is Spiritual**
   - Asserts that Christ’s reign is presently exercised from heaven, not on an earthly throne.
   - Denies that the church will possess temporal power or glory before the final state.
   - Emphasizes the already/not yet tension of the kingdom.
   - Connects the church’s hope to the final resurrection, not to a prior earthly millennium.
   - "The church’s glory is reserved for the world to come, not for a temporal kingdom before the end." (Institutes, 3.23.10)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s **amillennial** stance became a standard within the Reformed tradition, shaping later confessional documents and theological education. His careful exegesis and polemical clarity provided a robust defense against both **premillennialism** and speculative eschatologies. Turretin’s influence endures in Reformed seminaries and confessional statements, reinforcing a spiritual and unified vision of the end times. His approach to **millennial views** continues to inform contemporary Reformed eschatology.
