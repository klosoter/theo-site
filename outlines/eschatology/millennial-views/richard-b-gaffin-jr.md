# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose approach to **millennial views** is shaped by a robust commitment to **biblical theology** and the **already/not yet** structure of **eschatology**. Gaffin is a prominent advocate of **amillennialism**, emphasizing the present reality of Christ’s reign and the inaugurated fulfillment of the **kingdom of God** rather than a future earthly millennium.

- "The New Testament does not support the expectation of a future, earthly, thousand-year reign of Christ." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- "The Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology" (1978)
- "Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit" (1979)
- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation" (2006)
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1977)
- Contributions to "Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond" (ed. Darrell L. Bock, 1999)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennialism as the Reformed Position**
    - Argues that the **millennium** of Revelation 20 is symbolic of the present church age.
    - Rejects a literal, future thousand-year reign of Christ on earth.
    - Sees the binding of Satan and the reign of the saints as present realities.
    - Emphasizes continuity with classic **Reformed confessions**.
    "Amillennialism best accounts for the eschatological structure of the New Testament." (Theonomy and Eschatology)

2. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - Stresses the inaugurated nature of **Christ’s kingdom** at his first coming.
    - The fullness of the kingdom awaits Christ’s return, but its reality is present now.
    - The resurrection and new creation are begun but not consummated.
    - This framework shapes his critique of **premillennial** and **postmillennial** schemes.
    "The New Testament presents eschatology as both already fulfilled and not yet completed." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Critique of Premillennialism**
    - Argues that **premillennialism** misunderstands the nature of Christ’s return.
    - Rejects the idea of a two-stage return or a literal earthly millennium.
    - Emphasizes the finality and universality of the resurrection and judgment at Christ’s coming.
    - Sees no biblical warrant for a restored Jewish kingdom or temple.
    "The New Testament knows only one return of Christ, which brings consummation." (Theonomy and Eschatology)

4. **Rejection of Postmillennial Optimism**
    - Disputes the expectation of a golden age of Christian dominance before Christ’s return.
    - Emphasizes the ongoing presence of suffering and opposition in the church age.
    - Sees the church’s mission as witness, not triumphalism.
    - Warns against over-realized eschatology.
    "The New Testament does not promise a period of worldwide righteousness before the end." (Theonomy and Eschatology)

5. **Centrality of the Resurrection**
    - The **resurrection of Christ** is the decisive eschatological event.
    - Believers participate in resurrection life now, anticipating its consummation.
    - The resurrection marks the beginning of the **new creation**, not a future millennium.
    - This shapes his understanding of the timing and nature of eschatological hope.
    "The resurrection is the hinge of redemptive history and the guarantee of the age to come." (The Centrality of the Resurrection)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary **Reformed eschatology**, particularly in defending and articulating **amillennialism** within the Westminster tradition. His emphasis on the **already/not yet** dynamic has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, reinforcing a Christ-centered, redemptive-historical approach to the end times. Gaffin’s careful exegesis and theological clarity continue to serve as a standard reference for those engaging with millennial debates in the Reformed world.
