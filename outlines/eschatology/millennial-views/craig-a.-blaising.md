# Craig A. Blaising (1954–)

Craig A. Blaising is a leading advocate of **progressive dispensationalism**, offering a nuanced approach to **millennial views** within evangelical theology. He affirms a **premillennial** position, emphasizing the continuity of **God’s redemptive plan** across both Old and New Testaments, while distinguishing between **Israel and the Church** without rigid separation.

- "Progressive dispensationalism affirms the future, earthly reign of Christ, but sees the present age as an inaugurated phase of that kingdom." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

## Key Works

- Progressive Dispensationalism (with Darrell L. Bock)
- Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond (contributor)
- Dispensationalism, Israel and the Church: The Search for Definition (editor)
- "Premillennialism" in The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Progressive Dispensationalism Defined**
   - Argues for a mediating position between classic dispensationalism and covenant theology.
   - Sees **God’s kingdom** as both "already" and "not yet" in its fulfillment.
   - Emphasizes the unity of **God’s redemptive purposes** across history.
   - Maintains a future for **national Israel** within the millennial reign.
   - "The kingdom is present in Christ, but its fullness awaits his return." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

2. **Premillennialism Affirmed**
   - Teaches that Christ will return before a literal **millennial kingdom** on earth.
   - Views Revelation 20 as describing a future, physical reign of Christ.
   - Connects Old Testament promises to a coming age of restoration.
   - Distinguishes this view from **amillennial** and **postmillennial** interpretations.
   - "Premillennialism best accounts for the prophetic hope of both Testaments." (Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity**
   - Recognizes both continuity and discontinuity between **Israel and the Church**.
   - Rejects strict separation, but maintains distinct roles in God’s plan.
   - Sees the Church as participating in, but not replacing, Israel’s promises.
   - Argues for a future fulfillment of national promises to Israel.
   - "The church participates in the promises, but Israel’s identity is not lost." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

4. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
   - Affirms that aspects of the **kingdom** are inaugurated in Christ’s first coming.
   - The present age is a partial realization of eschatological hope.
   - The full manifestation of the kingdom awaits Christ’s return.
   - This view shapes a dynamic understanding of biblical prophecy.
   - "The kingdom is both present and future, inaugurated and consummated." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

5. **Hermeneutical Method**
   - Employs a **complementary hermeneutic** rather than a strictly literal or allegorical approach.
   - Allows New Testament revelation to expand, but not contradict, Old Testament promises.
   - Stresses the importance of historical-grammatical interpretation.
   - Seeks theological coherence across the canon.
   - "The complementary hermeneutic recognizes both continuity and progression in revelation." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Blaising’s articulation of **progressive dispensationalism** has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical discussions on **millennial views**. His work has provided a mediating path between traditional dispensationalism and covenantal approaches, influencing both academic and pastoral circles. By emphasizing inaugurated eschatology and a nuanced view of Israel and the Church, Blaising has contributed to a more integrated understanding of biblical prophecy and the doctrine of the kingdom. His scholarship continues to inform debates on eschatology and the interpretation of Scripture within the Reformed and evangelical traditions.
