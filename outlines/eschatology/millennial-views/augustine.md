# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine decisively shaped **Christian eschatology** by rejecting a literal **millennial reign** and developing what became known as **amillennialism**. He interpreted the **"thousand years"** of Revelation 20 as a symbolic period corresponding to the present **church age**, emphasizing the spiritual reign of Christ with his saints rather than an earthly, temporal kingdom.

- "The thousand years, therefore, may be understood in two ways, so far as occurs to me: either because these things happen in the sixth millennium, or because they are perfected in the sixth millennium." (City of God, XX.7)

## Key Works

- City of God (especially Books XX–XXII)
- Expositions on the Psalms
- Tractates on the Gospel of John
- Letters (Epistulae), especially those addressing eschatological questions
- Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia (ed. Allan D. Fitzgerald, for secondary reference)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Literal Millennialism**
   - Opposed the **Chiliasm** of some early Christians who expected a literal thousand-year reign.
   - Saw such expectations as carnal and inconsistent with the spiritual nature of Christ’s kingdom.
   - Emphasized the dangers of earthly hope overshadowing heavenly realities.
   - Interpreted Revelation 20 as symbolic rather than predictive of a future earthly era.
   - "But those who, on the strength of this passage, have suspected that the first resurrection is future and bodily, have been moved, among other things, especially by the number of a thousand years." (City of God, XX.7)

2. **Spiritual Interpretation of the Millennium**
   - Identified the "thousand years" with the current age of the **church**.
   - Taught that Christ reigns now through his saints, not in a future earthly kingdom.
   - Saw the binding of Satan as Christ’s victory in his first coming.
   - Understood the resurrection in Revelation 20 as spiritual regeneration, not bodily resurrection.
   - "Therefore the Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven." (City of God, XX.9)

3. **Two Resurrections: Spiritual and Bodily**
   - Distinguished between the present spiritual resurrection (regeneration) and the future bodily resurrection.
   - The "first resurrection" is the new birth of believers in this age.
   - The "second resurrection" is the final resurrection at Christ’s return.
   - This distinction undergirds his amillennial reading of Revelation 20.
   - "The first resurrection, then, is now, and is the resurrection of the soul." (City of God, XX.9)

4. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
   - Emphasized the **inaugurated** nature of Christ’s reign: already present, not yet consummated.
   - The church participates in Christ’s kingdom now, awaiting its full realization.
   - The defeat of evil is begun but not completed until the final judgment.
   - This framework shaped later **Reformed** and **catholic** eschatological thought.
   - "The Church, therefore, even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven." (City of God, XX.9)

5. **Christ’s Reign is Primarily Spiritual**
   - Christ’s kingdom is not of this world, but spiritual and heavenly.
   - The saints reign with Christ now through faith, hope, and love.
   - Earthly expectations of a political or material kingdom are misguided.
   - The ultimate hope is the **eternal city of God**, not an earthly millennium.
   - "He will come from heaven to judge the living and the dead, and thus will end the world, and the eternal kingdom of the saints will begin." (City of God, XX.30)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s **amillennial** interpretation became the dominant view in Western Christianity, profoundly shaping both medieval and Reformation eschatology. His spiritual reading of the millennium influenced the **Reformed tradition** and remains foundational for much of Protestant and Catholic theology. By rejecting a literal earthly reign, Augustine redirected Christian hope toward the **eternal city of God** and the consummation of all things in Christ. His approach continues to inform contemporary debates on the nature of the kingdom and the interpretation of apocalyptic texts.
