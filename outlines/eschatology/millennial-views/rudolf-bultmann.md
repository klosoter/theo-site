# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **millennial views** through his program of **demythologization**, arguing that New Testament eschatological language should be interpreted existentially rather than as predictions of literal future events. He rejected traditional **premillennial**, **postmillennial**, and **amillennial** frameworks, insisting that the true significance of eschatology lies in the individual's encounter with the **kerygma** and the call to authentic existence in the present. For Bultmann, the **kingdom of God** is not a future historical reality but a present existential possibility.

- "The expectation of the imminent end of the world is part of the world-picture of the New Testament and cannot be accepted by modern man." (Kerygma and Myth)

## Key Works

- "Kerygma and Myth" (1941, with later essays)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (essay in Kerygma and Myth)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948–1953)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Eschatology**
    - Interprets biblical eschatological language as mythological, not literal.
    - Seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind apocalyptic imagery.
    - Argues that modern people cannot accept a literal end-times scenario.
    - Focuses on the existential decision demanded by the proclamation.
    - "Mythological eschatology is only the outer wrapping of the existential call to decision." (Kerygma and Myth)

2. **Existential Interpretation of the Kingdom**
    - The **kingdom of God** is realized in the individual's present response to the gospel.
    - Rejects the notion of a future, historical millennium.
    - Emphasizes the present encounter with Christ as decisive.
    - Eschatology is about authentic existence, not chronology.
    - "Eschatology is not the end of history, but the end of the old existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Apocalyptic Literalism**
    - Denies the validity of reading New Testament apocalyptic texts as predictions.
    - Views apocalyptic language as symbolic of existential realities.
    - Critiques both conservative and liberal millennial schemes as missing the point.
    - Insists that faith is not about foreseeing future events.
    - "The apocalyptic world-view is not binding for Christian faith." (Kerygma and Myth)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation (kerygma) is the locus of eschatological significance.
    - Calls for a response of faith in the present moment.
    - The kerygma confronts the hearer with a decision, not information about the future.
    - The existential encounter with the kerygma is the true 'end' for the individual.
    - "The real meaning of eschatology is the summons to decision here and now." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Historical Skepticism about Eschatological Timetables**
    - Questions the historical reliability of New Testament eschatological expectations.
    - Argues that early Christian hopes for an imminent end were mistaken.
    - Maintains that Christian faith does not depend on the fulfillment of such hopes.
    - Focuses on the enduring existential message rather than failed predictions.
    - "The New Testament expectation of the imminent end has been proved false, but its existential meaning remains." (History and Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **millennial views** profoundly shaped modern theology by shifting the focus from literal eschatological expectations to existential interpretation. His method of **demythologization** influenced generations of scholars to reconsider the meaning of apocalyptic texts and the relevance of eschatology for contemporary faith. While controversial, his work remains a touchstone in debates over the interpretation of **New Testament eschatology** and the relationship between historical criticism and theological proclamation.
