# Kim Riddlebarger (1955– )

Kim Riddlebarger is a leading contemporary advocate of **amillennialism** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the symbolic interpretation of the **millennium** in Revelation 20. He argues that the **millennial reign** is presently realized in the reign of Christ and the church age, rejecting both **premillennialism** and **postmillennialism** as inconsistent with biblical teaching and historic Reformed confessions.

- "The millennium is not a future golden age, but the present reign of Christ with his saints between the two advents." 

## Key Works

- A Case for Amillennialism: Understanding the End Times (2003)
- The Man of Sin: Uncovering the Truth About the Antichrist (2006)
- "Amillennialism" in Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond (1999, ed. Darrell L. Bock)
- Contributions to Modern Reformation magazine
- Various lectures and sermons on eschatology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennialism as the Biblical Position**
    - The **millennium** of Revelation 20 is a symbolic description of the present church age.
    - Christ’s **second coming** will inaugurate the final judgment and the new creation, not a literal earthly millennium.
    - The binding of Satan refers to his restraint from deceiving the nations, not his total inactivity.
    - The resurrection described in Revelation 20 is spiritual (regeneration) and physical (final resurrection).
    - "Amillennialism best accounts for the biblical data and the structure of redemptive history." (A Case for Amillennialism)

2. **Rejection of Premillennialism**
    - Premillennialism divides the return of Christ into multiple stages, which lacks biblical support.
    - It often relies on a literalistic hermeneutic that ignores the genre of **apocalyptic literature**.
    - The idea of a restored Jewish kingdom undermines the unity of the **people of God**.
    - The New Testament consistently presents a single, climactic return of Christ.
    - "Premillennialism introduces unwarranted complexity into the biblical doctrine of the last things." (A Case for Amillennialism)

3. **Critique of Postmillennialism**
    - Postmillennialism’s optimism about a future golden age is not supported by the New Testament’s teaching on tribulation and suffering.
    - The church’s mission is faithfulness, not the establishment of a Christianized society before Christ’s return.
    - The parables of Jesus indicate a mixed response to the gospel until the end.
    - The final victory comes only with Christ’s return, not through gradual progress.
    - "The New Testament does not teach a gradual Christianization of the world prior to Christ’s return." (A Case for Amillennialism)

4. **Christ’s Present Reign**
    - Christ is currently reigning at the right hand of the Father, fulfilling **messianic prophecy**.
    - Believers participate in this reign through union with Christ.
    - The kingdom is “already/not yet”—present in part, consummated at the **parousia**.
    - The church’s life is marked by both victory and suffering until the end.
    - "The kingdom of God is present wherever Christ rules in the hearts of his people." (A Case for Amillennialism)

5. **Hermeneutics of Prophecy**
    - Prophetic passages must be interpreted in light of their genre and the **analogy of faith**.
    - Old Testament promises are fulfilled in Christ and the church, not in a future ethnic Israel.
    - Symbolic and typological readings are essential for understanding apocalyptic texts.
    - The unity of Scripture demands a Christ-centered approach to eschatology.
    - "The New Testament writers consistently interpret Old Testament prophecy in light of Christ’s first and second comings." (Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond)

## Legacy and Impact

Riddlebarger has played a significant role in the modern resurgence of **amillennialism** within Reformed and evangelical circles. His clear exposition and defense of the amillennial position have influenced pastors, scholars, and laypeople, especially through his widely used book and public teaching. By engaging with competing millennial views and emphasizing a redemptive-historical approach, he has helped shape contemporary discussions on **eschatology** and the interpretation of prophetic Scripture.
