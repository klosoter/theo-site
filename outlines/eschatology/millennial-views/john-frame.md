# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **millennial views** with characteristic humility and a commitment to **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the diversity of orthodox positions within the church. He affirms the centrality of **Christ’s return**, the reality of a future **bodily resurrection**, and the ultimate victory of God’s kingdom, while remaining non-dogmatic about the specifics of **premillennialism**, **amillennialism**, or **postmillennialism**.

- "I do not believe that Scripture gives us enough information to decide definitively among the millennial views." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2013)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- Eschatology notes and lectures (various, Westminster Theological Seminary and Reformed Theological Seminary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Humility**
    - Frame insists that **Scripture** does not provide exhaustive detail on the millennium.
    - He encourages charity and unity among Christians holding different **millennial positions**.
    - Emphasizes the **perspectival** nature of theological interpretation.
    - Warns against dogmatism in secondary eschatological matters.
    - "We should not divide the church over the millennium." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Centrality of Christ’s Return**
    - Affirms the visible, bodily, and glorious **second coming of Christ** as the climax of history.
    - Teaches that all millennial views agree on the certainty of Christ’s return.
    - Frames the millennium as subordinate to the hope of Christ’s appearing.
    - Stresses the importance of living in light of Christ’s imminent return.
    - "The most important thing is that Jesus is coming again." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Affirmation of Orthodox Diversity**
    - Recognizes **premillennialism**, **amillennialism**, and **postmillennialism** as legitimate within Reformed orthodoxy.
    - Argues that each view has biblical and theological strengths and weaknesses.
    - Urges that confessional standards allow for diversity on this issue.
    - Sees the millennium as a secondary, not primary, doctrinal matter.
    - "There are good arguments for each of the major millennial positions." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Kingdom Already/Not Yet**
    - Emphasizes the **inaugurated eschatology**: the kingdom is already present but not yet consummated.
    - The millennium, however understood, must fit within this biblical tension.
    - Warns against over-realized or under-realized eschatology.
    - Connects the millennium to the broader biblical narrative of redemption.
    - "The kingdom is both present and future, already and not yet." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Priority of Redemptive History**
    - Frames millennial debates within the larger context of **redemptive history**.
    - Sees the millennium as one aspect of God’s unfolding plan, not the center.
    - Encourages focus on the certainty of final judgment and new creation.
    - Stresses the unity of God’s purpose from creation to consummation.
    - "The millennium is not the main point of biblical eschatology." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s approach to **millennial views** has encouraged a spirit of humility and unity within the Reformed tradition, prioritizing the essentials of **Christ’s return** and the consummation of God’s kingdom. His perspectival method and emphasis on the already/not yet shape contemporary discussions of eschatology, urging students and pastors to hold secondary matters with open hands. Frame’s influence is especially felt in Reformed seminaries, where his balanced and charitable treatment of millennial debates continues to guide theological education.
