# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s stance on **millennial views** is best described as **amillennial**, rejecting a literal thousand-year earthly reign of Christ. He interprets **Revelation 20** symbolically, emphasizing the present spiritual reign of Christ and the unity of the **church** throughout redemptive history, rather than a future **millennial kingdom** on earth.

- "But a little later there followed the millenarians, who limited the reign of Christ to a thousand years. Their fiction is too childish either to need or to deserve refutation." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 3.25.5)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 3, Chapter 25)
- Commentary on Revelation
- Commentary on Daniel
- Sermons on 2 Thessalonians
- Calvin: Commentaries (ed. Joseph Haroutunian, for selections on eschatology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennial Interpretation of Revelation 20**
    - Rejects a literal thousand-year reign of Christ on earth.
    - Sees the "first resurrection" as spiritual, referring to regeneration or the intermediate state.
    - Interprets the binding of Satan as Christ’s victory at his first coming.
    - Views the millennium as symbolic of the church age.
    - "Those who assign the children of God a thousand years in which to enjoy the inheritance of the world, do not realize what it means to be raised up to heaven." (Institutes, 3.25.5)

2. **Unity of the Covenant People**
    - Emphasizes the continuity of the **church** as the people of God across both Testaments.
    - Rejects a future, separate Jewish millennium.
    - Sees all believers as heirs of the same promises in Christ.
    - Argues that the Old Testament prophecies are fulfilled spiritually in the church.
    - "It is a perverse interpretation which extends what is said of the blessedness of the next life to the present enjoyment of earthly things." (Institutes, 3.25.4)

3. **Christ’s Present Reign**
    - Affirms that Christ currently reigns at the right hand of the Father.
    - The kingdom of Christ is spiritual, not earthly or political.
    - Believers participate in Christ’s reign through union with him.
    - The church’s mission is to proclaim the gospel, not to establish a political kingdom.
    - "The kingdom of Christ is spiritual, because it raises our hearts to hope for the blessedness which is not seen." (Institutes, 3.25.6)

4. **Eschatological Hope Focused on Consummation**
    - The ultimate hope is the **new heavens and new earth**, not a temporary earthly millennium.
    - The resurrection and final judgment occur at Christ’s return.
    - No intermediate earthly kingdom is expected between Christ’s return and the eternal state.
    - The focus is on the consummation of all things in Christ.
    - "Scripture uniformly enjoins us to look forward with expectation to Christ’s coming, and to hold all the blessings promised us in hope." (Institutes, 3.25.3)

5. **Rejection of Millenarianism**
    - Explicitly opposes **chiliasm** (millenarianism) as speculative and unfounded.
    - Critiques those who expect a literal, earthly reign of Christ.
    - Warns against distracting the church with speculative end-times schemes.
    - Emphasizes sober, Christ-centered eschatology.
    - "Let us not be ashamed to be ignorant in matters which God has been pleased to keep secret." (Commentary on Revelation 20:4)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s **amillennial** approach became foundational for the Reformed tradition, shaping later confessional statements and commentaries. His symbolic reading of **Revelation 20** influenced generations of Protestant interpreters and helped establish a Christ-centered, redemptive-historical approach to eschatology. Calvin’s rejection of **chiliasm** set a precedent for much of Reformed orthodoxy, and his focus on the unity of the church and the spiritual nature of Christ’s kingdom continues to inform contemporary Reformed theology.
