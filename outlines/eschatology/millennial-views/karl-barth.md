# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth rejected literal interpretations of the **millennium** in Revelation 20, insisting that all **eschatological hope** is grounded in the **centrality of Christ** and the **sovereignty of God**. He refused to align with traditional **premillennialism**, **postmillennialism**, or **amillennialism**, emphasizing the **already/not yet** character of the kingdom and locating the meaning of history in Christ’s person and work rather than speculative timelines.

- "The New Testament knows nothing of a thousand-year earthly kingdom of Christ and His saints." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics IV/3: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics III/2: The Doctrine of Creation
- Dogmatics in Outline
- The Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - All **eschatological hope** is centered on the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - The resurrection is the decisive event for understanding the future.
    - Christ’s lordship, not speculative timelines, is the focus of Christian hope.
    - The meaning of history is revealed in Christ, not in future earthly kingdoms.
    "Eschatology is Christology, and Christology is eschatology." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

2. **Rejection of Literal Millennium**
    - Revelation 20 is interpreted symbolically, not as a literal thousand-year reign.
    - Millennial expectations are seen as distractions from the gospel’s central message.
    - The millennium is a sign of the victory already accomplished in Christ.
    - Barth warns against constructing detailed future scenarios from apocalyptic texts.
    "The thousand years in Revelation are not a chronological period but a symbol of Christ’s victory." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

3. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - Emphasizes the tension between the **inaugurated** and **consummated** kingdom.
    - Believers live between Christ’s resurrection and His return.
    - The fullness of God’s reign is both present and still awaited.
    - Christian hope is grounded in what God has already done and what He will finally do.
    "We live between the times, in the light of what has happened and what is to come." (Dogmatics in Outline)

4. **Sovereignty of God in History**
    - God’s purposes in history are not bound by human schemes or expectations.
    - The future is determined by God’s free and sovereign action.
    - Human history finds its meaning in God’s revelation, not in millennial calculations.
    - Barth resists all forms of historicism or human progressivism in eschatology.
    "God is the Lord of history, and His kingdom comes as He wills." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

5. **Critique of Apocalyptic Speculation**
    - Barth is critical of attempts to predict the end times or establish earthly utopias.
    - Apocalyptic speculation is seen as a diversion from faith in Christ.
    - The church’s task is witness, not calculation of prophetic timetables.
    - True hope is rooted in God’s promise, not in human knowledge of the future.
    "The Christian does not know the day or the hour, but trusts in the promise." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s approach to **millennial views** has significantly shaped modern **Reformed eschatology**, steering theologians away from literalist or speculative frameworks. His insistence on the **centrality of Christ** and the **already/not yet** dynamic continues to influence both academic and pastoral theology. Barth’s legacy endures in his call to ground Christian hope in the sovereignty and revelation of God, rather than in detailed eschatological systems.
