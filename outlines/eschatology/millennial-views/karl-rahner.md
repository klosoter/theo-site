# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached **millennial views** within the broader context of **eschatology**, emphasizing the existential and Christocentric dimensions of Christian hope rather than detailed prophetic schemes. He critiqued literalist readings of the **millennium** and instead focused on the **already/not yet** tension of the **Kingdom of God**, integrating eschatological fulfillment with the ongoing reality of grace in history.

- "The Christian does not await a thousand-year reign, but the definitive coming of the Lord." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)

3. **Already/Not Yet Kingdom**
    - Emphasizes the **inaugurated eschatology**: the Kingdom is present but not fully realized.
    - Sees Christian life as participation in the tension between present grace and future glory.
    - Rejects any notion of a purely future or purely present kingdom.

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s approach to **millennial views** has shaped modern Catholic and ecumenical eschatology by emphasizing the **already/not yet** dynamic and the centrality of Christ. His rejection of literal millennialism influenced post-Vatican II theology and contributed to a more existential and pastoral understanding of Christian hope. Rahner’s synthesis of **eschatology** with anthropology and Christology continues to inform contemporary discussions on the meaning of the **Kingdom of God** and the ultimate destiny of creation.
