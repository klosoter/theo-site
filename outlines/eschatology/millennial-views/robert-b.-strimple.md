# Robert B. Strimple (1932–)

Robert B. Strimple is a prominent advocate of **amillennialism** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the present, spiritual reign of Christ rather than a literal, future **millennial kingdom** on earth. His approach to **eschatology** is marked by a strong commitment to **redemptive-historical interpretation** and the unity of **covenant theology**, rejecting both **premillennialism** and **postmillennialism** as inconsistent with the New Testament witness.

- "The amillennialist believes that the millennium described in Revelation 20 is a symbolic description of the present reign of Christ with his saints." (Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond)

## Key Works

- "Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond" (contributor)
- "The Modern Search for the Real Jesus" (sections on eschatology)
- "The Case for Amillennialism" (various published essays and lectures)
- "Systematic Theology" (lectures and unpublished class materials at Westminster Seminary California)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennialism as Biblical Eschatology**
    - Interprets **Revelation 20** symbolically, not as a literal thousand-year reign.
    - Sees the **millennium** as the current church age, inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection.
    - Emphasizes the already/not yet tension of the **kingdom of God**.
    - Rejects the expectation of a future, earthly reign of Christ prior to the final judgment.
    "The millennium is now, not a future golden age on earth." (Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond)

2. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Views the Old and New Testaments as a unified story of **covenant fulfillment**.
    - Argues that Old Testament promises are fulfilled in Christ and his church.
    - Denies a future, separate destiny for ethnic Israel apart from the church.
    - Sees the church as the true inheritor of the promises to Abraham.
    "The New Testament teaches that all the promises of God find their Yes in Christ." (Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond)

3. **Hermeneutic of Symbolic Interpretation**
    - Advocates for a **redemptive-historical** and symbolic reading of apocalyptic texts.
    - Interprets numbers and images in Revelation as figurative.
    - Warns against literalism that distorts the genre and message of biblical prophecy.
    - Prioritizes clear New Testament teaching over obscure prophetic passages.
    "We must interpret the obscure in light of the clear, not vice versa." (Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond)

4. **Rejection of Premillennialism and Postmillennialism**
    - Critiques **premillennialism** for dividing the return of Christ into multiple stages.
    - Argues that **postmillennialism** overestimates the progress of the church in history.
    - Maintains that both views misunderstand the nature of the **kingdom of God**.
    - Emphasizes the church’s suffering and witness in the present age.
    "Neither premillennialism nor postmillennialism does justice to the New Testament’s teaching on suffering and glory." (Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond)

5. **Consummation at Christ’s Return**
    - Teaches that the **resurrection**, **final judgment**, and **new creation** occur at Christ’s second coming.
    - Denies a gap between Christ’s return and the final state.
    - Affirms the immediacy and finality of the **parousia**.
    - Sees the hope of believers as focused on the new heavens and new earth, not a temporary earthly kingdom.
    "The blessed hope is not a millennial kingdom, but the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior." (Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond)

## Legacy and Impact

Strimple’s defense of **amillennialism** has shaped contemporary Reformed eschatological thought, especially through his clear articulation in both popular and academic forums. His work has provided a robust, covenantal alternative to dispensational and postmillennial schemes, influencing pastors, students, and theologians within the Westminster tradition and beyond. By emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of Christ’s present reign, Strimple has helped anchor Reformed eschatology in biblical theology rather than speculative chronology.
