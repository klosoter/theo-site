# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—do not explicitly endorse a particular **millennial view** such as **amillennialism**, **premillennialism**, or **postmillennialism**. However, their eschatological formulations emphasize the **second coming of Christ**, the **final judgment**, and the **consummation of all things**, reflecting a historic Reformed caution toward speculative millennial schemes. The confessions focus on the certainty of Christ’s return and the hope of the **resurrection**, rather than on a literal earthly millennium.

- "We believe, according to the Word of God, that when the time appointed by the Lord (which is unknown to all creatures) is come, and the number of the elect complete, our Lord Jesus Christ will come from heaven, corporally and visibly, as He ascended, with great glory and majesty..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Article 37: "The Last Judgment"
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Day 22 (Q&A 57–58)
- Canons of Dort, Fifth Head of Doctrine, Article 15
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- The Reformation of the Eschaton (Kim Riddlebarger, secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Return Is Singular and Final**
    - Affirms a single, visible, glorious **second coming** of Christ.
    - Rejects any notion of multiple returns or secret raptures.
    - Links Christ’s return directly with the **final judgment** and resurrection.
    - Emphasizes the unpredictability of the timing.
    - "Our Lord Jesus Christ will come from heaven, corporally and visibly, as He ascended, with great glory and majesty..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

2. **Resurrection and Judgment Are Universal**
    - All the dead will be raised, both righteous and wicked.
    - The final judgment will immediately follow the resurrection.
    - No intermediate earthly reign is specified between resurrection and judgment.
    - The eternal state is inaugurated after judgment.
    - "All men will appear personally before this great Judge... to give an account of every idle word they have spoken..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

3. **Caution Against Millennial Speculation**
    - The confessions avoid detailed millennial chronology.
    - Focus is on the certainty, not the sequence, of end-time events.
    - Warns against curiosity and speculation about the times and seasons.
    - The hope of believers is grounded in Christ’s promise, not in earthly expectations.
    - "Therefore we reject all human inventions, and all laws which man would introduce into the worship of God..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

4. **Eternal State Follows Judgment**
    - The righteous will inherit eternal life in the new heavens and new earth.
    - The wicked will be consigned to eternal condemnation.
    - No mention of a temporary, earthly millennium after Christ’s return.
    - The focus is on the everlasting communion with God.
    - "The faithful and elect shall be crowned with glory and honor; and the Son of God will confess their names before God His Father..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

5. **Hope Centered on Christ, Not Earthly Kingdom**
    - The believer’s hope is in union with Christ and eternal life.
    - Earthly prosperity or a golden age is not the focus of eschatological hope.
    - The confessions direct attention to spiritual realities and the world to come.
    - The church’s mission is to persevere in faith until Christ returns.
    - "I believe that, after this life, I shall inherit perfect salvation, which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man..." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 58)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have shaped the eschatological outlook of the continental Reformed tradition, fostering a cautious, **amillennial**-leaning approach that prioritizes the certainty of Christ’s return and the final judgment over speculative millennial schemes. Their restraint on millennial details has contributed to unity within Reformed churches and provided a theological anchor against apocalyptic excesses. These confessions continue to guide Reformed communities in maintaining a Christ-centered, hope-filled eschatology.
