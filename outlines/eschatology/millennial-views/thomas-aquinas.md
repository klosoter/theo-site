# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached **millennial views** within the broader context of **eschatology**, emphasizing the ultimate fulfillment of history in the **beatific vision** rather than a literal earthly millennium. He rejected **chiliasm** (the belief in a literal thousand-year reign of Christ on earth) as inconsistent with the spiritual nature of the **kingdom of God**, favoring an **amillennial** interpretation rooted in the teachings of Augustine and the tradition of the Western Church.

- "The kingdom of the saints is not to be looked for in this world, but in the world to come." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q77, A1, ad 4)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially Supplement, Questions 77–99
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard (Book IV, Distinction 48)
- De Malo (On Evil), Question 5
- Compendium Theologiae, Chapters 167–173
- Selected passages in Catena Aurea (commentary on Revelation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Literal Millennium**
   - Denies a literal thousand-year reign of Christ on earth after His Second Coming.
   - Views **chiliasm** as a misreading of **Revelation 20** and contrary to apostolic tradition.
   - Argues that the promises of the kingdom are fulfilled spiritually, not temporally.
   - Emphasizes the dangers of materialistic interpretations of eschatology.
   - "Augustine says that the opinion of some, who believed that the saints would reign bodily on earth for a thousand years, is to be rejected." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q77, A1, ad 4)

2. **Primacy of the Beatific Vision**
   - The ultimate end of humanity is union with God in the **beatific vision**, not an earthly reign.
   - The resurrection and final judgment usher believers into eternal life, not a temporal kingdom.
   - Earthly blessings are types and shadows of the heavenly reality.
   - The fullness of the kingdom is realized only in the **consummation** of all things.
   - "The reward of the saints is not temporal but eternal blessedness." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q91, A1)

3. **Spiritual Nature of the Kingdom**
   - The **kingdom of God** is primarily spiritual, present in the Church and perfected in eternity.
   - Christ’s reign is exercised through His Church and in the souls of the faithful.
   - The Church militant anticipates the Church triumphant, not an intermediate earthly phase.
   - The reign of Christ is not interrupted or delayed by a future millennium.
   - "The reign of the saints is to be understood spiritually, not carnally." (Commentary on the Sentences IV, Dist. 48, Q1, A1)

4. **Reliance on Augustinian Tradition**
   - Follows Augustine’s **amillennial** interpretation of Revelation 20.
   - Sees the "thousand years" as symbolic of the present age of the Church.
   - Rejects Jewish and early Christian literalist readings as theologically deficient.
   - Emphasizes continuity with the Western theological tradition.
   - "Augustine’s explanation is more in accord with the authority of the Church." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q77, A1, ad 4)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment in Resurrection and Judgment**
   - The **resurrection of the dead** and **final judgment** are the decisive events of eschatology.
   - No intermediate earthly kingdom separates Christ’s return from the eternal state.
   - The righteous immediately enter into their reward; the wicked into punishment.
   - The consummation of history is marked by the restoration of all things in Christ.
   - "After the resurrection, there will be no further time for merit or demerit, but only for receiving reward or punishment." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q99, A2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s **amillennial** stance shaped the mainstream eschatology of the Western Church, reinforcing the spiritual interpretation of the **kingdom of God** and the centrality of the **beatific vision**. His rejection of chiliasm became normative in Roman Catholic theology and influenced later Reformed and Protestant traditions. Aquinas’s synthesis of biblical exegesis and patristic authority provided a durable framework for understanding Christian hope, emphasizing the ultimate fulfillment of all things in the resurrection and eternal life.
