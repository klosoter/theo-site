# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema was a prominent Reformed theologian known for his robust defense of **amillennialism** within the broader discussion of **millennial views**. He critiqued both **premillennialism** and **postmillennialism**, emphasizing the already/not yet nature of the **kingdom of God** and the centrality of **eschatological fulfillment** in Christ.

- "The kingdom of God is both a present reality and a future hope." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Key Works

- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- "Amillennialism" in The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views (1977)
- Created in God's Image (1986) [for broader theological context]
- Saved by Grace (1989) [for soteriological implications]

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennialism as Biblical Eschatology**
    - The **millennium** is symbolic of the present church age, not a literal thousand-year reign.
    - Christ's **second coming** will inaugurate the final judgment and the new creation.
    - Rejects a future, earthly reign of Christ before the eternal state.
    - Sees the **binding of Satan** as a present reality during the church age.
    - "The millennium of Revelation 20 is the period between Christ’s first and second comings." ("The Bible and the Future")

2. **Critique of Premillennialism**
    - Argues that premillennialism undermines the unity of the **people of God**.
    - Rejects the notion of a restored Jewish kingdom distinct from the church.
    - Emphasizes the finality of Christ’s return, not a two-stage parousia.
    - Sees the resurrection and judgment as single, climactic events.
    - "Premillennialism fails to do justice to the New Testament teaching about the unity of the church." ("The Bible and the Future")

3. **Already/Not Yet Kingdom**
    - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - Believers now experience spiritual blessings, awaiting full realization.
    - The church is the primary manifestation of the kingdom in this age.
    - Final victory over evil awaits Christ’s return.
    - "The kingdom is present wherever God’s will is done, but its final form is still future." ("The Bible and the Future")

4. **Rejection of Postmillennialism**
    - Disagrees with the expectation of a golden age of Christian dominance before Christ’s return.
    - Interprets biblical prophecies of triumph as referring to the new creation, not history.
    - Stresses ongoing conflict between the church and the world until the end.
    - Warns against over-optimism regarding human progress.
    - "Scripture does not teach a gradual Christianization of the world before Christ returns." ("The Bible and the Future")

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment in Christ**
    - All Old Testament promises are fulfilled in **Christ** and his people.
    - The new heavens and new earth are the ultimate hope for believers.
    - The resurrection is both spiritual (now) and physical (future).
    - The church lives in anticipation of the consummation of all things.
    - "All the promises of God find their Yes in Christ." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of **amillennialism** has become a standard reference in Reformed eschatology, shaping both academic and pastoral discussions. His clear critique of alternative millennial views and emphasis on the **already/not yet** dynamic have influenced generations of theologians and pastors. Hoekema’s work continues to provide a biblically grounded, theologically coherent framework for understanding the end times within the Reformed tradition.
