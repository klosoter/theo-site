# Sam Storms (1951– )

Sam Storms is a leading advocate of **amillennialism** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the present, spiritual reign of Christ rather than a future, earthly **millennial kingdom**. He critiques **premillennial** and **postmillennial** interpretations, arguing that the **book of Revelation** and other prophetic texts are best understood through a **redemptive-historical** and **inaugurated eschatology** lens.

- "The millennium is the present reign of the souls of deceased believers with Christ in heaven during the intermediate state." ("Kingdom Come")

## Key Works

- Kingdom Come: The Amillennial Alternative
- The Beginner’s Guide to Spiritual Warfare
- The Hope of Glory: 100 Daily Meditations on Colossians
- Tough Topics: Biblical Answers to 25 Challenging Questions
- A Case for Amillennialism (various articles and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennialism as Biblical Eschatology**
    - The **millennium** is symbolic of the current church age, not a literal future thousand-year reign.
    - Christ’s **kingdom** is present and spiritual, inaugurated at His resurrection and ascension.
    - The binding of Satan in Revelation 20 refers to his restriction from deceiving the nations during the gospel age.
    - The **resurrection** and final judgment occur simultaneously at Christ’s return.
    - "Amillennialism asserts that the millennium is now, coinciding with the inter-advent age." (Kingdom Come)

2. **Critique of Premillennialism**
    - Premillennialism’s literal reading of Revelation 20 is unwarranted.
    - The expectation of a future, earthly reign undermines the sufficiency of Christ’s current reign.
    - Old Testament prophecies are fulfilled in Christ and the church, not in a future national Israel.
    - The two-resurrection scheme is not supported by the broader canonical context.
    - "There is no compelling exegetical reason to separate the resurrection of believers and unbelievers by a thousand years." (Kingdom Come)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
    - Prophetic texts must be interpreted in light of the **New Testament** fulfillment in Christ.
    - The church is the true Israel, inheriting the promises made to Abraham.
    - Apocalyptic language is often symbolic, not literal.
    - The focus is on the consummation of redemption, not a return to Old Covenant forms.
    - "All the promises of God find their Yes in Jesus Christ, not in a future millennial age." (Kingdom Come)

4. **Inaugurated Eschatology**
    - The **kingdom of God** is already inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - Believers participate now in the reign of Christ through union with Him.
    - The defeat of Satan and the renewal of creation are both present realities and future hopes.
    - The church’s mission is shaped by the tension of the already and the not yet.
    - "We live between the times, experiencing the blessings of the age to come even as we await its fullness." (Kingdom Come)

5. **Pastoral Implications of Millennial Views**
    - Eschatology shapes Christian hope and perseverance amid suffering.
    - Overemphasis on speculative prophecy distracts from gospel mission.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ’s finished work and present reign.
    - The unity of the church is prioritized over divisive end-times debates.
    - "Our hope is not in a future earthly kingdom, but in the return of Christ and the new creation." (Kingdom Come)

## Legacy and Impact

Sam Storms has significantly influenced contemporary **amillennial** thought, especially among Reformed and evangelical audiences seeking clarity on **eschatology**. His accessible writings and lectures have helped popularize a redemptive-historical approach to prophetic texts. By emphasizing the present reality of Christ’s reign and the unity of the church, Storms has contributed to a renewed focus on gospel-centered hope rather than speculative end-times schemes.
