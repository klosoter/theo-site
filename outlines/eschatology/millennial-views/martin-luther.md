# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther rejected **chiliasm** (millenarianism) and did not develop a detailed **millennial view**. He interpreted the **Book of Revelation** and related prophetic passages primarily in a **historicist** and **Christocentric** manner, emphasizing the present reality of Christ’s reign rather than a future earthly millennium. For Luther, the focus was on the **consummation** at Christ’s return, not on speculative timelines.

- "Therefore we conclude, like all the fathers, that the saints are not to expect a temporal kingdom on earth." ("Lectures on Daniel")

## Key Works

- Lectures on Daniel
- Preface to the Revelation of St. John (in Luther’s German Bible)
- Sermons on Matthew 24
- Table Talk (Tischreden)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 35: Word and Sacrament I

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Chiliasm**
    - Denied a literal **thousand-year earthly reign** of Christ.
    - Associated millenarianism with **Jewish and heretical errors**.
    - Emphasized the **spiritual nature** of Christ’s kingdom.
    - Saw millennial speculation as a distraction from the gospel.
    - "I think that, as all the fathers, so we should also conclude that the saints are not to expect a temporal kingdom on earth." (Lectures on Daniel)

2. **Historicist Interpretation of Revelation**
    - Viewed **Revelation** as depicting the ongoing struggle of the church.
    - Identified the **papacy** with apocalyptic evil.
    - Rejected a strictly **futurist** or **preterist** reading.
    - Saw prophetic fulfillment throughout church history.
    - "The papacy is none other than the kingdom of Babylon and of the very Antichrist." (Preface to Revelation)

3. **Christocentric Eschatology**
    - Centered all prophecy on **Christ’s person and work**.
    - Downplayed speculative chronology in favor of **faith in Christ’s return**.
    - Emphasized the **already/not yet** tension of the kingdom.
    - Interpreted end-times hope as union with Christ, not earthly rule.
    - "Let us not be concerned with times and seasons, but look for Christ’s coming." (Sermons on Matthew 24)

4. **Imminence of Christ’s Return**
    - Taught that **Christ could return at any time**.
    - Warned against setting dates or constructing timetables.
    - Urged readiness and **watchfulness** among believers.
    - Linked the end with the defeat of the **Antichrist**.
    - "We should always be ready, for we know neither the day nor the hour." (Table Talk)

5. **Consummation, Not Earthly Kingdom**
    - Saw the **final judgment** as the true hope of believers.
    - Rejected the idea of a restored **Jewish kingdom** or golden age.
    - Affirmed the **resurrection of the dead** and new creation.
    - Focused on the eternal reign of God, not a temporal millennium.
    - "Our hope is not in an earthly kingdom, but in the resurrection and life everlasting." (Preface to Revelation)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s rejection of **millennialism** shaped the eschatology of the Lutheran tradition and influenced later **Reformed** and Protestant thought. His historicist approach to prophecy, especially his identification of the papacy with the Antichrist, became a hallmark of post-Reformation polemics. By emphasizing the **consummation** rather than speculative chronology, Luther redirected eschatological focus toward Christ’s return and the final judgment. His views continue to inform confessional Lutheran and broader Protestant understandings of the millennium.
