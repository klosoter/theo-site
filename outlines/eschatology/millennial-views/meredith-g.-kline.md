# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline advanced a distinctive **amillennial** perspective rooted in his robust **biblical-theological** method and covenantal framework. He emphasized the **already/not yet** structure of **eschatology**, interpreting the **millennium** of Revelation 20 as a symbolic depiction of the present church age, rather than a literal future era. Kline’s approach integrates **kingdom** and **consummation** themes, highlighting the typological fulfillment of Old Testament promises in Christ.

- "The millennium is the interadventual age, the period between the two comings of Christ." ("The Structure of Biblical Authority")

## Key Works

- "Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview"
- "The Structure of Biblical Authority"
- "Images of the Spirit"
- "By Oath Consigned"
- "God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Amillennialism as Biblical Eschatology**
    - Interprets the **millennium** as the present reign of Christ from heaven, not a future earthly kingdom.
    - Sees Revelation 20 as symbolic, not chronological, within the book’s apocalyptic genre.
    - Emphasizes the church’s current participation in Christ’s kingdom through union with Him.
    - Rejects both **premillennial** and **postmillennial** schemes as inconsistent with redemptive history.
    - "The millennial reign is the present reign of the saints with Christ in heaven." ("God, Heaven and Har Magedon")

2. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - Stresses the inaugurated nature of the **kingdom of God** in Christ’s first coming.
    - The fullness of the kingdom awaits the **consummation** at Christ’s return.
    - Old Testament promises are typologically fulfilled in the church, not postponed to a future age.
    - The tension between present reality and future hope shapes Christian life and mission.
    - "The kingdom is present in mystery, to be revealed in glory at the end." ("Kingdom Prologue")

3. **Covenantal Structure of Redemptive History**
    - Interprets eschatology through the lens of **covenant theology**.
    - The new covenant in Christ fulfills and transcends previous covenantal administrations.
    - The church is the true Israel, inheriting the promises through union with Christ.
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in the certainty of God’s covenant oath.
    - "The new covenant community is the heir of the eschatological promises." ("By Oath Consigned")

4. **Typology and Symbolism in Prophecy**
    - Advocates a typological reading of prophetic and apocalyptic texts.
    - Sees Old Testament land and temple imagery as fulfilled in Christ and the church.
    - The millennium is a symbol of the church age, not a literal thousand-year period.
    - Prophetic visions point to ultimate realities, not intermediate historical stages.
    - "Typology is the key to understanding the prophetic vision of the end." ("Images of the Spirit")

5. **Heavenly Focus of Eschatological Hope**
    - Emphasizes the **heavenly** rather than earthly character of the believer’s inheritance.
    - The ultimate hope is the new heavens and new earth, not a restored geopolitical Israel.
    - The church’s citizenship is in heaven, awaiting the final resurrection and judgment.
    - Earthly institutions are provisional, pointing to the eternal kingdom.
    - "Our hope is not in an earthly millennium but in the heavenly city to come." ("God, Heaven and Har Magedon")

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s **amillennial** interpretation has profoundly influenced Reformed biblical theology, especially in its integration of **covenant** and **eschatology**. His typological and redemptive-historical approach has shaped generations of scholars and pastors, particularly within Westminster and broader confessional circles. Kline’s work continues to provide a robust alternative to dispensational and theonomic millennial schemes, emphasizing the centrality of Christ and the church in the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan.
