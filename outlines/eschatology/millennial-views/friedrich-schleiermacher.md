# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached **millennial views** not through traditional eschatological speculation but by reinterpreting **Christian hope** and **eschatology** in terms of the development of **religious consciousness** and the progress of the **kingdom of God** within history. He downplayed literal interpretations of the **millennium**, instead emphasizing the ethical and communal transformation of humanity as the true fulfillment of eschatological expectation.

- "The kingdom of God is not a future state, but a present reality growing in the midst of the world." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **millennial views** shifted the focus of modern theology from speculative eschatology to the ethical and communal dimensions of Christian hope. His influence paved the way for later liberal and existential approaches to **eschatology**, emphasizing the present reality of the **kingdom of God**. While often criticized by confessional traditions, his thought remains foundational for understanding the development of modern Protestant theology and its approach to the future.
