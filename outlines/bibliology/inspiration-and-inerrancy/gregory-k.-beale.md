# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale is a leading contemporary Reformed scholar who has articulated a robust doctrine of **biblical inspiration** and **inerrancy** grounded in both the **self-witness of Scripture** and its use within the **New Testament**. Beale emphasizes that the **authority** and **truthfulness** of the Bible are rooted in its divine origin, and he defends a nuanced, historically-aware understanding of **inerrancy** that accounts for genre and authorial intent.

- "The New Testament authors consistently view the Old Testament as the very word of God, fully authoritative and without error." (The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism)

## Key Works

- The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism (2008)
- Handbook on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament (2012)
- "Did Jesus and His Followers Preach the Right Doctrine from the Wrong Texts?" in The Right Doctrine from the Wrong Texts? (1994)
- Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament (co-edited with D.A. Carson, 2007)
- "The Self-Attestation of Scripture" in Inerrancy and Hermeneutic (1988)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Divine Origin**
    - Scripture is the product of **divine inspiration**, not merely human reflection.
    - The Holy Spirit superintended the biblical authors, ensuring the communication of God’s intended message.
    - The authority of Scripture is grounded in its source: God Himself.
    - The self-witness of both Old and New Testaments affirms this divine origin.
    - "Scripture is God’s speech, mediated through human authors, and thus carries his authority." (The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism)

2. **Inerrancy Defined by Authorial Intent**
    - Inerrancy must be understood in light of the **intentions** and **genres** of the biblical authors.
    - Apparent discrepancies are often resolved by considering ancient literary conventions.
    - Inerrancy does not require modern standards of precision or reporting.
    - The truthfulness of Scripture is compatible with diverse literary forms.
    - "Inerrancy is not a claim that the Bible conforms to modern expectations, but that it is wholly true in what it intends to affirm." (The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism)

3. **Christ and the Apostles’ View of Scripture**
    - Jesus and the apostles consistently treat the Old Testament as **authoritative** and **without error**.
    - New Testament citations of the Old Testament presuppose its reliability.
    - The pattern of appeal to Scripture in the New Testament demonstrates its normative status.
    - The doctrine of inspiration is derived from the teaching and practice of Christ and his followers.
    - "The New Testament writers’ use of the Old Testament reveals their conviction that it is the very word of God." (Handbook on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament)

4. **Organic Inspiration**
    - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but a process involving the personalities and contexts of human authors.
    - The Spirit works through human means, preserving both divine intent and human expression.
    - This organic model upholds both the full humanity and full divinity of Scripture.
    - The result is a text that is both historically situated and universally authoritative.
    - "The Bible is a divine-human book, reflecting the characteristics of its authors while being wholly inspired by God." (The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism)

5. **Defense Against Contemporary Challenges**
    - Beale responds to recent evangelical critiques that undermine traditional inerrancy.
    - He addresses issues such as alleged contradictions and the use of the Old Testament in the New.
    - He argues that abandoning inerrancy leads to a weakened doctrine of Scripture’s authority.
    - Beale insists on the necessity of maintaining a high view of Scripture for the health of the church.
    - "The erosion of inerrancy inevitably leads to the erosion of the church’s confidence in the Bible’s authority." (The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed evangelical** discussions on **inspiration** and **inerrancy**, especially through his careful exegesis and defense of the New Testament’s use of the Old. His scholarship has provided a robust response to critics within evangelicalism who question the traditional doctrine of Scripture. Beale’s nuanced approach, attentive to both historical context and theological conviction, continues to influence pastors, scholars, and students committed to the authority of the Bible.
