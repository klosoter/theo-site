# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading voice in the Reformed tradition on the doctrines of **inspiration** and **inerrancy**, emphasizing the organic unity of **Scripture** as the Word of God and the centrality of **redemptive history**. He upholds the **verbal plenary inspiration** of the Bible, insisting that the authority and trustworthiness of Scripture are inseparable from its divine origin and Christological focus.

- "The authority of Scripture is inseparable from the authority of Christ, who speaks in and through the written Word." (God's Word in Servant-Form)

## Key Works

- God's Word in Servant-Form: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck on the Doctrine of Scripture
- "The New Testament as Canon" (in Inerrancy and Hermeneutic, ed. Harvie Conn)
- "The Inspiration and Authority of Scripture" (various essays and lectures)
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology (for implications on apostolic witness)
- Articles in Westminster Theological Journal on biblical authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Inspiration**
   - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but involves the full personality and context of the human authors.
   - The Holy Spirit superintends the process, ensuring the text is both fully human and fully divine.
   - The unity of Scripture is maintained through its organic development in redemptive history.
   - Inspiration is best understood in the context of the unfolding **history of revelation**.
   - "The Scriptures are the product of a process in which God sovereignly uses human agents in their historical circumstances." (God's Word in Servant-Form)

2. **Verbal Plenary Inspiration**
   - Every word of Scripture is inspired, not just the overarching ideas or doctrines.
   - The authority of the Bible extends to all its parts, including historical and factual details.
   - The inspiration of Scripture is comprehensive, covering both the Old and New Testaments.
   - This commitment safeguards the church’s confidence in the entirety of the biblical text.
   - "Inspiration extends to the very words of Scripture, not merely to its general content." (God's Word in Servant-Form)

3. **Inerrancy Rooted in Christology**
   - The truthfulness of Scripture is grounded in the character and authority of Christ.
   - Christ’s own view of the Old Testament is normative for the church’s doctrine of Scripture.
   - Inerrancy is not an abstract principle but is tied to the redemptive work and lordship of Christ.
   - The reliability of the apostolic witness is essential for the church’s faith and proclamation.
   - "The authority of Scripture is inseparable from the authority of Christ." (God's Word in Servant-Form)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Context**
   - The doctrine of inspiration must be understood within the unfolding of God’s redemptive acts.
   - Scripture’s unity is found in its testimony to Christ and the progress of redemption.
   - The canon is shaped by the history of revelation, culminating in the apostolic witness.
   - Inspiration is not static but dynamic, reflecting the movement of salvation history.
   - "Revelation and redemption are inseparably joined in the history recorded in Scripture." (The New Testament as Canon)

5. **Authority and Sufficiency of Scripture**
   - Scripture is the final and sufficient authority for faith and life.
   - The church is bound to the Word of God as its only infallible rule.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture is rooted in its divine inspiration and inerrancy.
   - The authority of Scripture is self-authenticating and does not rest on external validation.
   - "The church’s authority is always derivative, never independent of the Word of God." (God's Word in Servant-Form)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **inspiration** and **inerrancy**, especially in relation to the organic and redemptive-historical character of Scripture. He has influenced a generation of pastors and scholars at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond, emphasizing the inseparability of Christ, revelation, and biblical authority. His careful engagement with both historical and contemporary debates continues to provide a robust theological framework for understanding the nature of Scripture in the life of the church.
