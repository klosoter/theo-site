# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a robust doctrine of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** grounded in the authority of **Scripture** as the very Word of God. They affirm that the **Holy Spirit** superintended the writing of the biblical texts, ensuring their **infallibility** and **sufficiency** for faith and life. The Standards emphasize that the original manuscripts are without error and constitute the final rule of faith.

- "The Old Testament in Hebrew... and the New Testament in Greek... being immediately inspired by God, and, by His singular care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical." (Westminster Confession of Faith 1.8)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 1: "Of the Holy Scripture"
- The Larger Catechism, Questions 2–5
- The Shorter Catechism, Questions 2–3
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on the reading and preaching of Scripture)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (appendix to the Standards)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is the Word of God**
    - Scripture is given by **divine inspiration**, not merely human insight.
    - The authority of Scripture depends wholly upon God, not the testimony of any man or church.
    - The Bible is the supreme judge in all controversies of religion.
    - The Holy Spirit speaks through Scripture to the church.
    - "The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof." (WCF 1.4)

2. **Inspiration is Verbal and Plenary**
    - Every word of the original Hebrew and Greek texts is inspired.
    - Inspiration extends to all parts of Scripture, not just doctrinal or moral teachings.
    - The process of inspiration did not override the personalities or styles of the human authors.
    - The entire canon is equally inspired and authoritative.
    - "All which are given by inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life." (WCF 1.2)

3. **Scripture is Inerrant in the Autographs**
    - The original manuscripts are free from all error.
    - Apparent contradictions are due to transmission or interpretation, not the original text.
    - The purity of the text has been preserved by God’s providence.
    - Inerrancy is foundational for the trustworthiness of Scripture.
    - "The Scriptures of the Old and New Testament... being immediately inspired by God, and, by His singular care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical." (WCF 1.8)

4. **Scripture is Sufficient and Clear**
    - The Bible contains all things necessary for God’s glory, salvation, faith, and life.
    - Not all things are equally plain, but the essentials are clear to all who use ordinary means.
    - No new revelations are needed for faith or practice.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture guards against additions from tradition or human authority.
    - "The whole counsel of God... is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture." (WCF 1.6)

5. **The Holy Spirit Authenticates Scripture**
    - The inward work of the Holy Spirit is necessary for conviction of Scripture’s divine authority.
    - The Spirit enables believers to understand and embrace the truth of Scripture.
    - External evidences support, but do not establish, the authority of the Bible.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s truth comes from the Spirit’s testimony in the heart.
    - "Our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts." (WCF 1.5)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped the doctrine of **Scripture** in the Reformed tradition, establishing a benchmark for **inspiration** and **inerrancy** that continues to influence confessional statements worldwide. Their careful articulation of the authority, sufficiency, and clarity of Scripture has provided a foundation for theological education and ecclesiastical practice. The Standards remain a touchstone for debates on biblical authority, especially in the context of modern challenges to inerrancy. Their legacy endures in the ongoing commitment of Reformed churches to uphold the Bible as the inspired, inerrant Word of God.
