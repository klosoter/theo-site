# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann radically reinterpreted the doctrine of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** in light of his commitment to **demythologization** and existentialist hermeneutics. He rejected traditional views of **Scripture** as verbally inspired and inerrant, instead emphasizing the **kerygma**—the proclamation of Christ—as the locus of divine encounter within the biblical text.

- "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
   - Argues that the biblical text is clothed in mythological language shaped by its ancient worldview.
   - Seeks to reinterpret myths existentially rather than accept them as literal history.
   - Maintains that the true message of Scripture is accessible only when stripped of myth.
   - Views **inspiration** as the existential impact of the **kerygma**, not as verbal dictation.
   - "The real question is not whether the New Testament is mythological, but whether the mythological view of the world is true or not." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation**
   - Influenced by Heidegger, Bultmann interprets Scripture as addressing the individual's existence before God.
   - The authority of Scripture lies in its power to confront the reader with a decision of faith.
   - Inspiration is understood as the existential encounter, not as a property of the text itself.
   - Inerrancy is irrelevant, as the focus is on the existential truth, not historical or scientific accuracy.
   - "What matters is not the objective historicity of the events, but their existential meaning." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Rejection of Verbal Inspiration**
   - Denies that the Bible is the direct, error-free word of God in a propositional sense.
   - Asserts that the biblical writers were conditioned by their historical context and worldview.
   - Inspiration is dynamic and occurs in the act of proclamation and reception.
   - The text may contain errors or contradictions without undermining its theological significance.
   - "The word of God is not a fixed deposit, but an event that happens anew in every act of preaching." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Kerygma as the Center**
   - The **kerygma**, or proclamation of Christ, is the essential content of Christian faith.
   - The authority of Scripture is derivative from its witness to the kerygma, not from its inerrancy.
   - The task of theology is to interpret the kerygma for contemporary existence.
   - Inspiration is tied to the ongoing proclamation, not to the original manuscripts.
   - "Faith is not assent to doctrines, but an existential surrender to the kerygma." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Critical Engagement with Modernity**
   - Insists that Christian faith must be credible in the context of modern scientific and historical understanding.
   - Rejects supernaturalism and the possibility of a return to a pre-critical worldview.
   - Theological claims must be interpreted in a way that is intellectually honest for modern people.
   - Inspiration and inerrancy are redefined to avoid conflict with critical scholarship.
   - "We cannot use electric light and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **inspiration** and **inerrancy** profoundly shaped twentieth-century biblical scholarship, especially in the realms of **form criticism** and existential theology. His emphasis on **demythologization** challenged traditional doctrines and provoked significant debate within both liberal and conservative circles. While his views have been widely critiqued for undermining the authority of Scripture, his insistence on the existential encounter with the **kerygma** continues to influence contemporary hermeneutics and theology.
