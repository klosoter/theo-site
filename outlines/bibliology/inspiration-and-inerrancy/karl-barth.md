# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically redefined **inspiration** and **inerrancy** by grounding the authority of Scripture not in the text itself, but in the dynamic event of **God’s self-revelation** through the Word. For Barth, the Bible becomes the **Word of God** as it witnesses to Christ and is encountered by the Holy Spirit, rejecting traditional notions of **verbal plenary inspiration** and **propositional inerrancy**. His approach emphasizes the **Christological center** of revelation and the fallibility of the human witness in Scripture.

- "The Bible is God’s Word to the extent that God causes it to be His Word, to the extent that He speaks through it." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1 (The Doctrine of the Word of God)
- Church Dogmatics I/2 (The Doctrine of the Word of God)
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- The Word of God and the Word of Man

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Event, Not Object**
    - Revelation is a personal act of God, not a static deposit in Scripture.
    - The Bible witnesses to revelation but is not itself identical with revelation.
    - The event of God’s self-disclosure is primary; Scripture serves as its witness.
    - The authority of Scripture is derivative from the living Word, Jesus Christ.
    - "Revelation means the self-unveiling, impartation, and impartedness of God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Scripture as Witness to the Word**
    - The Bible is a human document that points beyond itself to Christ.
    - Its authority is real but always secondary to the living Word.
    - Inspiration is the Spirit’s work in making the text a means of revelation.
    - The Bible becomes the Word of God in the act of proclamation and hearing.
    - "The Bible is not in itself and as such God’s past revelation, but it attests it." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

3. **Rejection of Mechanical Inspiration**
    - Barth opposes the idea of dictation or mechanical transmission of divine truth.
    - Human authors are fully engaged, with their personalities and limitations.
    - Inspiration is not a guarantee of factual or scientific accuracy.
    - The Spirit uses fallible human words to communicate infallible divine truth.
    - "The prophets and apostles as such, even in their office, were real, historical men as we are." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

4. **Christological Center of Scripture**
    - All Scripture finds its unity and authority in its witness to Christ.
    - The Bible’s purpose is to direct readers to the living Lord, not to itself.
    - Christ is the true content and criterion of revelation.
    - The authority of Scripture is inseparable from its function as Christ’s witness.
    - "Jesus Christ is the one Word of God which we have to hear and which we have to trust and obey in life and in death." (Barmen Declaration)

5. **Critical Realism and Fallibility**
    - Barth acknowledges errors and contradictions in the biblical text.
    - Inerrancy is not necessary for Scripture’s authority or truthfulness.
    - The Spirit overcomes human limitations in the act of revelation.
    - Faith is not in the text’s perfection, but in God’s faithfulness to speak through it.
    - "The biblical writers were subject to error in their historical, scientific, and theological statements." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s approach to **inspiration** and **inerrancy** marked a decisive break from both liberal and fundamentalist positions, reshaping twentieth-century Protestant theology. His emphasis on the **living Word** and the event-character of revelation influenced neo-orthodoxy and continues to provoke debate about the nature of biblical authority. While criticized by some for undermining traditional doctrines of Scripture, Barth’s theology remains a touchstone for discussions of **revelation**, **Christology**, and the role of the Bible in the church.
