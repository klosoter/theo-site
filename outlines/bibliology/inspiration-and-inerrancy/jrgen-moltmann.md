# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **inspiration** and **inerrancy** through the lens of **eschatology**, **Trinitarian theology**, and the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit**. He critiques classical notions of **verbal inspiration** and **propositional inerrancy**, emphasizing instead the living, dialogical, and historical character of **Scripture** as the church’s witness to God’s self-revelation in Christ.

- "The Bible is not a book of oracles, but the witness of faith to the revelation of God in history." ("Theology of Hope")

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Spirit of Life: A Universal Affirmation (1991)
- The Church in the Power of the Spirit (1975)
- Experiences in Theology: Ways and Forms of Christian Theology (2000)
- God in Creation (1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Christocentric and Historical**
    - God's self-disclosure centers on the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - **Scripture** is a witness to God's acts in history, not a collection of timeless propositions.
    - The authority of the Bible derives from its testimony to the **eschatological event** of Christ.
    - Revelation unfolds in history and is oriented toward the future consummation.
    - "Revelation is not a communication of truths, but the self-giving of God in history." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Inspiration as the Work of the Spirit in Community**
    - The **Holy Spirit** inspires both the formation and ongoing interpretation of Scripture.
    - Inspiration is not a static event but a dynamic process involving the church.
    - The Spirit enables the community to discern God's voice in the biblical witness.
    - The authority of Scripture is actualized in the life and mission of the church.
    - "The inspiration of the Scriptures is not a property of the text, but an event in the community of faith." (The Spirit of Life)

3. **Rejection of Mechanical or Verbal Inerrancy**
    - Moltmann rejects the idea that the Bible is inerrant in every detail or word.
    - He views **inerrancy** as a modern, rationalistic construct foreign to the biblical witness.
    - The truth of Scripture is relational and existential, not merely factual or propositional.
    - Errors or contradictions in Scripture do not undermine its authority as witness.
    - "The Bible is not inerrant, but it is trustworthy as the witness to God's promise." (Experiences in Theology)

4. **Scripture as Witness, Not Oracle**
    - The Bible points beyond itself to the living God and God's promises.
    - It is a human document shaped by particular contexts, cultures, and histories.
    - The authority of Scripture lies in its function as testimony, not as a legal code.
    - The church must continually interpret Scripture in light of the **resurrection** and **eschatological hope**.
    - "Scripture is the witness, not the event; it is the signpost, not the destination." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Hermeneutics Oriented Toward Hope and Liberation**
    - Interpretation of Scripture is guided by the **eschatological hope** of God's coming kingdom.
    - The Bible inspires transformative action toward justice, liberation, and reconciliation.
    - Hermeneutics is a communal, Spirit-led process open to new insights.
    - The authority of Scripture is realized in its power to generate hope and renewal.
    - "The word of God is always a word of promise, opening up the future." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann's approach to **inspiration** and **inerrancy** has significantly influenced contemporary theology, especially in ecumenical and liberationist circles. By emphasizing the **dynamic, Christocentric, and Spirit-led** character of Scripture, he has challenged static and propositional views of biblical authority. His work has encouraged theologians to see the Bible as a living witness that calls the church into ongoing dialogue with God's future. Moltmann's legacy endures in discussions of **hermeneutics**, **revelation**, and the role of hope in Christian theology.
