# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame articulates a robust doctrine of **inspiration and inerrancy**, grounding the authority of **Scripture** in its identity as the very word of God. He emphasizes the **self-attesting** nature of the Bible, the organic relationship between divine and human authorship, and the necessity of a **presuppositional** commitment to biblical truth for all theological reflection.

- "The Bible is the word of God in such a way that to disbelieve or disobey any word of Scripture is to disbelieve or disobey God." ("The Doctrine of the Word of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- "Inerrancy: A Place to Live" in God's Inerrant Word (1974)
- "Scripture Speaks for Itself" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1974)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Divine Authorship**
   - Scripture is ultimately authored by God, making it absolutely authoritative.
   - Human authors are genuine participants, but their words are fully superintended by the Holy Spirit.
   - The divine origin of Scripture grounds its trustworthiness and inerrancy.
   - The authority of Scripture is not derived from the church or tradition.
   "The words of Scripture are God’s words in the fullest sense." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

2. **Inerrancy as a Necessary Consequence of Inspiration**
   - Inerrancy follows from the perfection and truthfulness of God.
   - The Bible, in its original manuscripts, is without error in all that it affirms.
   - Inerrancy applies to all areas: doctrine, history, and science, as intended by the biblical authors.
   - Frame rejects any bifurcation between spiritual and factual inerrancy.
   "If God cannot err, and if Scripture is God’s word, then Scripture cannot err." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

3. **Presuppositional Epistemology**
   - The authority of Scripture is self-authenticating and foundational for all knowledge.
   - Human reason is subordinate to the revelation of God in Scripture.
   - All attempts to judge Scripture by external standards are ultimately circular.
   - Faith in the Bible’s inspiration and inerrancy is a necessary presupposition for Christian theology.
   "We must presuppose the truth of God’s word in all our thinking." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

4. **Organic Inspiration**
   - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but involves the full personality and context of human authors.
   - The Holy Spirit works through the authors’ styles, vocabularies, and historical situations.
   - This organic process ensures both divine authority and genuine human expression.
   - The unity and diversity of Scripture reflect this organic inspiration.
   "God’s inspiration does not override the personalities of the human authors, but works through them." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Scripture’s Sufficiency and Clarity**
   - The Bible contains all that is necessary for faith and practice.
   - Scripture is clear in its essential teachings, accessible to all believers.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture undergirds its role as the final standard in theology.
   - Tradition and church authority are subordinate to the clear teaching of Scripture.
   "Scripture is sufficient for all matters of faith and life." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **inspiration and inerrancy** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially among those committed to a **presuppositional** approach. His emphasis on the self-attesting authority of Scripture and the organic nature of inspiration has provided a nuanced defense against both liberal and neo-orthodox critiques. Frame’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking a rigorous, confessional doctrine of **Scripture**.
