# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline advanced a distinctive approach to **inspiration and inerrancy** by situating **Scripture** within the framework of **covenant** and **divine authorship**. He emphasized the **organic inspiration** of the biblical text, arguing that the authority and truthfulness of Scripture are grounded in its role as a **covenant document** authored by God, and thus inherently **inerrant** in all it affirms.

- "The Bible is the written revelation of the Lord of the covenant, and as such it is invested with his authority and is wholly trustworthy." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

## Key Works

- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- Treaty of the Great King
- Kingdom Prologue
- By Oath Consigned
- "Because It Is Written" (Westminster Theological Journal article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Covenant Document**
    - Scripture is modeled after ancient Near Eastern **covenant treaties**, reflecting divine authorship.
    - The form and function of biblical texts are inseparable from their role as **legal instruments** of the covenant.
    - The authority of Scripture is rooted in its status as the **written will of the Suzerain** (God).
    - This covenantal structure undergirds both the **inspiration** and **inerrancy** of the text.
    - "The Bible is the documentary embodiment of the Lord’s covenant with his people." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

2. **Organic Inspiration**
    - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but involves the full engagement of human authors.
    - The Holy Spirit superintends the process, ensuring the **infallibility** of the message.
    - Human literary styles and historical contexts are preserved within the inspired text.
    - This view upholds both the **divine** and **human** elements in Scripture’s production.
    - "The Spirit’s work of inspiration did not override the individuality of the human writers." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

3. **Inerrancy Rooted in Divine Authorship**
    - The truthfulness of Scripture is guaranteed by its **divine origin**.
    - Inerrancy is not a later theological imposition but intrinsic to the nature of **God’s Word**.
    - All that Scripture affirms, whether in matters of faith, history, or creation, is without error.
    - The authority and reliability of Scripture are inseparable from its inerrancy.
    - "The inerrancy of Scripture is simply the corollary of its divine authorship." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

4. **Canonical Self-Attestation**
    - Scripture bears witness to its own authority and inspiration.
    - The **canon** is recognized, not constituted, by the church.
    - The self-authenticating nature of Scripture is tied to its covenantal function.
    - The Holy Spirit confirms the authority of Scripture to the believer.
    - "The canon is self-attesting because it is the voice of the covenant Lord." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

5. **Historical Reliability and Theological Unity**
    - The historical narratives of Scripture are trustworthy and integral to its theological message.
    - There is a unity between the **redemptive-historical** content and the inspired form.
    - Apparent discrepancies are to be understood in light of the literary and covenantal context.
    - The unity of Scripture’s message is a function of its single divine author.
    - "The unity of Scripture is the unity of the covenant Lord’s revelation in history." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal approach to **inspiration and inerrancy** has significantly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in its understanding of the relationship between **divine authority** and the form of Scripture. His work provided a robust defense of inerrancy rooted in the structure and function of the biblical canon. Kline’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of **biblical authority**, especially among those who seek to integrate historical, literary, and theological perspectives within a covenantal framework.
