# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a doctrine of **inspiration** grounded in the belief that **Sacred Scripture** is authored by both God and human writers, with God as the **principal cause** and the human as the **instrumental cause**. He affirmed the **truthfulness** and **authority** of Scripture, holding that it is free from error in matters necessary for **salvation**, while allowing for human modes of expression and historical context.

- "It is plain that nothing false can ever underlie the literal sense of Holy Writ." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.10)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I, q.1 ("The Nature and Extent of Sacred Doctrine")
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book I
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- Expositio super Isaiam ad litteram (Commentary on Isaiah)
- De Veritate (On Truth)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as Principal Author of Scripture**
    - God is the ultimate source of **revelation** and the primary author of Scripture.
    - Human authors are true authors but act as **instruments** moved by the Holy Spirit.
    - The divine authorship guarantees the **truth** and **authority** of the biblical text.
    - The process of inspiration does not override human faculties but elevates them.
    - "The author of Holy Writ is God, in whose power it is to signify His meaning, not by words only...but also by things themselves." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.10)

2. **Inerrancy in Matters of Faith and Salvation**
    - Scripture is without error in all that pertains to **faith** and **morals**.
    - Apparent contradictions or errors are due to human misunderstanding or textual corruption.
    - Aquinas distinguishes between the **literal** and **spiritual** senses, but both are ultimately true.
    - He allows for non-literal readings where the genre or context demands.
    - "Nothing false can ever underlie the literal sense of Holy Writ." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.10)

3. **Accommodation of Human Language**
    - Human authors use their own language, style, and cultural context.
    - God accommodates divine truth to human capacity through **figurative** and **imperfect** expressions.
    - The presence of diverse literary forms does not diminish the **divine authority** of Scripture.
    - Errors in transmission or translation do not impugn the original inspired text.
    - "Divine things are presented to us in Scripture in the manner which is most suitable to our knowledge." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.9)

4. **Unity of the Literal and Spiritual Senses**
    - The **literal sense** is foundational and always true.
    - **Spiritual senses** (allegorical, moral, anagogical) are grounded in the literal sense.
    - All senses are ultimately intended by God as the principal author.
    - The unity of senses reflects the unity of **divine truth**.
    - "All the senses of Holy Scripture are founded on one—the literal—from which alone can any argument be drawn." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.10)

5. **Role of the Church in Interpretation**
    - The **Magisterium** is entrusted with the authentic interpretation of Scripture.
    - The Church safeguards the **orthodox understanding** of inspiration and inerrancy.
    - Tradition and ecclesial authority guide the faithful in discerning the true sense of Scripture.
    - The Church’s teaching office prevents misinterpretation and doctrinal error.
    - "It is the task of the wise to order and to judge, and therefore the judgment concerning the truths of faith belongs above all to the supreme pontiff." (Summa Theologiae II-II, q.1, a.10)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** shaped the Roman Catholic doctrine of Scripture and influenced later **scholastic** and **Reformed** thought. His distinction between the **literal** and **spiritual senses** remains foundational for Catholic hermeneutics. Aquinas’s nuanced approach to the human and divine aspects of Scripture provided a framework for later debates on biblical authority, especially at the Council of Trent and Vatican I. His emphasis on the **truthfulness** of Scripture continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature and limits of inerrancy.
