# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **inspiration and inerrancy** is foundational for the Western theological tradition. He maintained that the **Holy Scriptures** are divinely inspired and therefore wholly **truthful** in all they affirm, grounding their authority in the work of the **Holy Spirit** and the unity of **Scripture** as the Word of God.

- "For it seems to me that most disastrous consequences must follow upon our believing that anything false is found in the sacred books." (Letter 82.3)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- De Doctrina Christiana (On Christian Doctrine)
- The City of God
- Letter 82 to Jerome
- Sermons and Expositions on the Psalms

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is divinely inspired**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the ultimate author of Scripture.
    - Human authors are instruments, but God ensures the truth of their words.
    - Inspiration applies to both Old and New Testaments.
    - The authority of Scripture rests on its divine origin.
    - "I have learned to yield this respect and honor only to the canonical books of Scripture: of these alone do I most firmly believe that the authors were completely free from error." (Letter 82.3)

2. **Inerrancy of Scripture**
    - Scripture, as inspired by God, is without error in all it teaches.
    - Apparent contradictions are due to human misunderstanding or textual corruption.
    - Augustine insists on the total truthfulness of the biblical text.
    - The inerrancy of Scripture is a corollary of its divine authorship.
    - "If I do find anything in these books which seems contrary to truth, I shall not hesitate to conclude that either the text is faulty or the translator has not caught the meaning of what was said, or I myself have failed to understand it." (Letter 82.3)

3. **Unity and coherence of Scripture**
    - All parts of Scripture are harmonious and consistent.
    - Difficult passages must be interpreted in light of the whole.
    - The unity of Scripture reflects the unity of God’s truth.
    - Augustine advocates for a canonical approach to interpretation.
    - "Let us treat the Scriptures of God as the face of God: melt in its presence." (Expositions on the Psalms, 43.4)

4. **Role of interpretation and humility**
    - Interpreters must approach Scripture with humility and prayer.
    - Augustine acknowledges the complexity of biblical texts.
    - The Church’s tradition aids in proper interpretation.
    - Errors in understanding are attributed to human limitations, not to Scripture itself.
    - "When Scripture seems to be in conflict with itself, it is we who are blind, not the Scriptures." (De Doctrina Christiana, III.27)

5. **Scripture as the supreme authority**
    - Scripture stands above all other authorities, including church leaders and tradition.
    - Augustine submits his own writings to correction by Scripture.
    - The **canon** of Scripture is the standard for Christian doctrine.
    - All theological claims must be measured against the biblical text.
    - "Therefore, whatever they say, if they prove it by the canonical Scriptures, let us believe it; but if they cannot prove it by the canonical Scriptures, let us not believe it." (Contra Epistolam Manichaei, 5.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s robust affirmation of **inspiration and inerrancy** shaped the doctrine of Scripture in both the medieval and Reformation eras. His insistence on the **divine authority** and **truthfulness** of the biblical text became a cornerstone for later Western theology. Augustine’s nuanced approach to interpretation and humility before Scripture continues to influence contemporary discussions on biblical authority and hermeneutics.
