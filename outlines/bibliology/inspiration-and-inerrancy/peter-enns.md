# Peter Enns (1961– )

Peter Enns is a contemporary biblical scholar who has challenged traditional evangelical understandings of **inspiration** and **inerrancy**. He argues that the **Bible’s humanity** is integral to its nature as Scripture, and that **ancient Near Eastern context** and literary forms must inform our doctrine of Scripture. Enns contends that **inerrancy** as classically defined is not demanded by the biblical text itself.

- "The Bible is, after all, not a collection of timeless truths but a story told by real people in real places at real times." ("Inspiration and Incarnation")

## Key Works

- Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament (2005)
- The Evolution of Adam: What the Bible Does and Doesn’t Say about Human Origins (2012)
- The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It (2014)
- How the Bible Actually Works (2019)
- "Inerrancy, Biblical Authority, and the Evangelical Crisis" (in Five Views on Biblical Inerrancy, 2013)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Humanity is Essential**
    - The Bible reflects the language, culture, and worldview of its human authors.
    - Inspiration does not override the ordinary processes of composition and transmission.
    - The presence of ancient Near Eastern parallels is not a threat to biblical authority.
    - Scripture’s “incarnational” nature means it is both divine and fully human.
    - "The Bible behaves in ways that are, frankly, not what we would expect from an inerrant text." (Inspiration and Incarnation)

2. **Inerrancy is a Post-Biblical Category**
    - The term “inerrancy” is not found in Scripture itself.
    - The Bible’s own claims about itself do not match modern definitions of inerrancy.
    - Historical and scientific difficulties in the text are not necessarily errors.
    - The doctrine of inerrancy arose in response to modern challenges, not from the biblical text.
    - "Inerrancy is a doctrine that is not demanded by the phenomena of the Bible itself." (Five Views on Biblical Inerrancy)

3. **Accommodation is Central to Inspiration**
    - God accommodates revelation to the cultural and intellectual limitations of the original audience.
    - Ancient cosmology and historical conventions are part of God’s communicative method.
    - Inspiration works through, not despite, the limitations of human authors.
    - Divine truth is expressed in culturally conditioned forms.
    - "God speaks by means of the cultural idioms of the people to whom he speaks." (Inspiration and Incarnation)

4. **Diversity and Tension within Scripture**
    - The Bible contains theological diversity and even apparent contradictions.
    - These tensions are not problems to be harmonized away but are part of Scripture’s witness.
    - Inspiration includes the process of dialogue and development within the canon.
    - The unity of Scripture is not uniformity.
    - "The Bible is not a rulebook or an owner’s manual, but a diverse collection of writings that reflect different times and places." (The Bible Tells Me So)

5. **Authority Rooted in Christ, Not Propositional Precision**
    - The authority of Scripture is ultimately grounded in the person and work of Christ.
    - The Bible’s purpose is to point to Christ, not to provide exhaustive information.
    - Faithfulness to Scripture means wrestling honestly with its complexities.
    - The church’s confession of Scripture’s authority is not dependent on inerrancy.
    - "The Bible is not the center of the Christian faith—Jesus is." (The Bible Tells Me So)

## Legacy and Impact

Peter Enns has been a provocative voice in contemporary debates over **biblical inspiration** and **inerrancy**, especially within evangelicalism. His work has prompted significant discussion about the nature of **Scripture’s humanity** and the adequacy of traditional doctrinal formulations. While controversial, Enns has encouraged many to engage more honestly with the complexities of the biblical text, fostering a more nuanced approach to **biblical authority**. His influence is seen both in academic circles and in broader conversations about faith and the Bible.
