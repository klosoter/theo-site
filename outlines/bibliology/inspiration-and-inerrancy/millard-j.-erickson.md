# Millard J. Erickson (1932– )

Millard J. Erickson is a leading evangelical theologian who affirms a nuanced view of **inspiration** and **inerrancy**. He upholds the authority of **Scripture** as the Word of God, emphasizing a **verbal-plenary inspiration** that is both historically rooted and responsive to contemporary challenges, while advocating a moderate, non-mechanical understanding of **biblical inerrancy**.

- "The Bible is fully trustworthy in all that it teaches, but this does not require a rigid literalism or a denial of the human element in its composition." (Christian Theology)

## Key Works

- Christian Theology (especially chapters on Scripture)
- Evangelical Interpretation: Perspectives on Hermeneutical Issues
- The Evangelical Left: Encountering Postconservative Evangelical Theology
- The Word Became Flesh: A Contemporary Incarnational Christology
- Introducing Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Verbal-Plenary Inspiration**
    - Scripture is inspired in all its words and parts, not just in broad concepts.
    - Inspiration extends to the whole of Scripture, ensuring its divine authority.
    - The process of inspiration respects the personalities and styles of human authors.
    - God superintended the writing without dictating mechanically.
    - "The inspiration of Scripture is both verbal and plenary, encompassing every part and word." (Christian Theology)

2. **Qualified Inerrancy**
    - Inerrancy is affirmed in the original autographs, not necessarily in every copy or translation.
    - Inerrancy is understood in terms of the intent and genre of the biblical text.
    - Apparent discrepancies are often due to misunderstandings of context or genre.
    - Inerrancy does not require scientific or historical precision by modern standards.
    - "The Bible is inerrant in what it affirms, but this must be understood according to the conventions of the time." (Christian Theology)

3. **Accommodation to Human Language**
    - God accommodated his revelation to human limitations and cultural context.
    - Scripture uses ordinary language, including phenomenological descriptions.
    - The human element in Scripture does not undermine its divine origin.
    - Inspiration operates through, not in spite of, human authorship.
    - "God’s message comes to us in the language and thought forms of the biblical writers." (Christian Theology)

4. **Scripture’s Authority and Sufficiency**
    - The Bible is the final authority for faith and practice.
    - Scripture is sufficient for salvation and Christian living.
    - Tradition and reason are subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
    - The authority of Scripture is grounded in its divine inspiration.
    - "Scripture is the supreme norm by which all other authorities are to be judged." (Christian Theology)

5. **Engagement with Contemporary Challenges**
    - Erickson addresses modern criticisms of biblical inspiration and inerrancy.
    - He seeks to articulate a doctrine of Scripture that is credible in the modern intellectual climate.
    - He interacts with both evangelical and non-evangelical perspectives.
    - His approach is mediating, aiming to avoid both fundamentalist rigidity and liberal reductionism.
    - "We must develop a doctrine of Scripture that is both faithful to the biblical witness and intellectually responsible." (Christian Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Erickson’s work has shaped evangelical discussions on **inspiration** and **inerrancy** by providing a balanced, scholarly, and accessible articulation of these doctrines. His moderate stance has influenced seminary education and evangelical engagement with critical scholarship. By emphasizing both the divine and human aspects of Scripture, Erickson has contributed to a robust doctrine of **biblical authority** that remains influential in contemporary theology.
