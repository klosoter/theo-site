# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen was a staunch defender of the **verbal plenary inspiration** and **inerrancy** of Scripture, standing firmly against the encroachment of **liberal theology** in the early twentieth century. He argued that the **authority of the Bible** is foundational for Christian doctrine and that the **original autographs** of Scripture are without error, making the Bible the ultimate standard for faith and practice.

- "The Bible is not merely the record of revelation; it is itself revelation." ("Christianity and Liberalism")

## Key Works

- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- The Origin of Paul's Religion (1921)
- The Christian Faith in the Modern World (1936)
- What Is Faith? (1925)
- The Virgin Birth of Christ (1930)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Verbal Plenary Inspiration**
   - Scripture is inspired in all its words, not just its ideas.
   - The Holy Spirit superintended the human authors without overriding their personalities.
   - Inspiration extends to every part of Scripture, making it wholly trustworthy.
   - The authority of the Bible rests on its divine origin.
   - "The inspiration of the Bible is not limited to certain parts or to certain kinds of material." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Inerrancy of the Original Autographs**
   - The original manuscripts are completely free from error.
   - Inerrancy applies to all matters, including history and science, as originally given.
   - Copyist errors do not undermine the doctrine of inerrancy.
   - The trustworthiness of Scripture is grounded in its inerrancy.
   - "The Bible, in the form in which it was originally given, is absolutely without error." (The Christian Faith in the Modern World)

3. **Scripture as the Supreme Authority**
   - The Bible stands above church tradition and human reason.
   - All doctrines must be tested by Scripture.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture is essential for Christian faith.
   - The church is bound to the teaching of the Bible.
   - "The Scriptures are the norm by which all other authorities are to be judged." (Christianity and Liberalism)

4. **Rejection of Liberal Views on Inspiration**
   - Liberal theology undermines the supernatural character of Scripture.
   - Machen opposed views that reduced inspiration to mere religious experience.
   - He critiqued the idea that the Bible contains, rather than is, the Word of God.
   - He saw liberalism as a different religion from historic Christianity.
   - "Liberalism regards the Bible as a record of human experiences, not as a divine revelation." (Christianity and Liberalism)

5. **Historical Reliability of Scripture**
   - The events recorded in Scripture are factual and essential to faith.
   - Christianity is rooted in historical revelation, not myth.
   - The truth of the gospel depends on the truthfulness of biblical history.
   - Machen defended the historicity of miracles and key doctrines.
   - "Christianity is based upon a message that is primarily historical." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s vigorous defense of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** shaped the contours of twentieth-century American **Reformed orthodoxy**. His work provided a robust intellectual foundation for the formation of Westminster Theological Seminary and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. Machen’s legacy endures in ongoing debates over the authority of Scripture, serving as a touchstone for conservative evangelical and Reformed commitments to biblical fidelity.
