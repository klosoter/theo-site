# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirmed the **divine inspiration** and **authority of Scripture**, emphasizing that the Bible is the very **Word of God** and thus wholly trustworthy. While Calvin did not use the later terminology of **inerrancy**, he insisted that Scripture is free from error in all that it intends to teach, grounding its truthfulness in the character of God Himself.

- "We owe to the Scripture the same reverence which we owe to God, because it has proceeded from Him alone, and has nothing of man mixed with it." (Institutes 1.7.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 1, chapters 6–10)
- Commentaries on Genesis, Psalms, and the Gospels
- Preface to the Geneva Bible
- Sermons and Letters (selected correspondence on Scripture)
- John Calvin: A Sixteenth-Century Portrait by William J. Bouwsma (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Inspired Word of God**
    - Scripture is the product of the **Holy Spirit** speaking through human authors.
    - The authority of Scripture derives from its divine origin, not from the church.
    - The Spirit’s inward testimony confirms the truth of Scripture to believers.
    - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but involves the full use of human faculties.
    - "The highest proof of Scripture derives in general from the fact that God in person speaks in it." (Institutes 1.7.4)

2. **Scripture’s Infallibility and Trustworthiness**
    - Scripture cannot deceive or be deceived because God is its author.
    - All that Scripture teaches is true and reliable for faith and practice.
    - Apparent discrepancies are due to human misunderstanding, not error in the text.
    - Calvin distinguishes between essential teachings and peripheral details.
    - "We hold that the Word of God is free from every stain or defect." (Commentary on 2 Timothy 3:16)

3. **Accommodation in Revelation**
    - God accommodates His revelation to human capacity and language.
    - The clarity of Scripture is maintained even as God stoops to human understanding.
    - Accommodation does not imply error or falsehood in Scripture.
    - This principle explains anthropomorphic language and cultural expressions.
    - "For who even of slight intelligence does not understand that, as nurses commonly do with infants, God is wont in a measure to ‘lisp’ in speaking to us?" (Institutes 1.13.1)

4. **The Sufficiency and Clarity of Scripture**
    - Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation and godly living.
    - The essential message of Scripture is clear, though some passages are obscure.
    - The church is subject to Scripture, not above it.
    - Tradition and councils are subordinate to the authority of the Bible.
    - "The Word of God is the foundation of all right knowledge." (Institutes 1.6.2)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Illumination**
    - The Holy Spirit enables believers to recognize and accept the authority of Scripture.
    - Without the Spirit’s work, human reason alone cannot grasp the truth of Scripture.
    - The Spirit’s testimony is distinct from rational proofs or external evidences.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s truth is ultimately a spiritual, not merely intellectual, conviction.
    - "Scripture will at once inspire full faith in those to whom the Holy Spirit gives understanding." (Institutes 1.7.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust doctrine of **inspiration** and his insistence on the **authority of Scripture** have profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition and later Protestant thought. His nuanced approach to **accommodation** and the Spirit’s testimony provided a foundation for later discussions of **inerrancy** and hermeneutics. Calvin’s influence endures in confessional standards and continues to inform debates on the nature and trustworthiness of the Bible.
