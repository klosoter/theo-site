# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the doctrines of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** through his method of **correlation**, emphasizing the symbolic and existential dimensions of **revelation**. He rejected a literalist or propositional understanding of **Scripture**, instead viewing the Bible as a witness to the **Word of God** that becomes revelatory in the encounter with the reader.

- "The Bible is not the Word of God in itself, but it becomes the Word of God in the event in which its message grasps us." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- The Protestant Era
- Theology of Culture
- Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Event, Not Proposition**
    - Revelation is not a deposit of information but an existential event.
    - The Bible mediates revelation but is not identical with it.
    - The encounter with the biblical message is where revelation occurs.
    - Revelation addresses the ultimate concerns of human existence.
    - "Revelation is not the communication of information, but the manifestation of the ground of being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Symbolic Nature of Scripture**
    - Biblical language is fundamentally symbolic, pointing beyond itself.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point.
    - Literalism distorts the true function of biblical symbols.
    - The power of Scripture lies in its ability to open up the depth of reality.
    - "Symbols are not signs; they participate in the reality to which they point." (Dynamics of Faith)

3. **Rejection of Inerrancy**
    - The Bible contains historical and scientific errors.
    - Inerrancy is a category mistake when applied to symbolic texts.
    - The truth of Scripture is existential, not factual or propositional.
    - Faith does not depend on the absence of error in the biblical text.
    - "The question of inerrancy is irrelevant to the truth of revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **The Word of God as Event**
    - The Word of God is not a static text but a dynamic event.
    - The Bible becomes the Word of God when it mediates revelation.
    - The Spirit actualizes the Word in the existential situation of the hearer.
    - The authority of Scripture is derivative from its revelatory power.
    - "The Bible is a witness to the Word of God, not the Word itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Correlation of Revelation and Human Existence**
    - Theology must relate revelation to the existential questions of humanity.
    - The meaning of inspiration is found in the correlation between divine message and human situation.
    - Revelation addresses the depth dimension of human life.
    - Theological method is dialogical, not deductive from Scripture alone.
    - "The method of correlation interprets revelation in relation to the questions posed by human existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **inspiration** and **inerrancy** profoundly shaped 20th-century liberal and existential theology, challenging traditional doctrines by emphasizing the symbolic and existential character of **revelation**. His rejection of inerrancy and focus on the event-character of the **Word of God** influenced later theologians who sought to relate Christian faith to modern thought. While controversial among confessional traditions, Tillich’s method of correlation remains a significant alternative in contemporary theological discussions.
