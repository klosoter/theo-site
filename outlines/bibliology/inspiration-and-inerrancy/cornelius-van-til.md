# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **inspiration** and **inerrancy** through the lens of **presuppositional apologetics**, insisting that the authority of Scripture is grounded in the self-attesting character of **divine revelation**. He argued that the Bible is the ultimate standard for truth, and its **inerrancy** is inseparable from its role as the foundation for all **epistemology** and **theology**.

- "The Bible is authoritative on everything of which it speaks. Moreover, it speaks of everything." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- A Christian Theory of Knowledge
- The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture (in The Infallible Word, co-authored)
- Common Grace and the Gospel

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Self-Attesting Revelation**
    - The authority of Scripture is not derived from external evidences but from its own nature as the Word of God.
    - Human reason is subordinate to the self-authenticating character of divine revelation.
    - The Holy Spirit enables believers to recognize the Bible’s authority.
    - Any denial of self-attestation leads to subjecting Scripture to autonomous human judgment.
    - "We must believe in the Bible because it is the voice of God speaking to us." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Organic Inspiration**
    - Inspiration involves the whole person of the biblical authors, not mechanical dictation.
    - God sovereignly superintended the process, ensuring the writers’ personalities and contexts were used without error.
    - The unity and diversity of Scripture reflect the organic nature of inspiration.
    - The doctrine preserves both divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
    - "The doctrine of organic inspiration is the only doctrine that does justice to the facts of Scripture." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Inerrancy as a Necessary Consequence of God’s Nature**
    - God’s truthfulness guarantees the inerrancy of His Word.
    - Any error in Scripture would undermine the character of God Himself.
    - Inerrancy is not limited to spiritual matters but extends to all that Scripture affirms.
    - The denial of inerrancy leads to epistemological relativism.
    - "If the Bible is not inerrant, then God is not true." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Antithesis Between Christian and Non-Christian Worldviews**
    - The doctrine of inspiration and inerrancy sets Christianity apart from all autonomous philosophies.
    - There is no neutral ground; all reasoning is either for or against God’s revelation.
    - Apologetics must presuppose the truth of Scripture rather than argue from a position of neutrality.
    - The antithesis is rooted in the Creator-creature distinction.
    - "There is no common ground between the believer and the unbeliever except what God Himself provides." (A Christian Theory of Knowledge)

5. **Covenantal Epistemology**
    - Knowledge is possible only through God’s covenantal revelation.
    - The covenant frames the relationship between God, Scripture, and human understanding.
    - The authority and inerrancy of Scripture are foundational for covenantal knowledge.
    - All attempts to know apart from God’s revelation result in futility.
    - "All human knowledge rests upon the revelation of God in Scripture." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** shaped generations of Reformed theologians and apologists, especially within the Westminster tradition. His emphasis on the self-attesting nature of Scripture and the necessity of presupposing its truthfulness remains influential in contemporary discussions of **biblical authority**. Van Til’s thought continues to challenge both critics and defenders of inerrancy to ground their theology in the triune God’s self-revelation.
