# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **inspiration** and **inerrancy** through the lens of **revelation as history**, emphasizing the self-disclosure of God in historical events, especially in the resurrection of Christ. He was critical of traditional notions of **verbal inspiration** and **inerrancy**, instead arguing that the authority of Scripture is rooted in its witness to God's acts in history, rather than in a doctrine of errorlessness.

- "The authority of Scripture rests on its witness to the historical revelation of God, not on a theory of its inerrancy." (Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Revelation as History (ed. Pannenberg, 1968)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1–3 (1991–1998)
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 1–3 (1970–1973)
- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Theology and the Philosophy of Science (1976)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Historical, Not Propositional**
    - Revelation occurs through God's acts in history, culminating in Jesus Christ.
    - Scripture is a witness to these historical events, not itself the revelation.
    - The meaning and authority of Scripture depend on its relation to God's historical self-disclosure.
    - Revelation is open to public verification, not a private or mystical event.
    - "Revelation is not given in the form of timeless truths but in the historical acts of God." (Revelation as History)

2. **Scripture as Witness, Not Itself Revelation**
    - The Bible testifies to God's revelation but is not identical with revelation.
    - Inspiration refers to the Spirit's guidance of the biblical authors as witnesses.
    - The authority of Scripture is derivative, grounded in the events it records.
    - The church recognizes the canon as the normative witness to revelation.
    - "Scripture is the original and normative witness to revelation, but not revelation itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Critical Engagement with Inerrancy**
    - Pannenberg rejects strict **inerrancy** as unnecessary and unhelpful.
    - He acknowledges the presence of historical and scientific difficulties in the text.
    - The truth of Scripture is tied to its witness to Christ, not to factual precision.
    - Theological focus should remain on the reliability of the gospel message.
    - "The truth of Scripture is not in its inerrancy but in its witness to the truth of God’s revelation." (Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Openness to Historical-Critical Method**
    - Pannenberg affirms the legitimacy of historical-critical scholarship.
    - He sees critical methods as tools for clarifying the meaning of the biblical witness.
    - Theological claims must be open to rational and historical scrutiny.
    - Faith is not opposed to reason but invites examination of its historical basis.
    - "Theology must not fear the results of historical criticism, for faith is grounded in history." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

5. **Eschatological Verification of Revelation**
    - Full meaning and truth of revelation will be confirmed at the end of history.
    - Present understanding of Scripture is provisional and anticipatory.
    - The authority of Scripture is eschatologically oriented, looking to the future fulfillment.
    - The openness of history is essential to the nature of revelation and its witness.
    - "The final confirmation of revelation and its witness in Scripture awaits the eschaton." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to **inspiration** and **inerrancy** challenged both conservative and liberal paradigms by rooting the authority of Scripture in the public, historical acts of God rather than in a doctrine of textual perfection. His emphasis on **revelation as history** has influenced contemporary theology’s engagement with historical-critical methods and the relationship between faith and reason. While his views have been critiqued by proponents of traditional inerrancy, Pannenberg remains a pivotal figure in 20th-century theology for reframing the discussion around the historical and eschatological dimensions of biblical authority.
