# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge was a leading defender of the **verbal plenary inspiration** and **inerrancy** of Scripture within the Reformed tradition. He maintained that the **Bible** is the **Word of God**, wholly trustworthy and authoritative, with its authority grounded in its divine origin and inspiration.

- "If the Bible be the word of God, then it is infallible, and its authority is ultimate." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Verbal Plenary Inspiration**
    - Every word of Scripture is inspired by the **Holy Spirit**, not merely the ideas.
    - Inspiration extends to all parts of the Bible, not just doctrinal or moral teachings.
    - The human authors were fully involved, yet their words were superintended by God.
    - This view safeguards the authority and reliability of the entire canon.
    "The Scriptures are the word of God, not only as to their contents, but as to the words in which those contents are presented." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Scriptural Inerrancy**
    - The original manuscripts of Scripture are without error in all they affirm.
    - Inerrancy applies to historical, scientific, and theological statements alike.
    - Apparent discrepancies are due to copyist errors or misunderstandings, not to the original text.
    - The truthfulness of God guarantees the truthfulness of His Word.
    "The Bible is to the Christian the infallible rule of faith and practice." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Organic Inspiration**
    - Inspiration does not override the personalities or styles of the human authors.
    - God used the individual gifts, backgrounds, and vocabularies of each writer.
    - The process is analogous to the **incarnation**: fully divine and fully human.
    - This avoids mechanical dictation theories while upholding divine authorship.
    "The sacred writers were not machines, but living, thinking, willing men." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Authority of Scripture**
    - The Bible is the supreme and final authority in all matters of faith and life.
    - Church tradition and reason are subordinate to the clear teaching of Scripture.
    - The authority of Scripture is self-authenticating, confirmed by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - All doctrines must be tested by the Word of God.
    "The Scriptures alone are the rule of faith." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Rejection of Modern Criticism**
    - Hodge opposed higher criticism that undermined the trustworthiness of Scripture.
    - He defended the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch and the historicity of biblical events.
    - He saw rationalistic approaches as threats to Christian doctrine and piety.
    - Hodge insisted that faith in inspiration and inerrancy is essential for orthodoxy.
    "To admit error in the Bible is to destroy its authority." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Charles Hodge’s robust defense of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** shaped the theological identity of Old Princeton and set a standard for later Reformed orthodoxy. His views became foundational for American Presbyterianism and influenced the rise of the **Princeton School**. Hodge’s legacy endures in contemporary evangelical affirmations of biblical authority, especially in debates over the nature and trustworthiness of Scripture.
