# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate the classic **Reformed doctrine of Scripture**. They uphold the **inspiration**, **inerrancy**, and **sufficiency** of the **Holy Scriptures** as the final authority for faith and life, insisting that all doctrine and practice must be tested by the Word of God.

- "We believe that this Holy Scripture fully contains the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 2–7
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Questions 19, 21, 65, 67, 91
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Rejection of Errors, First Head
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard collected editions)
- The Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Inspired Word of God**
    - Scripture is described as "from heaven" and "proceeding from the mouth of God."
    - The confessions reject any notion that Scripture is a merely human product.
    - The Holy Spirit is affirmed as the divine author, working through human writers.
    - Inspiration guarantees the authority and trustworthiness of the biblical text.
    "We receive all these books, and these only, as holy and canonical, for the regulation, foundation, and confirmation of our faith." (Belgic Confession, Article 5)

2. **Inerrancy and Infallibility of Scripture**
    - Scripture is said to be "without error" in all it affirms.
    - The confessions insist that the Bible is "sufficient" and "perfect" for salvation and doctrine.
    - Any contradiction or error is attributed to human misunderstanding, not to the text itself.
    - The authority of Scripture is not dependent on the church but on God alone.
    "Neither may we consider any writings of men, however holy these men may have been, of equal value with those divine Scriptures." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

3. **Sufficiency and Clarity of Scripture**
    - Scripture is declared sufficient for all matters of faith and salvation.
    - The confessions teach that the essential teachings of Scripture are clear and accessible to believers.
    - Human traditions and extra-biblical revelations are rejected as sources of doctrine.
    - The church is bound to teach only what is found in Scripture.
    "For since it is forbidden to add unto or take away anything from the Word of God, it does thereby evidently appear that the doctrine thereof is most perfect and complete in all respects." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

4. **Scripture as the Final Authority**
    - All doctrines and practices must be tested by the Word of God.
    - The church is subject to Scripture, not above it.
    - Councils and church fathers are subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
    - The confessions stress that faith must rest on the testimony of Scripture alone.
    "We believe, without a doubt, all things contained in them—not so much because the church receives and approves them as such, but more especially because the Holy Spirit witnesses in our hearts that they are from God." (Belgic Confession, Article 5)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Illumination**
    - The confessions affirm that the Holy Spirit enables believers to understand and receive Scripture.
    - Illumination is necessary due to human sin and blindness.
    - The Spirit works through the Word to produce faith and obedience.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s truth comes from the inward work of the Spirit, not external authority.
    "The Holy Spirit witnesses in our hearts that they are from God, whereof they carry the evidence in themselves." (Belgic Confession, Article 5)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the doctrine of Scripture in the continental **Reformed tradition**, providing a confessional standard for churches in the Netherlands and beyond. Their robust affirmation of **inspiration**, **inerrancy**, and the **sufficiency of Scripture** continues to influence Reformed theology and practice globally. These confessions remain foundational for understanding the Reformed approach to biblical authority and the relationship between Scripture and tradition.
