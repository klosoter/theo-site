# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **divine inspiration** of Scripture, holding that the Bible is the unique and authoritative **Word of God**. While he upheld the **truthfulness** and **authority** of the biblical text, Luther’s approach to **inerrancy** was nuanced, prioritizing the message of **Christ** and the **gospel** as the heart of Scripture’s reliability.

- "The true rule is this: God’s Word shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel can do so." (Smalcald Articles)

## Key Works

- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- Preface to the New Testament (1522)
- Table Talk (Tischreden)
- Lectures on Genesis
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 33: Career of the Reformer III

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole Authority (Sola Scriptura)**
   - Scripture alone is the final authority in matters of faith and doctrine.
   - Church tradition and councils are subordinate to the Bible.
   - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are foundational.
   - All doctrines must be tested by the Word of God.
   - "The Word of God shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel." (Smalcald Articles)

2. **Christocentric Interpretation**
   - The central message of Scripture is Christ and the gospel.
   - Passages are to be interpreted in light of their witness to Christ.
   - The authority of Scripture is tied to its proclamation of Christ.
   - Luther sometimes questioned the canonicity of books that did not clearly preach Christ.
   - "What does not teach Christ is not apostolic, even though it be taught by Peter or Paul." (Preface to James and Jude)

3. **Divine Inspiration of Scripture**
   - The Bible is inspired by the Holy Spirit.
   - Inspiration guarantees the trustworthiness of the message.
   - The Spirit works through the Word to create faith.
   - The authority of Scripture is rooted in its divine origin.
   - "The Holy Spirit Himself and God, the Creator of all things, is the Author of this book." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Practical Inerrancy Focused on Salvation**
   - Luther emphasized the infallibility of Scripture in matters of faith and salvation.
   - He did not insist on technical inerrancy in historical or scientific details.
   - The reliability of Scripture is anchored in its ability to make one wise unto salvation.
   - Apparent discrepancies do not undermine the gospel’s truth.
   - "Scripture cannot err. The Scriptures have never erred." (Lectures on Genesis)

5. **Canon and the Word of God**
   - Luther distinguished between the Word of God and the canon.
   - He evaluated books based on their witness to Christ.
   - Some canonical books were considered of lesser value if they did not clearly proclaim the gospel.
   - The canon is not self-authenticating apart from its proclamation of Christ.
   - "St. James’ epistle is really an epistle of straw, compared to these others, for it has nothing of the nature of the gospel about it." (Preface to the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s approach to **inspiration and inerrancy** shaped the Protestant understanding of **biblical authority**, especially through his emphasis on **sola Scriptura** and the centrality of Christ in interpretation. His nuanced view of inerrancy, prioritizing the gospel over technical precision, influenced later Lutheran and Reformed traditions. Luther’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of biblical inspiration and the proper use of Scripture in theology and the church.
