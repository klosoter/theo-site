# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robust doctrine of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** rooted in the authority of **Scripture** as the very Word of God. He emphasized the **organic inspiration** of the biblical text, affirming both the full **divine authority** and the genuine human authorship of the Bible, and maintained that **inerrancy** is a necessary consequence of Scripture's divine origin.

- "If Scripture is the Word of God written, then it must bear the character of inerrancy and infallibility." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- "The Infallibility of Scripture" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- "The Attestation of Scripture" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- Principles of Conduct
- "The Nature of Scripture" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1942)
- Redemption Accomplished and Applied (relevant for his doctrine of revelation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Word of God**
   - Scripture is not merely a record of revelation but is itself **revelation**.
   - The authority of Scripture derives from its divine authorship.
   - The Bible is the supreme standard for faith and life.
   - Human authors were instruments through whom God spoke.
   - "The Bible is not simply the record of revelation; it is itself revelation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

2. **Organic Inspiration**
   - Inspiration involves both divine and human elements.
   - The Holy Spirit superintended the process without overriding human personality.
   - The result is a text that is fully God's Word and genuinely human.
   - Organic inspiration avoids mechanical dictation theories.
   - "The inspiration of Scripture is organic, not mechanical." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

3. **Inerrancy as a Necessary Consequence**
   - Inerrancy flows from the character of God as truthful.
   - Scripture, as God's Word, cannot contain error in its original autographs.
   - Inerrancy applies to all that Scripture affirms, not just matters of faith and practice.
   - Denial of inerrancy undermines the authority of Scripture.
   - "If God is true, his Word must be true also." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

4. **Self-Attestation of Scripture**
   - Scripture bears witness to its own divine origin and authority.
   - The internal testimony of the Holy Spirit confirms this witness to believers.
   - The authority of Scripture is not dependent on external validation.
   - Self-attestation is essential for a truly Reformed doctrine of Scripture.
   - "The witness which Scripture bears to itself is the witness of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

5. **Unity of Scripture**
   - The Bible is a coherent, unified revelation from God.
   - There is a fundamental harmony between the Old and New Testaments.
   - Apparent discrepancies must be interpreted in light of this unity.
   - The unity of Scripture supports its reliability and trustworthiness.
   - "There is a unity and harmony in the witness of Scripture that bespeaks its divine origin." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray's defense of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** has had a lasting influence on Reformed and evangelical understandings of **Scripture**. His careful articulation of organic inspiration and the necessity of inerrancy has shaped generations of theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. Murray's work continues to be a standard reference for those upholding the authority and reliability of the Bible in academic and ecclesiastical contexts.
