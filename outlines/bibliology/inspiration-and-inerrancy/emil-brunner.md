# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **inspiration** and **inerrancy** from a dialectical and existential perspective, emphasizing the dynamic encounter between the **Word of God** and the human reader. He rejected the notion of **verbal plenary inspiration** and **absolute inerrancy**, instead arguing that Scripture becomes the Word of God in the event of revelation, rather than being inherently infallible in every detail. For Brunner, the authority of Scripture lies in its function as a witness to **divine revelation**, not in its flawless transmission of facts.

- "The Bible is not in itself the Word of God, but it becomes the Word of God when God speaks through it." (Revelation and Reason)

## Key Works

- Revelation and Reason (1946)
- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- Dogmatics, Vol. 1: The Christian Doctrine of God (1949)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Personal Encounter**
    - Revelation is fundamentally a meeting between God and the human person, not the communication of propositions.
    - The authority of Scripture derives from its role as a medium for this encounter.
    - The Bible is a witness to revelation, not revelation itself in a static sense.
    - The event of God’s self-disclosure is primary over the written text.
    - "Revelation is always an event, never a thing." (Revelation and Reason)

2. **Scripture as Witness, Not Identity, with the Word**
    - Scripture points beyond itself to the living Christ, the true **Word of God**.
    - The Bible’s authority is derivative, not inherent or automatic.
    - The text becomes authoritative as it is used by the Holy Spirit.
    - The distinction between the Word of God and the words of the Bible is crucial.
    - "The Bible is the record of revelation, not revelation itself." (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Rejection of Verbal Plenary Inspiration**
    - Brunner denied that every word of Scripture is directly inspired by God.
    - He critiqued mechanical or dictation theories of inspiration as unbiblical.
    - Inspiration is understood as the Spirit’s work in the encounter, not in the text’s origin.
    - Human authorship and cultural context are integral to Scripture’s form.
    - "The doctrine of verbal inspiration is a misunderstanding of the nature of revelation." (Revelation and Reason)

4. **Qualified View of Inerrancy**
    - Brunner did not affirm the **inerrancy** of Scripture in historical or scientific matters.
    - He argued that the Bible contains errors and contradictions in its human aspects.
    - The truth of Scripture is found in its message, not in factual precision.
    - The authority of Scripture is theological, not empirical or historical.
    - "The Bible is true in what it intends to say about God, not in every detail of fact." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Inspiration**
    - The Spirit’s work is to make the text effective as God’s Word in the present.
    - Inspiration is ongoing, occurring in the act of reading and hearing.
    - The Spirit bridges the gap between the ancient text and the contemporary reader.
    - The authority of Scripture is actualized in the Spirit-led encounter.
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who makes the words of Scripture the Word of God for us." (Truth as Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **inspiration** and **inerrancy** significantly shaped neo-orthodox and existentialist theology, challenging traditional Reformed and evangelical doctrines. His emphasis on the **event-character of revelation** influenced later theologians who sought to balance biblical authority with historical criticism. While his views were controversial among confessional Protestants, Brunner’s work remains a touchstone for discussions about the dynamic and relational nature of Scripture’s authority. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between the **Word of God** and the words of the Bible.
