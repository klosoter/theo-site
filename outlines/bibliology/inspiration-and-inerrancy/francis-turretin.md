# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin was a leading voice in the **Reformed scholastic tradition**, articulating a robust doctrine of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** grounded in the authority of **Scripture** as the Word of God. He maintained that the **autographs** of Scripture were divinely inspired, rendering them free from error, and that this inspiration extended to the very words and not merely the ideas. Turretin’s careful distinctions and defense of **verbal plenary inspiration** became foundational for later Reformed theology.

- "The Scriptures are inspired not only as to the sense, but also as to the words." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Catechism for the Churches of Geneva
- Selected Questions on the Doctrine of Scripture (various loci in Institutes)
- Secondary: Richard A. Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Holy Scripture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Verbal Plenary Inspiration**
    - Inspiration extends to every word of the original texts, not just the general ideas.
    - The Holy Spirit superintended the human authors to ensure the exact communication of God’s will.
    - The authority of Scripture is rooted in its divine origin, not in ecclesiastical approval.
    - Inspiration is both plenary (entirety of Scripture) and verbal (down to the words themselves).
    - "We contend that not only the things, but the very words, were inspired by God." (Institutes)

2. **Inerrancy of the Autographs**
    - The original manuscripts of Scripture are without error in all they affirm.
    - Apparent contradictions are due to copyist errors or misunderstandings, not to the original text.
    - Inerrancy applies to all matters, including history and science, as far as Scripture speaks.
    - The perfection of Scripture is a necessary consequence of its divine authorship.
    - "The Scriptures in their original autographs are pure and free from all error." (Institutes)

3. **Distinction Between Autographs and Apographs**
    - Turretin distinguishes between the inspired originals (autographs) and later copies (apographs).
    - While only the autographs are strictly inerrant, the apographs are sufficiently preserved for doctrine.
    - The reliability of the apographs is affirmed, but minor scribal errors do not undermine doctrine.
    - The church’s task is to preserve and transmit the text as faithfully as possible.
    - "Although the original autographs alone are absolutely authentic, the faithful copies are sufficient for faith and practice." (Institutes)

4. **Self-Authentication of Scripture**
    - Scripture possesses intrinsic authority as the Word of God, independent of human testimony.
    - The internal witness of the Holy Spirit confirms the divine origin of Scripture to believers.
    - The marks of divinity in Scripture (majesty, purity, efficacy) testify to its inspiration.
    - The church recognizes, but does not confer, the authority of Scripture.
    - "Scripture is autopistos, having its authority from itself, not from the church." (Institutes)

5. **Rejection of Mechanical Inspiration**
    - Turretin rejects the idea that biblical authors were passive instruments (dictation theory).
    - Inspiration is organic: God used the personalities, styles, and circumstances of the human authors.
    - The result is a fully divine and fully human text, without error or loss of individuality.
    - The Spirit’s superintendence ensured the truthfulness and sufficiency of every part.
    - "The sacred writers were not mere machines, but acted with full consciousness under divine guidance." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of **inspiration** and **inerrancy** shaped the confessional standards of the Reformed tradition, especially influencing the Westminster Confession of Faith and later Protestant orthodoxy. His careful distinctions between autographs and apographs, and his defense of verbal plenary inspiration, provided a framework for addressing textual and doctrinal challenges. Turretin’s legacy endures in contemporary debates over the authority and reliability of Scripture, making him a central figure in the doctrine of **Scripture** within Reformed theology.
