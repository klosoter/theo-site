# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **role of the Holy Spirit** in **revelation** and **illumination** through the lens of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He argued that the **Holy Spirit** is not a supernatural agent imparting propositional truths, but rather the means by which the **kerygma** becomes existentially meaningful to the individual, enabling authentic faith in the modern world.

- "The Holy Spirit is not a magical power but the power of the kerygma as it encounters the hearer." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Revelation**
   - Revelation must be freed from mythological worldviews to be intelligible today.
   - The Holy Spirit is not a supernatural force acting externally but is encountered in existential decision.
   - The biblical message is mediated through existential interpretation, not supernatural events.
   - Revelation is the event of the kerygma confronting the individual with a call to authentic existence.
   - "To believe in the Holy Spirit is to be open to the word as it addresses me here and now." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter with the Kerygma**
   - The Holy Spirit enables the existential encounter with the proclamation of Christ.
   - Illumination is not cognitive enlightenment but personal transformation.
   - Faith arises as the individual is grasped by the existential demand of the gospel.
   - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the act of hearing and responding to the kerygma.
   - "The Spirit is present where the word is proclaimed and accepted in faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Revelation as Event, Not Information**
   - Revelation is not the communication of doctrinal content but an existential event.
   - The Holy Spirit actualizes revelation in the moment of personal decision.
   - The focus is on the transformation of existence, not the imparting of new knowledge.
   - The Spirit’s role is to make the kerygma a present reality for the hearer.
   - "Revelation occurs only as an event in which man is addressed and called to decision." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Subjectivity and Faith**
   - The Holy Spirit’s work is realized in the subjective response of faith.
   - Illumination is the awakening of authentic self-understanding before God.
   - The Spirit does not guarantee objective certainty but calls for existential commitment.
   - Faith is a personal response to the existential address of the gospel.
   - "Faith is the openness to the future which the Spirit creates." (History and Eschatology)

5. **Critique of Supernaturalism**
   - Bultmann rejects a supernaturalistic understanding of the Spirit’s role.
   - The Holy Spirit is not a metaphysical entity intervening in history.
   - The Spirit’s presence is discerned in the existential transformation of the believer.
   - The focus is on the existential significance of the message, not miraculous phenomena.
   - "The Spirit is not a cosmic force but the power of new life experienced in faith." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **Holy Spirit** in revelation and illumination profoundly shaped twentieth-century **biblical hermeneutics** and existential theology. His emphasis on **demythologization** and existential encounter challenged traditional views of supernatural revelation, influencing both liberal and neo-orthodox thought. While controversial for his rejection of supernaturalism, Bultmann’s work remains pivotal in debates over the nature of revelation, the role of the Spirit, and the existential appropriation of faith. His legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the relevance of the gospel in a modern, secular context.
