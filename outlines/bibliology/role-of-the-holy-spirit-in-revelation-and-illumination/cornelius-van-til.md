# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til emphasized the indispensable role of the **Holy Spirit** in both the **objective revelation** of God and the **subjective illumination** of the believer. For Van Til, true knowledge of God is impossible apart from the Spirit’s work, which enables fallen humans to rightly interpret **special revelation** and to submit to the authority of **Scripture**. The Spirit’s ministry is thus central to both the giving and the receiving of divine truth.

- "It is only by the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit that man can see the kingdom of God and understand the revelation that God has given of himself." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of Scripture
- Christian Apologetics
- Revelation and Reason (with Greg L. Bahnsen)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Trinitarian and Spirit-Enabled**
   - God’s self-revelation is a triune act, with the Holy Spirit applying and actualizing revelation in the hearts of believers.
   - The Spirit ensures that revelation is not merely propositional but also personal and relational.
   - Without the Spirit, revelation remains external and ineffectual for fallen humanity.
   - The Spirit’s work is necessary to bridge the Creator-creature distinction in epistemology.
   - "The Holy Spirit must open the eyes of men if they are to see the facts of revelation as they truly are." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Illumination Overcomes Noetic Effects of Sin**
   - Human reason is corrupted by sin, rendering natural man incapable of rightly interpreting revelation.
   - The Spirit’s illumination renews the mind, enabling true understanding of Scripture.
   - Illumination is not the addition of new content but the removal of spiritual blindness.
   - The Spirit’s work is both epistemological and ethical, restoring the whole person to God.
   - "The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Scripture’s Authority is Spirit-Testified**
   - The authority of Scripture is self-attesting, but the Spirit must witness to its truth in the believer’s heart.
   - The Spirit’s testimony is not a supplement to Scripture but the means by which its authority is recognized.
   - Faith in Scripture’s authority is a gift of the Spirit, not a product of autonomous reason.
   - The Spirit’s witness is necessary for certainty and assurance in the knowledge of God.
   - "The testimony of the Holy Spirit is the only ultimate ground for the acceptance of Scripture as the Word of God." (The Doctrine of Scripture)

4. **Revelation is Covenantal and Redemptive**
   - The Spirit’s role in revelation is inseparable from the unfolding of God’s redemptive covenant.
   - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work, including the knowledge of God, to the elect.
   - Revelation is always given within the context of God’s covenantal relationship with his people.
   - The Spirit’s illumination is thus both revelatory and salvific.
   - "All revelation is covenantal, and the Holy Spirit is the agent who brings covenant knowledge to fruition." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Apologetics Depends on the Spirit’s Work**
   - The defense of the faith is futile apart from the Spirit’s regenerating and illuminating activity.
   - The apologist must presuppose the necessity of the Spirit in all reasoning and argumentation.
   - Only the Spirit can bring about conviction and conversion through apologetic witness.
   - The Spirit’s work ensures that apologetics is a spiritual, not merely intellectual, endeavor.
   - "It is the Holy Spirit who must give men eyes to see and ears to hear the truth of God’s revelation." (Christian Apologetics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust emphasis on the **Holy Spirit’s role in revelation and illumination** has profoundly shaped Reformed epistemology and presuppositional apologetics. His insistence on the necessity of the Spirit for both the objective authority and subjective reception of Scripture remains influential in contemporary discussions of **revelation** and **hermeneutics**. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to a Trinitarian, Spirit-dependent approach to theology and apologetics within the Reformed tradition.
