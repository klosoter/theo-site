# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity present a comprehensive doctrine of the **Holy Spirit**, emphasizing His essential role in **revelation**, **illumination**, and the application of **salvation**. These confessional standards assert that the **Scriptures** are inspired by the Spirit and that genuine understanding and faith are possible only through His inward work in the hearts of believers.

- "We believe that this Holy Scripture fully contains the will of God and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein... neither may we consider any writings of men, however holy, of equal value with those divine Scriptures." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561)
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563)
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical and Reformed Creeds and Confessions)
- The Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (James T. Dennison, Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit as Divine Author of Scripture**
    - The Spirit is the primary agent of **inspiration**, ensuring the Scriptures are the true and infallible Word of God.
    - The authority of Scripture is grounded in its divine origin, not in the church or human testimony.
    - The Spirit's work guarantees the unity and coherence of the biblical canon.
    - The confessions reject any human writings as equal to or above the Spirit-inspired Scriptures.
    - "We receive all these books, and these only, as holy and canonical, for the regulation, foundation, and confirmation of our faith." (Belgic Confession, Art. 5)

2. **Illumination by the Spirit**
    - The Spirit must open the hearts and minds of readers for them to truly understand and accept Scripture.
    - Human reason alone is insufficient to grasp spiritual truths without the Spirit's inward work.
    - The confessions emphasize the necessity of prayer for illumination.
    - The Spirit applies the objective Word subjectively to the believer.
    - "Faith is not only a certain knowledge... but also an assured confidence, which the Holy Ghost works by the gospel in my heart." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 21)

3. **The Spirit’s Role in Regeneration and Faith**
    - The Spirit sovereignly regenerates the elect, enabling them to respond to the gospel.
    - Faith itself is a gift of the Spirit, not a product of human effort.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ and applies all His benefits.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in the Spirit’s testimony within the believer.
    - "That others who are called by the gospel obey the call and are converted is not to be ascribed to free will, but to God, who as He has chosen His own from eternity, so He calls them effectually by His Word and Spirit." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.10)

4. **The Spirit and the Church**
    - The Spirit gathers, protects, and preserves the true church throughout history.
    - The marks of the true church are the pure preaching of the Word, the administration of the sacraments, and church discipline—all empowered by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit equips the church for ministry and sanctification.
    - The confessions stress the unity of the church as a work of the Spirit.
    - "This holy church is preserved by God against the rage of the whole world, though for a while it may look very small." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

5. **The Spirit’s Work in Sanctification**
    - The Spirit indwells believers, producing true repentance and new obedience.
    - Sanctification is a continual work of the Spirit, not merely a human endeavor.
    - Good works are the fruit of the Spirit’s renewing power.
    - The confessions connect the Christian life to the Spirit’s ongoing presence and activity.
    - "It is impossible that those who are implanted into Christ by true faith should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 64)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology**, especially in their articulation of the Holy Spirit’s work in **revelation**, **regeneration**, and the life of the church. Their balanced emphasis on both the objective authority of Scripture and the subjective necessity of the Spirit’s illumination remains foundational for confessional Reformed churches worldwide. These documents continue to serve as a touchstone for discussions on the Spirit’s role in **salvation** and the ongoing life of the church.
