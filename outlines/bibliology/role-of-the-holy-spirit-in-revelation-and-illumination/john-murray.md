# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray emphasized the indispensable role of the **Holy Spirit** in both the **objective revelation** of Scripture and the **subjective illumination** of the believer’s mind and heart. He maintained that while **special revelation** is given in the inscripturated Word, only the **regenerating and illuminating work of the Spirit** enables true understanding and saving faith.

- "The Holy Spirit is the author of all revelation and the agent of all illumination." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- The Epistle to the Romans (especially commentary on Romans 8)
- Principles of Conduct
- Redemption Accomplished and Applied
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "The Attestation of Scripture" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Trinitarian and Pneumatological**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the divine agent in the giving of **special revelation**.
    - Revelation is not merely propositional but is personal, rooted in the triune God.
    - The Spirit’s role is inseparable from the Father’s will and the Son’s mediation.
    - The Spirit ensures the reliability and authority of Scripture as God’s Word.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of revelation, and all revelation is mediated by him." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Illumination is Distinct from Inspiration**
    - **Inspiration** refers to the Spirit’s work in producing Scripture; **illumination** refers to the Spirit’s work in readers.
    - The Spirit does not give new revelation but enables understanding of what is revealed.
    - Illumination is necessary due to human sin and spiritual blindness.
    - The Spirit’s illuminating work is sovereign and effectual in the elect.
    - "Illumination is the Holy Spirit’s work in enabling us to understand and appropriate the truth already revealed." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Necessity of Regeneration for True Understanding**
    - Fallen humanity is incapable of rightly receiving revelation apart from the Spirit’s regenerating work.
    - Regeneration precedes and enables spiritual discernment.
    - The Spirit opens the heart to respond to the Word with faith.
    - Saving knowledge is always a fruit of the Spirit’s sovereign grace.
    - "It is only as men are born of the Spirit that they are able to see the kingdom of God." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Objective Sufficiency of Scripture and Subjective Certainty**
    - Scripture is objectively sufficient as the Word of God.
    - The Spirit grants subjective assurance of its truth and authority.
    - The internal testimony of the Spirit is necessary for conviction and certainty.
    - This testimony is not new revelation but a work of persuasion and sealing.
    - "The testimony of the Spirit is the means by which we are assured of the divine origin and authority of Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

5. **Sanctification and Ongoing Illumination**
    - The Spirit’s illuminating work continues throughout the believer’s life.
    - Growth in understanding is tied to sanctification and obedience.
    - The Spirit applies the Word to the heart, convicting, comforting, and guiding.
    - Illumination is both initial and progressive, deepening communion with God.
    - "The Holy Spirit continues to illumine the minds of believers, leading them into all truth." (Principles of Conduct)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of the **Holy Spirit’s role in revelation and illumination** has shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the relationship between Scripture, faith, and the Spirit’s work. His careful distinction between **inspiration** and **illumination** remains influential in discussions of biblical authority and hermeneutics. Murray’s teaching continues to inform pastors and theologians regarding the necessity of the Spirit for both the giving and receiving of divine truth.
