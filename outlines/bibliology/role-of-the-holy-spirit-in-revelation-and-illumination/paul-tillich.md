# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **role of the Holy Spirit** in **revelation** and **illumination** through his method of **correlation**, emphasizing the Spirit as the dynamic presence that mediates the **New Being** and actualizes revelation within existential experience. For Tillich, the Holy Spirit is not a supernatural agent imparting propositional truths, but the power that enables **ultimate concern** and opens individuals to the **depth of reality** where revelation occurs.

- "The Spirit is the presence of God here and now, creating the new reality in the midst of the old." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Event, Not Information**
   - Revelation is not the transmission of doctrinal content but an existential event.
   - The Holy Spirit mediates the encounter with the **New Being** in Christ.
   - Revelation occurs where the finite is grasped by the infinite through the Spirit.
   - The Spirit actualizes revelation within the depths of human existence.
   - "Revelation is the manifestation of the ground of being for human existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Spirit as the Power of New Being**
   - The Holy Spirit is the dynamic force that brings about transformation.
   - Through the Spirit, individuals participate in the **New Creation**.
   - The Spirit is the principle of unity and healing in estranged existence.
   - The Holy Spirit is not a separate agent but the presence of God’s creative and saving power.
   - "The Spirit is the power of the New Being, actualizing itself under the conditions of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Illumination as Existential Awareness**
   - Illumination is the awakening to **ultimate concern** and the depth of reality.
   - The Spirit enables persons to recognize the divine dimension in ordinary experience.
   - Illumination is not intellectual enlightenment but existential transformation.
   - The Spirit opens the human spirit to the presence of the divine ground.
   - "The Spirit gives us the power to see the ultimate in the ordinary." (The Protestant Era)

4. **Correlation of Spirit and Human Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit works in correlation with human openness and existential questions.
   - Revelation and illumination are possible where there is existential receptivity.
   - The Spirit addresses the human condition, not abstract metaphysical problems.
   - The Spirit’s work is discerned in the response of faith to the questions of existence.
   - "The divine Spirit meets the human spirit in the depths of existential concern." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Universal Presence of the Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit is universally present as the ground of all being.
   - The Spirit’s work is not confined to the church or explicit Christian experience.
   - All genuine experiences of truth, beauty, and justice are manifestations of the Spirit.
   - The universality of the Spirit undergirds Tillich’s theology of culture and interreligious openness.
   - "The Spirit is present wherever the New Being is manifest, in church and world alike." (Theology of Culture)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s understanding of the **Holy Spirit** as the dynamic presence of God in existential experience has shaped modern discussions of revelation and illumination, especially in dialogue with existentialism and culture. His method of correlation and emphasis on the Spirit’s universal presence have influenced both liberal and post-liberal theology. While Tillich’s approach departs from traditional doctrines of inspiration, it remains a significant resource for those exploring the intersection of **revelation**, culture, and human subjectivity.
