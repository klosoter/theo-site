# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame emphasizes the indispensable role of the **Holy Spirit** in both **revelation** and **illumination**, asserting that true knowledge of God is impossible apart from the Spirit’s work. He integrates the Spirit’s activity within his **triperspectival** framework, highlighting that the Spirit not only inspires **Scripture** but also enables believers to understand and apply it, bridging the gap between divine communication and human reception.

- "Without the Spirit, the words of Scripture would remain a dead letter to us." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2009)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- "Scripture and the Spirit" in The Collected Shorter Writings of John Frame, Vol. 1

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Trinitarian and Pneumatological**
   - The **Holy Spirit** is the agent who reveals the will of the **Father** through the **Son**.
   - All divine revelation is inherently **Trinitarian**, with the Spirit applying and actualizing God’s Word.
   - The Spirit’s role is not secondary but essential in the process of revelation.
   - Revelation is both objective (given) and subjective (received) through the Spirit’s work.
   - "The Spirit is the divine author who brings the Word to us and makes it real in our experience." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

2. **Inspiration and Authority of Scripture**
   - The Spirit is the source of **inspiration**, ensuring the **inerrancy** and authority of Scripture.
   - Inspiration is not mechanical but involves the Spirit’s sovereign use of human authors.
   - The authority of Scripture is inseparable from the Spirit’s ongoing testimony.
   - The Spirit’s inspiration guarantees that Scripture is the living Word of God.
   - "Scripture is the product of the Spirit’s breath, and so it is the very voice of God." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

3. **Illumination as Essential for Understanding**
   - The Spirit must **illuminate** the minds and hearts of readers for true understanding.
   - Illumination is distinct from inspiration but equally necessary for knowledge of God.
   - Without the Spirit’s work, Scripture remains spiritually veiled and misunderstood.
   - Illumination is both cognitive (understanding) and affective (embracing and obeying).
   - "Illumination is the Spirit’s work of overcoming the effects of sin so that we may know God’s truth." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

4. **Triperspectival Epistemology**
   - Knowledge of God involves **normative** (Scripture), **situational** (creation/history), and **existential** (personal/experiential) perspectives.
   - The Spirit operates in all three perspectives, uniting them in the act of knowing.
   - The Spirit’s illumination is necessary for integrating these perspectives in faithful theology.
   - This approach guards against rationalism and subjectivism by rooting knowledge in the Spirit’s work.
   - "The Spirit brings coherence to our knowledge by uniting the perspectives in Himself." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

5. **The Spirit and the Covenant Community**
   - The Spirit works not only in individuals but also corporately within the **church**.
   - The Spirit’s illumination is mediated through the means of grace, especially the ministry of the Word.
   - The Spirit fosters communal discernment and application of revelation.
   - The church’s confession and understanding are dependent on the Spirit’s ongoing guidance.
   - "The Spirit leads the church into all truth, fulfilling Jesus’ promise to His disciples." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s robust articulation of the **Holy Spirit’s** role in revelation and illumination has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially through his **triperspectival** method. His insistence on the Spirit’s necessity for both the authority and understanding of Scripture has influenced pastors, theologians, and students seeking a holistic doctrine of the Word. Frame’s work continues to challenge the church to depend on the Spirit for both doctrinal fidelity and spiritual vitality.
