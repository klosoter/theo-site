# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. emphasizes the indispensable role of the **Holy Spirit** in both the **revelation** of Scripture and the **illumination** of its meaning to believers. He maintains that the Spirit not only inspired the biblical authors but also works in the hearts of readers to grant understanding and conviction, thus uniting **redemptive history** and personal appropriation of the Word.

- "The work of the Spirit is essential, not only in the giving of revelation but also in its reception and understanding." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- Revelation and Tradition: The Influence of the Apostle Paul on Subsequent Theology (in The Pattern of Sound Doctrine)
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "The Holy Spirit" (in The New Dictionary of Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit’s Role in Inspiration**
    - The Holy Spirit is the divine agent who inspired the biblical authors.
    - Inspiration is both plenary and verbal, ensuring the Scriptures are the very Word of God.
    - The Spirit’s work in inspiration is unique and unrepeatable.
    - This inspiration grounds the authority and trustworthiness of Scripture.
    - "The inspiration of Scripture is a once-for-all act of the Spirit, foundational for the church’s faith." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

2. **Revelation is Redemptive-Historical**
    - The Spirit’s revelatory work unfolds in the context of redemptive history.
    - Revelation culminates in the person and work of Christ, as witnessed by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit bridges the gap between historical events and their significance for the church.
    - The canon is closed because redemptive revelation is complete in Christ.
    - "The Spirit’s revelatory activity is inseparable from the history of redemption." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

3. **Illumination is Essential for Understanding**
    - The Holy Spirit must illumine the minds of readers for true understanding of Scripture.
    - Illumination is distinct from inspiration but equally necessary for saving knowledge.
    - The Spirit overcomes human blindness and resistance to the truth.
    - This work is ongoing in the life of every believer.
    - "Apart from the Spirit’s illumination, the message of Scripture remains veiled." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

4. **Objective Word, Subjective Reception**
    - The authority of Scripture is objective, but its reception is subjectively enabled by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit applies the Word to the hearts of individuals, producing faith and obedience.
    - There is no new revelation, but there is ongoing application and conviction.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures the efficacy of the preached and read Word.
    - "The Spirit brings home the objective Word to the subjective experience of believers." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

5. **Unity of Word and Spirit**
    - The Spirit never works apart from the Word; the two are inseparably joined.
    - Any claim to the Spirit’s leading must be tested by the written Word.
    - The Spirit’s ministry is to glorify Christ as revealed in Scripture.
    - Word and Spirit together build up the church in truth and holiness.
    - "The Spirit and the Word are never in competition but always in concert." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **Holy Spirit’s role in revelation and illumination** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of **redemptive history** and the doctrine of Scripture. His insistence on the inseparability of **Word and Spirit** has provided a robust framework for understanding both the authority of the Bible and the necessity of the Spirit’s ongoing work in the church. Gaffin’s influence is evident in the theological formation of pastors and scholars committed to a confessional Reformed approach.
