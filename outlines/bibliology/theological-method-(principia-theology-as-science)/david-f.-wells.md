# David F. Wells (1939– )

David F. Wells is a leading evangelical theologian whose approach to **theological method** is defined by a strong commitment to the objective **principia** of **revelation** and the necessity of theology as a disciplined **science** grounded in the authority of **Scripture**. He is sharply critical of modern and postmodern trends that undermine the **objectivity** and **transcendence** of theological knowledge, insisting that theology must be rooted in the reality of God’s self-disclosure rather than cultural or subjective constructs.

- "Theology is a science because it has its own object—God as he has revealed himself—and its own principia, or first principles, which are given in revelation." (No Place for Truth)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology’s principia are objective and revealed**
    - Theology is grounded in the **principium cognoscendi** (principle of knowing), which is God’s self-revelation in **Scripture**.
    - The **principium essendi** (principle of being) is the triune God himself, not human experience or culture.
    - Theological method must resist the subjectivism of modernity and postmodernity.
    - Revelation, not reason or tradition, is the ultimate source and norm for theology.
    "The principia of theology are not discovered by us but are given to us in revelation." (No Place for Truth)

2. **Theology as a science with a distinct object**
    - Theology is a **science** because it studies God as he has revealed himself, not as a projection of human thought.
    - The discipline has its own methods, norms, and boundaries, distinct from other sciences.
    - Theological knowledge is possible because God has made himself known in history and **Scripture**.
    - The objectivity of theology is rooted in the reality of God’s existence and disclosure.
    "Theology is a science because its object is not constructed by the theologian but given by God." (God in the Wasteland)

3. **Scripture as the normative authority**
    - **Scripture** is the final and sufficient authority for all theological reflection.
    - Theological method must be exegetical, drawing its content and norms from the biblical text.
    - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture safeguard theology from cultural accommodation.
    - All theological claims must be tested against the witness of Scripture.
    "The authority of theology stands or falls with the authority of Scripture." (No Place for Truth)

4. **The necessity of doctrinal and confessional boundaries**
    - Wells insists on the importance of **doctrine** for the health and identity of the church.
    - Confessional standards provide necessary boundaries for theological inquiry.
    - Theological method must be accountable to the historic faith of the church.
    - Doctrinal clarity is essential for resisting the relativism of contemporary culture.
    "Without doctrinal boundaries, theology loses its identity and purpose." (God in the Wasteland)

5. **Engagement with culture from a position of transcendence**
    - Theology must engage culture, but from the standpoint of God’s **transcendent** truth.
    - Theological method must avoid capitulating to cultural trends or ideologies.
    - The church’s witness depends on maintaining the distinction between divine revelation and human opinion.
    - Wells warns against the loss of transcendence in both theology and church practice.
    "When transcendence is lost, theology becomes little more than anthropology." (Above All Earthly Pow’rs)

## Legacy and Impact

David F. Wells has played a significant role in calling evangelicalism back to a robust **doctrine of revelation** and a disciplined theological method. His critique of cultural accommodation and insistence on the **objectivity** of theology have shaped contemporary discussions on the nature and task of theology, especially within Reformed and evangelical circles. Wells’s work continues to challenge theologians to uphold the primacy of **Scripture** and the necessity of doctrinal boundaries in a rapidly changing world.
