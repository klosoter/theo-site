# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s theological method is grounded in the conviction that **theology is a true science** rooted in **divine revelation** and governed by the **principia** of **Scripture** and the **Holy Spirit**. He insists that all knowledge of God must begin with God’s self-disclosure, and that the task of theology is to systematize this knowledge with humility and reverence, always subject to the authority of the **Word of God**.

- "For by his Word, God rendered faith unambiguous forever, a faith that should be superior to all opinion." (Institutes, 1.7.2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Primary Principium**
    - Scripture is the foundational **principium cognoscendi** (principle of knowing) for all theology.
    - The authority of Scripture is self-authenticating and does not rest on the church or tradition.
    - All theological claims must be tested by the clear teaching of the Bible.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are essential for theological certainty.
    - "The Word will not find acceptance in men's hearts before it is sealed by the inward testimony of the Spirit." (Institutes, 1.7.4)

2. **The Holy Spirit as Internal Witness**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the **principium essendi** (principle of being) that enables true knowledge of God.
    - Faith arises not from human reason but from the Spirit’s inward work.
    - The Spirit illumines the mind to recognize Scripture’s divine origin.
    - Assurance of truth is grounded in the Spirit’s testimony, not external proofs.
    - "The testimony of the Spirit is more excellent than all reason." (Institutes, 1.7.4)

3. **Theology as a True Science**
    - Theology is a **scientia** because it is based on objective, divinely given principles.
    - Theological method involves logical ordering of revealed truths, not speculation.
    - The certainty of theology surpasses that of other sciences due to its divine source.
    - The theologian’s task is to humbly receive and faithfully expound what God has revealed.
    - "The knowledge of God, as far as our mind is capable, is set forth in the Scriptures." (Institutes, 1.10.2)

4. **Humility and Reverence in Theological Inquiry**
    - Human reason is limited and must be subject to God’s revelation.
    - Speculation beyond Scripture is to be avoided; mystery is to be honored.
    - Theological method requires prayerful dependence on God.
    - True wisdom consists in knowing God and ourselves rightly.
    - "Let us not take it into our heads either to seek out God anywhere else than in his Sacred Word, or to think anything about him that is not prompted by his Word." (Institutes, 1.13.21)

5. **Integration of Exegesis and Systematics**
    - Exegetical study of Scripture is foundational for all doctrinal formulation.
    - Systematic theology must arise from and be accountable to the biblical text.
    - There is a dynamic interplay between biblical exposition and doctrinal synthesis.
    - The unity of Scripture ensures coherence in theological construction.
    - "We must not take our doctrine from anywhere else than from the pure Word of God." (Commentary on Galatians)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s approach to **theological method** profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the primacy of **Scripture** and the necessity of the **Spirit’s illumination**. His insistence on theology as a true science grounded in divine revelation provided a model for later Protestant orthodoxy. Calvin’s balance of exegetical rigor and systematic clarity continues to influence contemporary discussions on the nature and task of theology. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to the authority and sufficiency of the Word of God.
