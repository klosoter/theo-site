# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated a robust **theological method** grounded in the **principia** of **Reformed dogmatics**, emphasizing **theology as a science** with its own objective foundation and method. He distinguished between the **principium cognoscendi** (principle of knowledge) and **principium essendi** (principle of being), insisting that **Scripture** is the unique source and norm for theological knowledge, and that theology is a disciplined, organic science rooted in divine revelation.

- "Dogmatics is the systematic exposition of the truths of Scripture, in their organic connection." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Science of Theology" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)
- "The Doctrine of Revelation in the History of Dogmatics" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science**
   - Theology possesses a distinct scientific character, with its own subject matter and method.
   - It is systematic, seeking the organic unity of revealed truth.
   - Theological science is not autonomous, but dependent on divine revelation.
   - The discipline is both theoretical (contemplative) and practical (serving the church).
   - "Theology is a science because it arranges the facts of revelation into a systematic whole." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Principia: Dual Foundations**
   - The **principium essendi** is God Himself, the ultimate ground of theology.
   - The **principium cognoscendi** is **Holy Scripture**, the external principle of knowledge.
   - These principia ensure that theology is both objectively grounded and epistemologically secure.
   - The principia are not constructed by human reason but are given by God.
   - "The principium essendi is God; the principium cognoscendi externum is Scripture." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Revelation as the Basis of Theology**
   - Theology depends entirely on **special revelation** for its content and method.
   - Natural theology is subordinate and insufficient for true knowledge of God.
   - Revelation is both propositional (Scripture) and historical (redemptive acts).
   - The unity of revelation is essential for the coherence of theology as a science.
   - "Revelation is the principle of knowledge for theology, not reason or experience." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

4. **Organic Unity of Dogmatics**
   - The truths of Scripture form an organic, interconnected whole.
   - Dogmatics must reflect the unity and diversity of biblical revelation.
   - Theological loci are not isolated, but mutually interpretive.
   - The organic structure mirrors the unity of God’s redemptive work.
   - "Dogmatics is the systematization of the organic unity of revealed truth." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

5. **Distinction and Relationship of Biblical and Systematic Theology**
   - **Biblical theology** traces the progressive unfolding of revelation in history.
   - **Systematic theology** arranges revealed truths in their logical and doctrinal connections.
   - Both disciplines are scientific, but differ in method and focus.
   - The two are complementary, not opposed, serving the unity of theological science.
   - "Biblical Theology and Dogmatics are not rivals, but allies in the service of the truth." ("The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science")

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **theological method** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in its understanding of **principia** and the scientific character of theology. His distinction between **biblical** and **systematic theology** has become foundational for modern theological curricula. Vos’s insistence on the organic unity of revelation and the primacy of Scripture as the principium cognoscendi continues to influence confessional Reformed scholarship and the practice of theology as a disciplined science.
