# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline advanced a distinctive **theological method** rooted in the **Reformed principia** tradition, emphasizing **Scripture** as the foundational **principium cognoscendi** and the **covenant** as the organizing structure of revelation. He viewed **theology as a science** grounded in divine self-disclosure, with a methodological focus on the **biblical-theological** unfolding of redemptive history and the analogical relationship between **Creator and creature**.

- "Theology is a science because it is a systematic exposition of the revelation of God, whose Word is the principium of all true knowledge." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Principium Cognoscendi**
    - Scripture is the ultimate source and norm for all theological knowledge.
    - The authority of Scripture is self-authenticating and foundational for theology.
    - Human reason is subordinate to the divine revelation given in Scripture.
    - The principia of theology are not philosophical axioms but the triune God’s self-revelation.
    - "The Bible is the Word of the covenant Lord, the canon of the covenant community." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

2. **Covenant as Organizing Principle**
    - The covenant structure undergirds both the form and content of revelation.
    - All theological loci are interpreted through the lens of covenantal administration.
    - The covenant provides the framework for understanding God’s relationship with humanity.
    - The historical unfolding of covenants guides the method and content of theology.
    - "Covenant is the architectonic principle of biblical revelation." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Theology as a Science of Divine Revelation**
    - Theology is a disciplined, systematic study of God’s self-revelation.
    - The scientific character of theology derives from its principled method and objectivity.
    - Theological method involves exegesis, synthesis, and application of biblical data.
    - The analogical nature of knowledge ensures that theology is both rigorous and humble.
    - "Theology is a science because it is a systematic exposition of the revelation of God." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

4. **Biblical-Theological Method**
    - Emphasizes the progressive, historical unfolding of revelation.
    - Prioritizes redemptive-historical context over abstract systematics.
    - Seeks to trace typological patterns and covenantal developments.
    - Integrates exegesis with theological synthesis, avoiding speculative philosophy.
    - "Biblical theology traces the unfolding of God’s covenantal revelation in history." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Creator-Creature Distinction and Analogy**
    - Maintains a clear ontological distinction between God and humanity.
    - Human knowledge of God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - Theological method respects the limits of creaturely understanding.
    - All theological assertions are subject to the Creator’s sovereign self-disclosure.
    - "Our knowledge is a finite replica of the archetypal knowledge of God." (Images of the Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s methodological contributions reinforced the **Reformed principia** tradition while innovatively applying the **covenant** as a central organizing motif for theology. His emphasis on the **biblical-theological method** has shaped generations of Reformed scholars, particularly in the interpretation of redemptive history and the structure of revelation. Kline’s rigorous approach to **theology as a science** continues to influence debates on theological method, hermeneutics, and the doctrine of Scripture within confessional Reformed circles.
