# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a **theological method** grounded in the conviction that **theology is a science**, with **Scripture** as its principium cognoscendi (principle of knowledge). He emphasized the collection, classification, and systematic arrangement of biblical facts, insisting that theology proceeds analogously to the **inductive sciences** and is governed by the **analogy of faith**.

- "The Bible is to the theologian what nature is to the man of science." (Systematic Theology, I.10)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- "The Science of Theology" (Princeton Review, 1857)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Princeton Theologians: A Reappraisal (secondary, Mark Noll, ed.)
- The Way of Life

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science**
    - Theology is a systematic discipline, analogous to the natural sciences.
    - It collects facts from **Scripture** and arranges them according to their relations.
    - The theologian’s task is to classify and systematize biblical data.
    - The certainty of theology rests on the certainty of its sources.
    - "Theology is the science of the facts of divine revelation, so far as those facts concern the nature of God and our relation to Him." (Systematic Theology, I.1)

2. **Scripture as Principium Cognoscendi**
    - The Bible is the sole and infallible source of theological knowledge.
    - All doctrines must be derived from the explicit or implicit teaching of Scripture.
    - The authority of theology is derivative from the authority of Scripture.
    - Tradition and reason serve only ministerially, not magisterially.
    - "The Bible is the storehouse of facts; the theologian is to collect, authenticate, arrange, and exhibit them." (Systematic Theology, I.10)

3. **Use of Inductive Method**
    - Theology employs an inductive approach, gathering data before forming doctrines.
    - Doctrines are not imposed on Scripture but emerge from its comprehensive witness.
    - The method guards against speculative or rationalistic systems.
    - The analogy of faith guides the harmonization of scriptural teaching.
    - "The method of theology is the same as that of natural science; it consists in the collection and orderly arrangement of facts." (Systematic Theology, I.10)

4. **Role of Reason and Experience**
    - Reason is a tool for understanding, not a source of revelation.
    - Experience confirms but does not generate doctrine.
    - Reason discerns the meaning of Scripture but does not judge its truth.
    - The limits of reason are acknowledged in matters of divine mystery.
    - "Reason must be subject to the Scriptures, not the Scriptures to reason." (Systematic Theology, I.53)

5. **Analogy of Faith**
    - Scripture interprets Scripture; no doctrine may contradict the whole.
    - The unity and coherence of biblical teaching are foundational.
    - Apparent contradictions are resolved by the totality of revelation.
    - The analogy of faith protects against doctrinal novelty and error.
    - "No doctrine, therefore, can be admitted as part of the faith of the Church, which is not taught in Scripture, understood in accordance with the analogy of faith." (Systematic Theology, I.13)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s **scientific approach to theology** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially at Princeton Seminary. His emphasis on **Scripture as the principium** and the use of the **inductive method** became hallmarks of American Presbyterian orthodoxy. While later theologians critiqued his method as overly rationalistic, Hodge’s influence endures in debates over the nature and method of systematic theology. His legacy remains central to discussions of **theological prolegomena** in the Reformed tradition.
