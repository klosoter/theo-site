# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **theological method** with a strong emphasis on the **self-revelation of God** as the foundation for theology, rejecting any autonomous rationalism. He viewed **theology as a science** grounded in **Scripture** as its principium cognoscendi, while also recognizing the importance of **faith** and the **work of the Holy Spirit** in the apprehension of divine truth. Berkouwer’s method was marked by a critical engagement with both the **Reformed tradition** and contemporary theological developments.

- "Dogmatics is concerned with the truth of faith, and this truth is not a product of human speculation, but is given in the revelation of God." (Faith and Revelation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Principium Cognoscendi**
    - Theology begins with God’s **self-revelation** in Scripture, not human reason.
    - The **Word of God** is the source and norm for all theological reflection.
    - Revelation is personal and historical, not abstract or speculative.
    - The authority of Scripture is inseparable from the act of revelation itself.
    - "Theology is possible only because God has spoken." (Holy Scripture)

2. **Theology as a Science of Faith**
    - Theology is a **scientia fidei**: a disciplined, rational inquiry rooted in faith.
    - Theological method requires humility before the mystery of God’s self-disclosure.
    - Faith is not opposed to reason, but reason is always subordinate to revelation.
    - The community of faith is essential for the proper exercise of theology.
    - "Theology is not a neutral science; it is a believing reflection on the Word." (Faith and Revelation)

3. **Critical Engagement with Tradition**
    - Berkouwer valued the **Reformed confessions** but refused to absolutize them.
    - He advocated for a continual re-examination of tradition in light of Scripture.
    - Tradition serves as a guide, not a final authority, in theological method.
    - Theological development is necessary as the church faces new questions.
    - "Dogmatics must always be reforming, always returning to the source." (A Half Century of Theology)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Theological Understanding**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables true understanding of revelation.
    - Illumination is necessary for both the theologian and the church.
    - The Spirit’s work guards against both rationalism and subjectivism.
    - The Spirit unites the church in the confession of the truth.
    - "Without the Spirit, the letter of Scripture remains closed." (Holy Scripture)

5. **Openness to Dialogue and Contemporary Issues**
    - Berkouwer engaged with modern philosophy and theology without compromise.
    - He encouraged dialogue with other traditions to clarify and deepen Reformed convictions.
    - Theological method must address contemporary questions faithfully.
    - Openness to correction is a mark of genuine theological science.
    - "Theology must listen, not only to the past, but also to the present." (A Half Century of Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s approach to **theological method** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians, particularly through his insistence on the primacy of **revelation** and the dynamic, ongoing task of theology. His nuanced engagement with both tradition and contemporary thought fostered a spirit of critical faithfulness within the Reformed community. Berkouwer’s legacy endures in the ongoing conversation about the nature of **theology as a science** grounded in the living Word of God.
