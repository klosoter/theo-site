# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper advanced a distinctive **theological method** rooted in the **Reformed principia** tradition, emphasizing the necessity of **regeneration** and the **self-attesting authority of Scripture** for true theological knowledge. He understood **theology as a science** with its own principia, distinct from other sciences, and insisted that only those renewed by the Holy Spirit can rightly apprehend divine truth.

- "Theology is a science, because it proceeds from fixed principles, follows a fixed method, and arrives at a fixed result." ("Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science with Distinct Principia**
   - Theology possesses its own **principia cognoscendi** (principle of knowledge) and **principia essendi** (principle of being).
   - The principium cognoscendi is **Holy Scripture**, which is self-authenticating.
   - The principium essendi is **God Himself**, the source and object of theology.
   - Theology is not derivative from philosophy or natural sciences but stands on its own foundation.
   - "Theology is a science, because it has its own principle, its own method, and its own object." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Necessity of Regeneration for Theological Knowledge**
   - Only the **regenerate** can truly know God and understand theology.
   - The **noetic effects of sin** render the unregenerate incapable of rightly apprehending divine truth.
   - The Holy Spirit illumines the mind, enabling proper reception of revelation.
   - This creates an antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought.
   - "Without regeneration, no theology is possible." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

3. **Scripture as Self-Attesting and Foundational**
   - **Scripture** is the ultimate authority and the principium cognoscendi externum.
   - Its authority is not dependent on external validation or rational proof.
   - The self-attestation of Scripture is confirmed by the internal witness of the Holy Spirit.
   - All theological reasoning must begin and end with the Word of God.
   - "The Holy Scripture is the foundation of all theological science." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

4. **Antithesis and the Twofold Science**
   - There is a fundamental **antithesis** between those who operate from the principia of regeneration and those who do not.
   - This leads to two kinds of science: one rooted in faith, the other in unbelief.
   - Theological method must recognize this divide and not seek a neutral standpoint.
   - Kuyper rejects the Enlightenment ideal of religiously neutral scholarship.
   - "There is no neutral science; all science is determined by the starting point of the investigator." (Lectures on Calvinism)

5. **Sphere Sovereignty and the Autonomy of Theology**
   - Each sphere of life, including theology, has its own God-given laws and principles.
   - Theology must not be subordinated to philosophy, science, or state.
   - The autonomy of theology safeguards its integrity as a science.
   - This principle undergirds Kuyper’s broader vision of **sphere sovereignty** in society.
   - "Every science has its own domain, its own method, and its own principle." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust articulation of **theological method** profoundly shaped the Neo-Calvinist tradition and influenced Reformed approaches to **epistemology** and **theology as science**. His insistence on the antithesis and the necessity of regeneration for true knowledge continues to inform debates on the relationship between faith and reason. Kuyper’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of Reformed principia doctrine and in the global expansion of Neo-Calvinist thought, especially regarding the autonomy and integrity of theology within the academy.
