# Michael Allen (1979– )

Michael Allen articulates a **theological method** that is deeply rooted in the classical **Reformed principia** tradition, emphasizing **theology as a science** grounded in **divine revelation** and ordered by **Scripture**. He insists that theology is a disciplined, ecclesial practice oriented by **God’s self-communication**, and that its scientific character is defined by its principial sources and ends.

- "Christian theology is a science because it takes its principles from God’s own self-revelation, not from autonomous human reason." (Reformed Catholicity, p. 17)

## Key Works

- Reformed Catholicity: The Promise of Retrieval for Theology and Biblical Interpretation (with Scott R. Swain)
- Theological Commentary: Evangelical Perspectives (editor)
- Grounded in Heaven: Recentering Christian Hope and Life on God
- Sanctification (New Studies in Dogmatics)
- "Knowledge of God: Protestant Perspectives" (in The Oxford Handbook of the Epistemology of Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Principia Theologiae: Theology’s Foundational Principles**
    - Affirms that **theology’s principia** are God (as principium essendi) and Scripture (as principium cognoscendi).
    - Insists that theology’s foundation is **divine revelation**, not human speculation.
    - Draws on the **Reformed scholastic** tradition to clarify theology’s principial structure.
    - Maintains that theology’s method is shaped by its principia, ensuring its **scientific character**.
    - "Theology is scientific precisely because it is principially ordered by God’s self-giving in Christ and Scripture." (Reformed Catholicity, p. 19)

2. **Theology as a Science: Ordered and Ecclesial**
    - Argues that theology is a **science** in the classical sense: a disciplined, ordered knowledge.
    - Rejects modern reductions of science to empirical or autonomous rationality.
    - Emphasizes the **ecclesial context** of theological reasoning and inquiry.
    - Sees theology’s scientific status as derived from its principia, not from methodological neutrality.
    - "Theology’s scientific status is not a matter of method alone, but of principial orientation to God’s revelation." (Reformed Catholicity, p. 22)

3. **Scripture as Norming Norm**
    - Holds that **Scripture** is the **norma normans** (norming norm) for all theological claims.
    - Affirms the sufficiency, clarity, and authority of Scripture for theological method.
    - Insists that all theological reasoning must be **regulated by the biblical canon**.
    - Advocates for retrieval of **patristic and Reformed approaches** to Scripture’s role in theology.
    - "Theology must ever be normed by the canon, not by ecclesial tradition or philosophical speculation." (Reformed Catholicity, p. 45)

4. **Retrieval for Contemporary Theology**
    - Champions **retrieval** of classical Christian sources for contemporary theological method.
    - Argues that modern theology benefits from ressourcement, especially of **Reformed scholasticism**.
    - Sees retrieval as a means to deepen theology’s scientific and ecclesial character.
    - Encourages engagement with the broader **catholic tradition** for methodological renewal.
    - "Retrieval is not nostalgia but a disciplined return to the sources that shape theology’s principia." (Reformed Catholicity, p. 10)

5. **Dogmatics as Churchly Science**
    - Defines **dogmatics** as a churchly science, serving the church’s confession and witness.
    - Stresses the communal and doxological orientation of theological method.
    - Insists that dogmatics is accountable to both **Scripture and the church’s tradition**.
    - Sees the task of dogmatics as clarifying and articulating the faith in light of its principia.
    - "Dogmatics is a churchly science, ordered by God’s Word and for the church’s life." (Sanctification, p. 29)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Allen has played a significant role in the contemporary retrieval of **Reformed catholicity** and the principial structure of theology. His work has helped reframe discussions of **theological method** by emphasizing the scientific, ecclesial, and principial dimensions of dogmatics. Allen’s influence is evident in renewed interest in classical sources and in the ongoing conversation about theology’s nature as a science within the Reformed tradition.
