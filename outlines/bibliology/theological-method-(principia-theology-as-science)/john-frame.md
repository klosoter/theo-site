# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame’s approach to **theological method** is marked by his emphasis on the **lordship of God**, the **multiperspectival** nature of knowledge, and the conviction that **theology is a science** grounded in **Scripture as principium cognoscendi**. He rejects a strict separation between theology and other disciplines, arguing that all knowledge is unified under God’s authority and that theology is both **normative** and **practical**. Frame’s method is shaped by his commitment to **presuppositionalism** and the necessity of **divine revelation** as the foundation for all theological reasoning.

- "Theology is the application of the Word of God by persons to all areas of life." ("The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought (1995)
- "Presuppositional Apologetics" in Five Views on Apologetics (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Multiperspectivalism in Theological Method**
    - Knowledge is best understood through the **normative**, **situational**, and **existential** perspectives.
    - No single perspective is sufficient; all are necessary for a full understanding of truth.
    - Theological method must account for the complexity of human experience and divine revelation.
    - Multiperspectivalism is rooted in the **Trinitarian** nature of God.
    - "We need all three perspectives to understand any subject adequately." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

2. **Scripture as the Principium Cognoscendi**
    - **Scripture** is the ultimate source and standard for theological knowledge.
    - All theological claims must be tested by the authority of the Bible.
    - The **self-attesting** nature of Scripture is central to its role as principium.
    - Human reason and experience are subordinate to the Word of God.
    - "Scripture is the supremely authoritative norm for all human thought and life." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

3. **Theology as Application of God’s Word**
    - Theology is not merely speculative but is the practical application of divine revelation.
    - Theological method involves obedience and transformation, not just intellectual assent.
    - The goal of theology is to shape the life and practice of the church.
    - Theological science is inseparable from Christian living and worship.
    - "Theology is the application of the Word of God by persons to all areas of life." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

4. **Presuppositional Foundation of Theology**
    - All reasoning is based on **presuppositions** that are ultimately religious in nature.
    - Christian theology must begin with the presupposition of God’s existence and revelation.
    - Neutrality in theological method is impossible; all thought is covenantally committed.
    - The **lordship of Christ** governs every aspect of theological inquiry.
    - "There is no neutrality; everyone has ultimate commitments." (Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought)

5. **Theology as Science under Divine Lordship**
    - Theology is a true **science** because it seeks knowledge of God’s world under God’s authority.
    - Theological method is rigorous, systematic, and accountable to divine revelation.
    - The **lordship attributes** (authority, control, presence) shape the nature of theological science.
    - The unity of truth is found in submission to God’s comprehensive sovereignty.
    - "Theology is a science, but it is a science under the lordship of God." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s **multiperspectivalism** has significantly influenced contemporary Reformed theology, especially in the areas of epistemology and theological method. His insistence on the practical and applicatory nature of theology has shaped pastoral training and the practice of theology in the church. By building on and modifying **Van Til’s presuppositionalism**, Frame has provided a robust framework for understanding theology as a unified, God-centered discipline. His work continues to provoke discussion about the nature of **theological science** and the centrality of Scripture in all theological reflection.
