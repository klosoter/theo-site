# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s approach to **theological method** centers on the primacy of **Scripture** as the sole and sufficient **principium cognoscendi** for theology, rejecting the medieval synthesis of **reason** and **revelation**. He insists that **theology is a science** only insofar as it is grounded in the self-authenticating Word of God, and he opposes the scholastic reliance on **natural theology** or autonomous philosophical principles.

- "The true rule is this: God’s Word shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel can do so." (Smalcald Articles)

## Key Works

- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Disputation Against Scholastic Theology (1517)
- Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans (1522)
- Heidelberg Disputation (1518)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole Principium**
    - Scripture alone is the foundation and norm of all theological knowledge.
    - Rejects the authority of church tradition or councils as equal to Scripture.
    - Insists that Scripture is clear and self-interpreting in matters of salvation.
    - The Holy Spirit works through the Word to illumine understanding.
    - "The Word of God shall establish articles of faith, and no one else." (Smalcald Articles)

2. **Theology as a Science of Faith**
    - Theology is not a speculative or philosophical discipline but arises from faith in God’s revelation.
    - True knowledge of God is inseparable from trust in His promises.
    - Theologia crucis (theology of the cross) contrasts with human wisdom and speculation.
    - Faith, not reason, is the proper organ for theological understanding.
    - "Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has." (Table Talk)

3. **Rejection of Scholastic Method**
    - Opposes the use of Aristotelian categories as foundational for theology.
    - Critiques the synthesis of philosophy and theology in medieval scholasticism.
    - Argues that human reason is corrupted by sin and unreliable as a theological starting point.
    - Emphasizes the distinction between the hidden and revealed God.
    - "No one can become a theologian unless he becomes one without Aristotle." (Disputation Against Scholastic Theology)

4. **Theologia Crucis (Theology of the Cross)**
    - True theology centers on God’s self-revelation in the cross of Christ.
    - Human wisdom and glory are subverted by the suffering and humility of Christ.
    - The cross exposes the inadequacy of human reason and religious achievement.
    - The theologian of the cross calls a thing what it actually is, not what it appears to be.
    - "He deserves to be called a theologian... who comprehends the visible and manifest things of God seen through suffering and the cross." (Heidelberg Disputation)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Theological Knowledge**
    - The Spirit alone enables right understanding of Scripture.
    - The external Word is necessary, but internal illumination is the Spirit’s work.
    - The church is the creature of the Word, not its judge.
    - Assurance of truth comes from the Spirit’s testimony, not ecclesiastical authority.
    - "No one can understand the Word of God, whether it be spoken or written, unless he is enlightened by the Holy Spirit." (Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s insistence on **sola Scriptura** as the principium of theology profoundly reshaped the nature of **systematic theology** in the Protestant tradition. By rejecting the medieval synthesis of faith and reason, he set the stage for later Reformed and Lutheran approaches to **theological method**. His emphasis on the **theology of the cross** and the necessity of the Holy Spirit’s illumination continues to influence contemporary discussions on the nature and task of theology. Luther’s legacy endures in the ongoing Protestant commitment to the primacy of Scripture and the critique of autonomous reason in theological science.
