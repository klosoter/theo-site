# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann’s approach to **theological method** is marked by a radical rethinking of **revelation**, **faith**, and the nature of **theology as science**. He famously insisted on the necessity of **demythologization**, arguing that theology must interpret the **kerygma** existentially, rather than relying on outdated metaphysical frameworks. For Bultmann, the **principia** of theology are not objective, external authorities but are found in the existential encounter with the proclaimed Word.

- "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (in Kerygma and Myth)
- Theology of the New Testament
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- Faith and Understanding
- Existence and Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization as Method**
    - Theology must reinterpret biblical myths to uncover their existential meaning.
    - The mythological worldview of the New Testament is incompatible with modern scientific understanding.
    - Demythologization seeks to make the **kerygma** intelligible to contemporary people.
    - The task is not to eliminate myth, but to interpret it existentially.
    - "What is demanded is not the elimination of mythological statements but their interpretation." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Revelation**
    - Revelation is not propositional but occurs in the existential encounter with the Word.
    - Theological truth is accessed through personal decision and faith, not objective demonstration.
    - The Bible’s authority lies in its power to confront the individual with the demand for authentic existence.
    - The **principia** of theology are grounded in existential experience, not external authorities.
    - "Faith is the surrender of the self, the readiness to let oneself be called into question by God." (Faith and Understanding)

3. **Theology as Science (Wissenschaft)**
    - Theology must be conducted with the same critical rigor as other sciences.
    - It is a historical and hermeneutical discipline, not a speculative or metaphysical one.
    - Theological statements are subject to historical criticism and existential interpretation.
    - The scientific character of theology lies in its method, not in its subject matter.
    - "Theology is a science in so far as it is a methodical inquiry into the content of faith." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Rejection of Objective Metaphysics**
    - Traditional metaphysical systems are inadequate for expressing Christian faith.
    - Theological language is symbolic and points beyond itself to existential realities.
    - Objective proofs of God or doctrine are impossible and unnecessary.
    - Faith is a personal, existential response, not assent to metaphysical propositions.
    - "We cannot use the language of objectifying thought to speak of God." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation (kerygma) is the heart of Christian faith and theology.
    - The kerygma confronts the hearer with the call to authentic existence.
    - Theological method must focus on interpreting and communicating the kerygma in contemporary terms.
    - The kerygma is not a set of doctrines but an existential event.
    - "The real content of the New Testament is the kerygma, the proclamation of the event of Christ." (Kerygma and Myth)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s **demythologization** project profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **hermeneutics** and existential interpretation. His insistence on the existential encounter as the locus of revelation challenged traditional views of **theological method** and the nature of **theology as science**. While controversial, his work forced theologians to grapple with the relationship between faith, history, and modernity, leaving a lasting mark on both Protestant theology and biblical studies.
