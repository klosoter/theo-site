# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck developed a robust account of **theological method** rooted in the Reformed tradition, emphasizing **principia** (foundational principles) and the scientific character of **dogmatics**. He distinguished between the **principium cognoscendi** (the principle of knowing, i.e., Scripture) and the **principium essendi** (the principle of being, i.e., God), arguing that theology is a true **science** because it proceeds from divinely given foundations and follows a coherent, organic structure.

- "Dogmatics is the science that systematically presents the knowledge of God as he has revealed himself in his Word." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.29)

- Philosophy of Revelation
- "The Science of Sacred Theology" (essay in Essays on Religion, Science, and Society)
- Our Reasonable Faith
- Herman Bavinck: On Theology (ed. John Bolt)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science**
    - Theology possesses a distinct object: the **self-revelation of God** in Scripture.
    - It employs a method that is both **scientific** and **spiritual**, integrating faith and reason.
    - Theological science is systematic, seeking coherence and unity in doctrine.
    - Its certainty is grounded in **divine revelation**, not autonomous human reason.
    - "Theology is a science, not because it is based on human reason, but because it is grounded in divine revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.52)

2. **Principia: Dual Foundations**
    - The **principium essendi** is God himself, the source and foundation of all theology.
    - The **principium cognoscendi externum** is **Holy Scripture**, the external means by which God is known.
    - The **principium cognoscendi internum** is **faith** worked by the Holy Spirit.
    - These principia ensure theology’s objectivity and dependence on revelation.
    - "The principium essendi is God; the principium cognoscendi is revelation, especially as it is contained in Holy Scripture." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.209)

3. **Organic and Coherent Method**
    - Theology reflects the organic unity of **revelation** and the interconnectedness of doctrines.
    - Doctrines are not isolated but form a living, coherent whole.
    - The method is not merely deductive or inductive, but **organic**, respecting the structure of revelation.
    - This approach guards against rationalism and fragmentation in theology.
    - "Dogmatics must be organic, not mechanical, in its structure and development." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.95)

4. **Role of Faith and the Church**
    - True theology is possible only within the context of **faith**.
    - The **church** is the primary context in which theology is practiced and transmitted.
    - Faith is both the presupposition and the fruit of theological study.
    - Theological method is ecclesial, not merely individual or academic.
    - "Faith is the foundation and starting point of theology." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.67)

5. **Integration of Philosophy and Revelation**
    - Philosophy serves theology by clarifying concepts and defending the faith, but is subordinate to revelation.
    - Bavinck affirms the use of reason, but insists it must be renewed by **regeneration**.
    - Theological method critically appropriates philosophical insights without compromising **Scripture’s authority**.
    - There is a necessary distinction and harmony between **general** and **special revelation**.
    - "Philosophy and theology each have their own principia, but theology is always normed by revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.616)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s articulation of **theological method** has profoundly shaped modern Reformed dogmatics, especially through his careful treatment of **principia** and the scientific status of theology. His organic and principial approach continues to influence contemporary discussions on the nature of **systematic theology** and its relationship to philosophy and the church. Bavinck’s legacy endures in both academic and ecclesial contexts, providing a model for integrating faith, reason, and revelation in theological scholarship.
