# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg’s approach to **theological method** is marked by his insistence that **theology is a science** grounded in **publicly accessible truth** and oriented toward the **principia** of revelation and reason. He rejects fideism, arguing that **theological claims** must be subject to rational scrutiny and historical investigation, with **revelation** understood as an event open to all rather than a private experience.

- "Theology must justify its statements in the context of the general search for truth." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

## Key Works

- Theology and the Philosophy of Science (1976)
- Systematic Theology (3 vols., 1988–1993)
- Revelation as History (1968, ed. with R. H. Fuller)
- Basic Questions in Theology (3 vols., 1970–1973)
- Jesus—God and Man (1968)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science Among Sciences**
   - Theology must engage in **critical, rational discourse** alongside other academic disciplines.
   - Theological statements are subject to **verification and falsification** in the public sphere.
   - Rejects the notion of a separate, faith-based epistemology for theology.
   - Seeks to ground theology in **universal truth claims** accessible to all.
   - "Theology must take its place among the sciences, not as a privileged discipline, but as one that seeks truth in the same public way." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

2. **Revelation as Historical Event**
   - Revelation is not a private or mystical experience but occurs in **public history**.
   - The **resurrection of Jesus** is the central, open event in which God’s self-disclosure is accessible.
   - Revelation is subject to **historical investigation** and critique.
   - Theological method must integrate **historical-critical analysis**.
   - "Revelation is not a supernatural communication but the event of history itself." (Revelation as History)

3. **Principia: Reason and Revelation**
   - Theology’s principia are both **reason** (as a universal human faculty) and **revelation** (as God’s self-disclosure in history).
   - There is no strict separation between faith and reason; both are necessary for theological knowledge.
   - Theological method involves **dialogue with philosophy and science**.
   - The **objectivity** of theology depends on its principia being accessible to all rational inquiry.
   - "Faith and reason are not opposed but are mutually dependent in the search for truth." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Provisionality and Eschatological Verification**
   - All theological knowledge is **provisional**, awaiting final confirmation at the **eschaton**.
   - The **future** is the horizon in which the truth of theological claims will be fully revealed.
   - Theological assertions are open to revision in light of new understanding or evidence.
   - This eschatological openness guards against dogmatic closure.
   - "The truth of Christian doctrine is open to the future and awaits its final vindication." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Universality and Publicness of Truth**
   - Theological claims must be **universally valid**, not restricted to the church or the believer.
   - Theology is accountable to the **public realm** and must engage in dialogue with secular thought.
   - The **public nature of revelation** means theology cannot retreat into private or subjective claims.
   - Theological method is committed to **rational persuasion** and open argument.
   - "Christian truth claims must be presented as universally valid, not merely as confessional assertions." (Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s insistence on **theology as a public, rational discipline** has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of theological method, especially in dialogue with philosophy and science. His emphasis on the **historicity of revelation** and the **universality of theological claims** challenged both neo-orthodox and liberal paradigms. Pannenberg’s work continues to influence debates on the relationship between **faith and reason**, and his vision of theology as a science remains a significant reference point in systematic theology.
