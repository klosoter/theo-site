# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a rigorous **theological method** that treats **theology as a science** grounded in **principia**—fundamental principles revealed by God and apprehended by faith. He distinguished between **natural reason** and **sacred doctrine**, arguing that while theology employs philosophical tools, its ultimate source and certitude derive from **divine revelation**.

- "Sacred doctrine is a science because it proceeds from principles known by the light of a higher science, namely, the science of God and the blessed." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I, q.1)
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- De Veritate
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- De Trinitate (especially q.2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science (scientia sacra)**
   - Theology possesses the structure of a science, with **principia** derived from revelation.
   - It reasons from **articles of faith** as its foundational truths.
   - Theological conclusions are logically deduced from these revealed principles.
   - Theology is the highest science because its principles come from God.
   - "This science is more noble than other sciences, both by reason of its certitude and by reason of the higher dignity of its subject matter." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.5)

2. **Principia: Faith and Revelation**
   - The **principia** of theology are truths revealed by God, not discovered by human reason.
   - These principles are accepted by faith, which is itself a supernatural virtue.
   - Reason can serve theology, but cannot prove its first principles.
   - The distinction between **natural** and **supernatural** knowledge is foundational.
   - "The principles of any science are either self-evident or are reducible to the conclusions of a higher science; and such are the articles of faith with respect to sacred doctrine." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.2)

3. **Role of Reason and Philosophy**
   - Philosophy is a handmaiden to theology, providing tools for clarification and defense.
   - Reason can demonstrate the **preliminaries** of faith (e.g., existence of God), but not its mysteries.
   - Theology uses philosophical concepts but transcends them by appeal to revelation.
   - There is a legitimate, though subordinate, place for **natural theology**.
   - "Philosophy is handmaid to theology." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.5 ad 2)

4. **Distinction of Theology from Other Sciences**
   - Theology differs from other sciences in its source of principles: divine revelation.
   - It is a **subalternated science**, dependent on the knowledge of God and the blessed.
   - Its method is both speculative (contemplative) and practical (ordered to salvation).
   - Theology unites **speculative** and **practical** dimensions under one discipline.
   - "Sacred doctrine is one, though it treats of things both speculative and practical." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.4)

5. **Unity and Scope of Sacred Doctrine**
   - Theology is unified by its orientation to God as its ultimate end and subject.
   - All theological questions are ordered to understanding God and His works.
   - The scope of theology includes both God in Himself and all things in relation to God.
   - This unity is grounded in the **formal object** of theology: God under the aspect of revelation.
   - "The subject of sacred doctrine is God, not only as He is in Himself, but also as He is the beginning and end of all things." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s conception of **theology as a science** structured by **principia** from revelation became foundational for later scholastic and Reformed theological method. His careful distinction between **reason and revelation** shaped centuries of Christian thought, influencing both Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. The enduring clarity and rigor of his method continue to inform contemporary discussions of theological epistemology and the relationship between philosophy and theology.
