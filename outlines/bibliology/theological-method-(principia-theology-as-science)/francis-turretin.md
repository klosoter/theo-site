# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin developed a rigorous **theological method** grounded in the Reformed scholastic tradition, emphasizing the distinction between **archetypal and ectypal theology** and the necessity of **principia** (foundational principles) for theology as a true **science**. He argued that **Scripture** is the external principle of theology, while the **Holy Spirit** is its internal principle, and he carefully articulated the relationship between **faith and reason** within the framework of systematic theology.

- "Theology is called a science not from the manner of knowing, but from the object known." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- "De Principiis Theologiae" (Disputationes, in Institutes)
- "Theological Science" (various loci in Institutes)
- Willem J. van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (secondary, for context)
- Richard A. Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (secondary, for method and principia)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Archetypal and Ectypal Theology**
    - God alone possesses **archetypal theology** (theology in itself).
    - Human theology is **ectypal**, a finite and analogical participation in divine knowledge.
    - This distinction safeguards the **Creator-creature** relationship in theological method.
    - It undergirds the humility and limits of human theological inquiry.
    - "Theology as it is in God is archetypal; as it is in us, it is ectypal." (Institutes)

2. **Principia of Theology: External and Internal**
    - The **external principle** (principium externum) is **Holy Scripture** as the objective, infallible rule.
    - The **internal principle** (principium internum) is the **illumination of the Holy Spirit** enabling understanding.
    - Both principles are necessary for theology to function as a science.
    - The principia distinguish theology from philosophy and other sciences.
    - "Scripture is the external principle, the Holy Spirit the internal principle of theology." (Institutes)

3. **Theology as a True Science**
    - Theology is a **science** because it has certain, necessary, and universal principles.
    - Its certainty is grounded in the **authority of God** who reveals, not in human reason.
    - Theology’s method is both **deductive** (from Scripture) and **analytic** (clarifying doctrines).
    - Theological conclusions are drawn from **divinely revealed** axioms.
    - "Theology is a science because it proceeds from first principles revealed by God." (Institutes)

4. **Relationship of Faith and Reason**
    - **Reason** serves theology as a minister, not a master.
    - Faith is founded on **divine revelation**, not on rational demonstration.
    - Reason is used to explain, defend, and systematize revealed truths.
    - Theological method rejects rationalism but affirms the use of reason under revelation.
    - "Reason is the handmaid of faith, not its judge." (Institutes)

5. **Methodological Use of Scholastic Distinctions**
    - Turretin employs **scholastic distinctions** to clarify theological concepts.
    - He uses the **question-and-answer** (elenctic) method to address controversies.
    - Distinctions help avoid confusion and preserve doctrinal precision.
    - This method supports the systematic and scientific character of theology.
    - "Distinctions are the nerves of theology." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of **principia** and his defense of theology as a **science** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy and the development of systematic theology at institutions like Old Princeton. His careful distinctions between **archetypal and ectypal theology** influenced generations of Reformed theologians, including Herman Bavinck and Louis Berkhof. Turretin’s method remains a touchstone for discussions of theological prolegomena, especially regarding the relationship between **Scripture, reason, and faith**. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the principial structure of theology and the necessity of divine revelation as its foundation.
