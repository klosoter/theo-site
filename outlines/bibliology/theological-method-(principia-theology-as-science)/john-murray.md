# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached **theological method** with a deep commitment to the **Reformed confessional tradition**, emphasizing the necessity of **Scripture as principium cognoscendi** and the organic unity of **systematic theology**. He viewed theology as a true **science**, grounded in divine revelation and pursued with rigorous attention to the **analogy of faith** and the historic creeds.

- "Theology is concerned with the systematization of the facts of divine revelation." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 4)

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 4)
- "The Nature and Authority of Scripture" (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)
- "The Theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith" (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)
- "Christian Faith and the Truthfulness of Divine Revelation" (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Principium Cognoscendi**
    - Scripture is the foundational source and norm for all theological knowledge.
    - The authority of theology rests on the self-authenticating character of divine revelation.
    - Human reason is subordinate to the testimony of Scripture.
    - Theological method must begin and end with the exegesis of the biblical text.
    - "The Bible is the only infallible rule of faith and practice." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

2. **Theology as a Science**
    - Theology is a disciplined, systematic enterprise akin to other sciences, but with its own unique object and method.
    - Its data are the facts of divine revelation, not human speculation.
    - Theological conclusions must be logically coherent and systematically arranged.
    - The scientific character of theology is rooted in its method, not in empirical observation.
    - "Theology is a science in the sense that it seeks to present in orderly and coherent form the truth which God has revealed." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

3. **Organic Unity of Theology**
    - All loci of theology are interrelated and must be treated as a unified whole.
    - Doctrines must be developed in light of the entire system of truth.
    - The analogy of faith ensures consistency and harmony within theological formulation.
    - Disjunction between doctrinal loci leads to distortion of biblical teaching.
    - "There is an organic unity to the truth of revelation, and theology must reflect that unity." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

4. **Primacy of Exegesis**
    - Sound theology is inseparable from careful, contextual exegesis of Scripture.
    - Theological method must resist speculative abstraction apart from the biblical text.
    - Exegesis provides the raw material for systematic reflection.
    - The confessions and creeds are subordinate to the witness of Scripture.
    - "All our theology must be derived from and tested by the exegesis of Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

5. **Confessional and Ecclesial Context**
    - Theology is done within the context of the church and its historic confessions.
    - The Westminster Standards provide a faithful summary of biblical doctrine.
    - Theological method is accountable to the broader communion of saints.
    - Confessional boundaries safeguard orthodoxy and guide theological development.
    - "The confessions of the church are the product of the church’s reflection upon the Word of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s rigorous articulation of **theological method** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians, particularly in the areas of **systematic theology** and the doctrine of Scripture. His insistence on the primacy of exegesis and the organic unity of doctrine remains influential in confessional Reformed circles. By grounding theology in the principia of revelation and the confessional tradition, Murray provided a model for faithful, churchly theological scholarship. His legacy endures in seminaries and churches committed to the authority of Scripture and the coherence of Reformed doctrine.
