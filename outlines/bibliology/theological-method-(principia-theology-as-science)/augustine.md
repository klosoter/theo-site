# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s approach to **theological method** is foundational for Western Christianity, emphasizing the relationship between **faith and reason** and the role of **divine revelation** as the principium cognoscendi of theology. He views **theology as a science** grounded in the authority of **Scripture** and illuminated by **the inner testimony of the Holy Spirit**, while also affirming the subordinate but real use of reason in understanding divine truth.

- "Understanding is the reward of faith. Therefore, seek not to understand that you may believe, but believe that you may understand." (Sermon 43.7)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- De Doctrina Christiana (On Christian Doctrine)
- Confessiones (Confessions)
- Enchiridion (Handbook on Faith, Hope, and Love)
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- Letters and Sermons (various, on faith and knowledge)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith Precedes Understanding**
    - Faith is the necessary starting point for all theological inquiry.
    - Theological knowledge is possible only when grounded in **faith**.
    - Reason serves faith, not the other way around.
    - The maxim "credo ut intelligam" (I believe in order to understand) shapes his method.
    - "For unless you believe, you will not understand." (Sermon 43.7)

2. **Scripture as the Ultimate Authority**
    - **Scripture** is the principium cognoscendi, the foundational source of theological knowledge.
    - All theological claims must be tested by the canonical Scriptures.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are upheld, though interpretation requires humility.
    - Tradition and ecclesial authority serve to guide, but not replace, Scripture.
    - "For among the things that are plainly laid down in Scripture are to be found all matters that concern faith and the manner of life." (De Doctrina Christiana I.2)

3. **The Role of the Holy Spirit in Illumination**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables true understanding of divine revelation.
    - Human reason is darkened by sin and needs divine aid to grasp spiritual truths.
    - Illumination is both initial (conversion) and ongoing (growth in understanding).
    - The Spirit works through the Word to bring about knowledge of God.
    - "No one understands unless he receives the Spirit of God." (De Trinitate XIV.1)

4. **The Use of Reason in Theology**
    - Reason is a valuable tool, but always subordinate to **revelation**.
    - Philosophy and logic can clarify and defend the faith, but cannot generate it.
    - Reason helps to organize and articulate the truths received by faith.
    - Theological method includes both **ratio** (reasoning) and **auctoritas** (authority).
    - "Reason should serve faith, not command it." (De Trinitate XIV.1)

5. **Theology as a Scientia (Science)**
    - Theology is a **scientia** in the classical sense: a disciplined, ordered body of knowledge.
    - Its principles are received from God, not constructed by human inquiry.
    - Theological method seeks coherence and clarity, aiming at the vision of God.
    - The end of theology is the enjoyment of God in love, not mere intellectual mastery.
    - "The whole life of a good Christian is a holy longing. What you desire ardently, as yet you do not see." (Tractates on the Gospel of John 4.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **faith seeking understanding** and his integration of **Scripture, reason, and the Holy Spirit** shaped the medieval and Reformation understanding of theological method. His emphasis on **theology as a science** grounded in divine revelation influenced both Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. Augustine’s legacy endures in the ongoing dialogue about the relationship between faith and reason, and the principia of theology remain central to systematic theology today.
