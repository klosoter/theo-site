# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a **Reformed theological method** grounded in the conviction that **Scripture** is the sole and sufficient **principium cognoscendi** (principle of knowing) for theology, while God himself is the **principium essendi** (principle of being). Theology is understood as a **science**—a systematic, coherent discipline—ordered by the **analogy of faith** and governed by the **regulative principle**. The Standards emphasize the necessity of the **Holy Spirit** for illumination and the subordinate role of **reason** and **tradition**.

- "The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture." (Westminster Confession of Faith 1.6)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 1 and 31)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Q&A 1–5)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Q&A 1–3)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on the use of Scripture)
- The Form of Presbyterial Church Government

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Principium Cognoscendi**
   - Scripture is the supreme and sufficient source for all theological knowledge.
   - All doctrines must be either explicitly stated or necessarily deduced from Scripture.
   - The authority of Scripture is self-attesting and not dependent on human testimony.
   - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are affirmed for all matters of faith and practice.
   - "The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof." (WCF 1.4)

2. **God as the Principium Essendi**
   - God is the ultimate ground and source of all theological truth.
   - Theology is possible only because God has revealed himself.
   - The being and attributes of God are foundational for all theological reflection.
   - The knowledge of God is both the beginning and end of theology.
   - "There is but one only, living, and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection." (WCF 2.1)

3. **Theology as a Science**
   - Theology is a coherent, systematic discipline with its own principles and method.
   - Theological conclusions are drawn by necessary consequence from Scripture.
   - The analogy of faith governs the interpretation and systematization of doctrine.
   - The discipline aims at the glory of God and the edification of the church.
   - "By good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture." (WCF 1.6)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Theological Knowledge**
   - The Holy Spirit enables the right understanding and application of Scripture.
   - Illumination is necessary for grasping spiritual truths.
   - The inward work of the Spirit is distinguished from mere intellectual assent.
   - Assurance of the truth and authority of Scripture comes from the Spirit’s testimony.
   - "Our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit." (WCF 1.5)

5. **Subordinate Role of Reason and Tradition**
   - Reason and tradition serve as ministerial, not magisterial, aids in theology.
   - Church councils and confessions are subject to the authority of Scripture.
   - Human reason is to be used in submission to the Word of God.
   - Tradition is valued but always tested by Scripture.
   - "All synods or councils, since the Apostles’ times, whether general or particular, may err; and many have erred." (WCF 31.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped the **Reformed doctrine of Scripture** and the understanding of theology as a disciplined science. Their articulation of **principia** has influenced generations of confessional theology, especially in Presbyterian and Reformed traditions. By emphasizing the sufficiency and authority of Scripture, the Standards continue to serve as a benchmark for theological method and ecclesiastical practice. Their legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to sola Scriptura and the regulative principle in Reformed churches worldwide.
