# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner’s theological method is marked by a dialectical approach that emphasizes the **encounter between God and humanity** and the necessity of **divine revelation** as the principium of theology. He rejected both **natural theology** and purely rationalist approaches, insisting that **theology is a science** only insofar as it is grounded in the self-disclosure of God in Christ and Scripture. Brunner’s method is characterized by the interplay of **faith and reason**, but always with the primacy of revelation.

- "Revelation is not the communication of truths, but the communication of Himself." (Revelation and Reason)

## Key Works

- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge (1946)
- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- The Philosophy of Religion from the Standpoint of Protestant Theology (1928)
- Dogmatics, Vol. I: The Christian Doctrine of God (1949)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Personal Encounter**
    - Theology begins with God’s self-revelation, not human speculation.
    - Revelation is fundamentally a personal event, not merely propositional truth.
    - The encounter with God in Christ is the foundation of all theological knowledge.
    - Human reason is insufficient apart from God’s initiative in revelation.
    - "God does not reveal a system of truth, but Himself." (Revelation and Reason)

2. **Rejection of Natural Theology**
    - Brunner denies that unaided human reason can attain true knowledge of God.
    - He critiques all attempts to establish theology on philosophical or natural grounds.
    - Any knowledge of God outside revelation is, at best, ambiguous and unreliable.
    - The so-called "point of contact" is itself a result of revelation, not nature.
    - "There is no way from us to God—not even a via negativa—but from God to us." (Nature and Grace)

3. **Theology as Science of Faith**
    - Theology is a science only insofar as it is grounded in faith’s response to revelation.
    - The objectivity of theology rests on the objectivity of God’s self-disclosure.
    - Faith is not irrational, but it is supra-rational, transcending mere reason.
    - Theological method must respect the unique epistemological status of revelation.
    - "Faith is the organ of knowledge for the reality of God." (Revelation and Reason)

4. **Dialectical Method**
    - Brunner employs a dialectical approach, emphasizing paradox and tension.
    - Human sinfulness and divine grace are held in constant tension in theological reflection.
    - The limits of human language and concepts are acknowledged in speaking of God.
    - Theology must always be open to correction by the living Word of God.
    - "Theology must always be aware of the dialectic between God’s transcendence and immanence." (Dogmatics I)

5. **Scripture as Norm but Not Identical with Revelation**
    - Scripture is the normative witness to revelation but not revelation itself.
    - The Word of God is encountered supremely in Christ, to whom Scripture testifies.
    - The authority of Scripture is derivative from its function as witness to the divine encounter.
    - Theological method requires critical engagement with the biblical text, guided by the Spirit.
    - "The Bible is the record of revelation, not revelation itself." (Revelation and Reason)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **theological method** significantly shaped 20th-century Protestant thought, especially in the context of the **dialectical theology** movement. His insistence on revelation as personal encounter and his critique of natural theology influenced both allies and critics, notably in his famous debate with Karl Barth. Brunner’s nuanced understanding of **theology as a science of faith** continues to inform discussions on the relationship between faith, reason, and revelation in contemporary theology.
