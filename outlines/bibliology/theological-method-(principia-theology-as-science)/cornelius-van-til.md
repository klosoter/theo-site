# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til developed a distinctive **Reformed theological method** grounded in the doctrines of **principia**, emphasizing **theology as a true science** with God as its ultimate foundation. He insisted that all theological reasoning must begin with **presupposed divine revelation** and that human knowledge is analogical, dependent on the **self-attesting authority of Scripture**. Van Til’s approach fundamentally challenged both rationalist and empiricist methodologies by rooting all knowledge in the **Trinitarian God**.

- "The Christian, therefore, must presuppose the self-attesting Christ of Scripture in order to have any intelligible meaning in his experience." ("The Defense of the Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Principia: God as the Ultimate Starting Point**
    - All knowledge, including theology, begins with the **self-revelation of the Triune God**.
    - **Principium cognoscendi** (principle of knowing) is **Scripture**, while **principium essendi** (principle of being) is God Himself.
    - Human reason is always subordinate to God’s revelation.
    - There is no neutral ground between believer and unbeliever in epistemology.
    - "God is Himself the final reference point in all human predication." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Theology as Science: Analogical Knowledge**
    - Theology is a **science** because it has a definite object (God) and method (revelation).
    - Human knowledge is **analogical**, not univocal or equivocal, reflecting the Creator-creature distinction.
    - Scientific theology depends on the **self-attesting authority of Scripture**.
    - Theological method must reject autonomous human reasoning.
    - "All human knowledge is analogical of the knowledge that God has of himself and of the world." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Presuppositionalism**
    - All reasoning is governed by **presuppositions**; for the Christian, these are rooted in Scripture.
    - Neutrality in method is impossible; every system is based on ultimate commitments.
    - Apologetics and theology are inseparable, both grounded in the same principia.
    - The antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought is methodological and epistemological.
    - "There is no such thing as a purely objective, presuppositionless approach to facts." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Revelation as the Foundation of Knowledge**
    - **Special revelation** in Scripture is necessary for true knowledge of God and the world.
    - **General revelation** is interpreted rightly only through the lens of Scripture.
    - The Holy Spirit enables proper understanding of revelation.
    - The authority of revelation is self-authenticating and not subject to external validation.
    - "Revelation must be thought of as the light in terms of which all else is seen." (The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture)

5. **Antithesis and the Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - There is a fundamental **antithesis** between regenerate and unregenerate thought.
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** is central to all theological method.
    - Human knowledge is dependent and derivative, never exhaustive.
    - Theological method must always respect the qualitative difference between God and man.
    - "The difference between God’s knowledge and man’s knowledge is not merely quantitative but qualitative." (A Christian Theory of Knowledge)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s theological method has profoundly shaped **Reformed epistemology** and apologetics, especially through his emphasis on **presuppositionalism** and the principia of theology. His insistence on the **self-attesting authority of Scripture** and the necessity of analogical reasoning has influenced generations of theologians and apologists, particularly within the Westminster tradition. While his approach has sparked significant debate, it remains a cornerstone for those seeking to articulate a consistently Reformed doctrine of theological method.
