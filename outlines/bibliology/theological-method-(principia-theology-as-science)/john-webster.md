# John Webster (1955–2016)

John Webster advanced a **theological method** rooted in the conviction that **theology is a science** grounded in the **principia** of divine revelation and the self-communicating God. He insisted that **theological reasoning** must be governed by the objectivity of God’s self-disclosure in **Holy Scripture**, and that theology’s scientific character derives from its ordered participation in the knowledge of God as given by God.

- "Christian theology is a work of regenerate intelligence, awakened and illuminated by divine instruction." (Holiness)

## Key Works

- Holiness
- The Domain of the Word: Scripture and Theological Reason
- God Without Measure: Working Papers in Christian Theology, Vols. 1 & 2
- Confessing God: Essays in Christian Dogmatics II
- "Principles of Systematic Theology" (in International Journal of Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science of God**
    - Theology is a disciplined, rational inquiry into the reality of God as revealed.
    - Its scientific character is determined by its object: the triune God.
    - Theological method is shaped by the givenness of divine revelation, not by autonomous human reason.
    - Theology’s norms and criteria are internal to its subject matter, not externally imposed.
    - "Theology is scientific to the extent that it is determined by its object, God, and not by the subject, the theologian." (God Without Measure, Vol. 1)

2. **Principia: God and Revelation**
    - The principia of theology are the triune God (principium essendi) and God’s self-communication in revelation (principium cognoscendi).
    - Theology depends on God’s initiative in making himself known.
    - Scripture is the divinely appointed medium of revelation, not a neutral source.
    - The Spirit’s work is essential for the reception and understanding of revelation.
    - "The principia of Christian theology are not epistemic postulates but the living God and his self-giving." (Domain of the Word)

3. **Dogmatic Reasoning and Ecclesial Context**
    - Theological method is inherently dogmatic, shaped by the confession of the church.
    - The church’s tradition and creeds serve as guides, not as autonomous authorities.
    - Theology is a communal activity, undertaken within the life of the church.
    - Theological reasoning is accountable to the rule of faith and the canon of Scripture.
    - "Dogmatics is the church’s ordered reflection on the gospel, under the authority of the Word." (Confessing God)

4. **Scripture as Normative Principle**
    - Scripture is the normative and authoritative principle for theological knowledge.
    - The Bible is not merely a historical document but the living Word of God.
    - Exegesis and dogmatics are inseparable in theological method.
    - The Spirit illumines the text, enabling true theological understanding.
    - "Scripture is not simply a sourcebook but the means by which God addresses and forms his people." (Domain of the Word)

5. **Theological Reason as Regenerate Reason**
    - Theological knowledge is possible only through the renewal of the mind by the Holy Spirit.
    - Human reason is not autonomous but is sanctified and ordered by God’s Word.
    - Faith and obedience are prerequisites for true theological understanding.
    - Theological method is marked by humility, prayer, and dependence on God.
    - "Theology is an exercise of reason sanctified by the Spirit and ordered to the praise of God." (Holiness)

## Legacy and Impact

Webster’s articulation of **theology as a science** grounded in the principia of God and revelation has significantly shaped contemporary dogmatics, especially in the English-speaking world. His insistence on the primacy of **divine revelation** and the ecclesial context of theology has influenced a generation of theologians seeking to recover classical theological method. Webster’s work continues to serve as a touchstone for discussions about the nature, task, and limits of systematic theology.
