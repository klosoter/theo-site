# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed theological method** by grounding all doctrine in **Scripture** as the sole and sufficient **principium cognoscendi**. They present **theology as a true science**, rooted in God’s self-revelation and structured by the church’s confessional standards, emphasizing the necessity of **faith** and the work of the **Holy Spirit** for understanding divine truth.

- "We believe that those Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 2–7
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Lord’s Days 6, 7, and 31
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially the Rejection of Errors and opening sections
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard collected editions)
- Lyle D. Bierma, "An Introduction to the Heidelberg Catechism"
- J. van Genderen & W. H. Velema, "Concise Reformed Dogmatics"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole Principium Cognoscendi**
    - **Holy Scripture** is the only infallible rule for faith and doctrine.
    - All theological claims must be tested by the clear teaching of Scripture.
    - The confessions explicitly reject any human tradition as a co-equal source.
    - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture are foundational for theological method.
    "We believe that this Holy Scripture doth most perfectly contain the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

2. **Theology as a True Science**
    - Theology is a systematic and ordered discipline, grounded in **divine revelation**.
    - The confessions present doctrine in a logical, catechetical, and scholastic structure.
    - **Faith seeks understanding**, and reason is employed in service to revelation.
    - Theological method is not speculative but rooted in the revealed Word.
    "We believe that all things necessary for faith and life are clearly set forth in Scripture." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

3. **Principium Essendi: God’s Self-Revelation**
    - **God Himself** is the ultimate ground (principium essendi) of theology.
    - True knowledge of God depends on His initiative to reveal Himself.
    - The confessions stress the distinction between **Creator and creature**.
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables the apprehension of God’s revelation.
    "We know Him by two means: first, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe; second, by His holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

4. **Necessity of Faith and the Spirit’s Illumination**
    - Saving knowledge requires **faith** worked by the Holy Spirit.
    - The confessions teach that unaided reason cannot grasp spiritual truth.
    - The Spirit applies the Word to the hearts of the elect.
    - Assurance and understanding are gifts of grace, not human achievement.
    "Faith is a sure knowledge whereby I hold for truth all that God has revealed to us in His Word." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 21)

5. **Confessional and Ecclesial Context of Theology**
    - Theology is done within the context of the church’s **confession**.
    - The confessions serve as secondary standards, subordinate to Scripture.
    - The unity and purity of doctrine are maintained through ecclesial oversight.
    - Theological method is communal, not merely individual or private.
    "We detest all heresies and errors repugnant to this doctrine, and bring them to the judgment of the church." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have shaped the **Reformed tradition’s understanding of theological method**, establishing a model where **Scripture** is the exclusive source and norm for doctrine. Their articulation of theology as a true science, grounded in divine revelation and practiced within the church, has influenced confessional Reformed churches worldwide. These documents continue to serve as a benchmark for evaluating theological method, ensuring fidelity to the **principia** and the centrality of the gospel in all theological reflection.
