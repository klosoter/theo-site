# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich developed a distinctive **theological method** that sought to correlate the **Christian message** with the **existential questions** of contemporary culture. He viewed **theology as a science** grounded in its own **principia**, yet always in dialogue with philosophy and the human situation, emphasizing the method of **correlation** as central to theological inquiry.

- "The method of correlation explains the contents of the Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers in mutual interdependence." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 1")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- Theology of Culture
- The Protestant Era
- Dynamics of Faith
- The Shaking of the Foundations

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Method of Correlation**
    - Theology must relate **Christian symbols** to the existential questions posed by culture.
    - Theological answers are meaningful only when they address real human concerns.
    - Philosophy and theology are in a dynamic, reciprocal relationship.
    - The method seeks to avoid both **heteronomy** (imposing answers) and **autonomy** (ignoring revelation).
    - "The correlation of questions and answers is the basic structure of theological systematics." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Theology as a Scientific Discipline**
    - Theology possesses its own **principia** and internal logic.
    - It is a "science" in the sense of a disciplined, systematic inquiry.
    - The subject matter is the **ultimate concern** revealed in Christian symbols.
    - Theology must be both critical and constructive, engaging with other sciences.
    - "Theology is a function of the Christian church, and as such it is a scientific discipline." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Revelation as the Ground of Theology**
    - **Revelation** is the source and norm of theological knowledge.
    - Revelation is mediated through history, symbols, and personal encounter.
    - The **principium cognoscendi** (principle of knowing) in theology is revelation, not reason alone.
    - Revelation must be interpreted in light of existential questions.
    - "Revelation is the manifestation of the ground of being for human knowledge." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Existential Analysis**
    - Theology must address the **existential situation** of humanity.
    - Human existence is marked by anxiety, estrangement, and the search for meaning.
    - Theological method begins with an analysis of human existence.
    - Existential questions set the agenda for theological reflection.
    - "The existential situation provides the questions to which revelation gives the answers." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Symbolic and Ontological Language**
    - Theological language is **symbolic**, pointing beyond itself to the ultimate.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they refer.
    - Ontological analysis is necessary to clarify theological concepts.
    - The **being of God** is understood in terms of the "ground of being."
    - "All religious language is symbolic, and its symbols participate in the reality of that to which they point." (Dynamics of Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s **method of correlation** has had a profound influence on modern theology, especially in the dialogue between theology and culture. His approach provided a framework for engaging existential philosophy and addressing the challenges of secularism. While some critics argue that his method risks subordinating revelation to human questions, Tillich’s work remains a touchstone for discussions of **theological method** and the scientific character of theology. His legacy endures in contemporary debates over the relationship between faith, reason, and culture.
