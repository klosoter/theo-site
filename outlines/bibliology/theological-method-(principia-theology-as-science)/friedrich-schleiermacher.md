# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined **theological method** by grounding theology in the **feeling of absolute dependence** and viewing it as a distinct **science** rooted in religious experience rather than external authority. He challenged traditional **principia** by locating the foundation of theology in the self-consciousness of the Christian community, emphasizing the role of **subjectivity** and the communal life of faith.

- "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Dialectic, or, The Art of Doing Philosophy
- Schleiermacher: Hermeneutics and Criticism (ed. Bowie)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Distinct Science**
    - Theology is a unique science with its own method, distinct from philosophy or natural sciences.
    - Its subject matter is the **Christian religious consciousness**.
    - Theological propositions are descriptive of the experience of faith, not speculative metaphysics.
    - Theology organizes and interprets the communal life of the church.
    - "Theology is a positive science, whose system is determined by the religious self-consciousness." (Brief Outline)

2. **Principia Located in Religious Experience**
    - The foundation of theology is the **feeling of absolute dependence** on God.
    - This feeling is universal and precedes doctrinal formulation.
    - Doctrines are secondary, expressing the primary experience of faith.
    - The principium is not external revelation but internal consciousness.
    - "The essence of religion consists in the feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Doctrine as Expression of Faith**
    - Doctrines articulate the communal religious experience, not abstract truths.
    - They serve to clarify and communicate the faith of the church.
    - Theological statements are historically conditioned and subject to development.
    - Doctrine is always related to the lived experience of the community.
    - "Dogmatic theology is the science which undertakes to set forth the religious doctrines of the Church." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Hermeneutics and Historical Consciousness**
    - Understanding theology requires attention to historical context and language.
    - Hermeneutics is central to interpreting religious texts and experiences.
    - The meaning of doctrine evolves with the community’s self-understanding.
    - Theological method is dialogical, engaging past and present voices.
    - "Every utterance must be understood first as a part of the whole of language and then as a part of the whole of the speaker’s thought." (Hermeneutics)

5. **Integration of Philosophy and Theology**
    - Theology and philosophy are related but distinct disciplines.
    - Philosophy provides critical tools, but theology’s content is irreducibly religious.
    - Theological method must respect the autonomy of faith while engaging rational critique.
    - The unity of knowledge is sought, but not at the expense of theology’s unique foundation.
    - "Philosophy and theology are related as the general to the particular." (Brief Outline)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s methodological innovations profoundly shaped **modern theology**, especially in the areas of **religious experience** and the understanding of theology as a science. His emphasis on the **subjectivity** of faith and the communal basis of doctrine influenced later liberal theology and the development of hermeneutics. While often critiqued by confessional traditions for undermining objective revelation, his approach remains foundational for discussions of theological method in the modern era.
