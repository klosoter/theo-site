# Kevin J. Vanhoozer (1957– )

Kevin J. Vanhoozer approaches **theological method** by emphasizing the role of **Scripture as the principium cognoscendi** and the necessity of **theology as a science** grounded in **divine revelation**. He advocates for a **theodramatic** and **hermeneutical** approach, insisting that theology is both a disciplined study and a lived participation in the drama of redemption.

- "Theology is best understood as the church’s attempt to understand what it must say and do to participate fittingly in the drama of redemption." ("The Drama of Doctrine")

## Key Works

- The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical-Linguistic Approach to Christian Theology
- First Theology: God, Scripture & Hermeneutics
- Remythologizing Theology: Divine Action, Passion, and Authorship
- Biblical Authority After Babel: Retrieving the Solas in the Spirit of Mere Protestant Christianity
- Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (editor)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Principium Cognoscendi**
    - Scripture is the foundational source and norm for all theological knowledge.
    - The Bible is not merely a text but the communicative act of the triune God.
    - The authority of Scripture is both ontological (from God) and functional (in the church).
    - Theological method must begin and end with attentive, canonical interpretation.
    - "Scripture is the means by which God continues to speak and act in the world." (The Drama of Doctrine)

2. **Theology as a Science of God’s Drama**
    - Theology is a rational, disciplined inquiry into the drama of redemption.
    - Theological method involves discerning the roles and actions God assigns to the church.
    - Theologians are “dramaturges” who interpret and direct the church’s participation.
    - The scientific nature of theology is rooted in its object: God’s communicative action.
    - "Doctrine is direction for fitting participation in the drama of redemption." (The Drama of Doctrine)

3. **Hermeneutics and Theological Interpretation**
    - Hermeneutics is central to theological method, shaping how Scripture is understood.
    - Meaning arises from the interplay of text, author, and community.
    - The Spirit’s illumination is essential for right interpretation.
    - Theological interpretation is both academic and ecclesial, serving the church’s witness.
    - "To interpret Scripture is to enter into the communicative action of God." (First Theology)

4. **Principia: Revelation, Faith, and Reason**
    - Theology depends on the principia: principium essendi (God), principium cognoscendi (revelation), and principium movendi (faith).
    - Divine revelation is the ultimate ground and starting point for theology.
    - Faith is the necessary disposition for receiving and understanding revelation.
    - Reason serves faith by clarifying and articulating revealed truth.
    - "Theology is a faith seeking understanding, grounded in God’s self-communication." (Remythologizing Theology)

5. **Doctrine as Dramatic Direction**
    - Doctrine is not abstract but directive, guiding the church’s practice.
    - Theological method must connect doctrine to the lived life of the church.
    - Doctrines function as “stage directions” for the church’s role in God’s story.
    - The aim of theology is wisdom for faithful participation, not mere knowledge.
    - "Doctrine exists to enable the church to play its part in the drama of redemption." (The Drama of Doctrine)

## Legacy and Impact

Vanhoozer’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions of **theological method**, especially in the areas of **hermeneutics** and the **theology of Scripture**. His canonical-linguistic and theodramatic approaches have provided a robust alternative to both foundationalism and postmodern relativism. By framing theology as a science rooted in God’s communicative action, Vanhoozer has influenced both academic theology and the practical life of the church. His emphasis on doctrine as direction continues to inform evangelical and Reformed approaches to systematic theology.
