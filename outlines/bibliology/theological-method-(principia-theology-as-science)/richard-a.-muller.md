# Richard Muller (1948– )

Richard Muller is a leading historian of **Reformed orthodoxy**, whose work has clarified the **theological method** of early modern Reformed theologians, especially their use of **principia** and their understanding of **theology as a science**. Muller demonstrates that post-Reformation theologians developed a sophisticated, scholastic approach that distinguished between **archetypal** and **ectypal theology**, and grounded theological knowledge in divinely-given **principles**. His scholarship has been pivotal in correcting misconceptions about the rationalism and method of **Reformed scholasticism**.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Principia as Foundations of Theology**
    - Distinguishes between **principium cognoscendi** (principle of knowing) and **principium essendi** (principle of being).
    - Asserts that **Scripture** is the principium cognoscendi externum for theology.
    - God himself is the principium essendi, the ontological ground of theology.
    - Emphasizes that these principia are divinely given, not constructed by human reason.
    - "The principia of theology are not products of human inquiry but are received from God." (PRRD, vol. 1)

2. **Theology as a True Science**
    - Argues that Reformed orthodoxy viewed theology as a **scientia** in the classical sense.
    - Theology possesses its own proper object, method, and principles.
    - The scientific character of theology is analogical, not identical, to natural sciences.
    - The certainty of theology derives from its divine principia, not from empirical demonstration.
    - "Theology is a science because it proceeds from first principles revealed by God." (PRRD, vol. 1)

3. **Archetypal and Ectypal Theology**
    - Clarifies the distinction between **archetypal theology** (God’s self-knowledge) and **ectypal theology** (creaturely knowledge of God).
    - Human theology is always ectypal, dependent on revelation.
    - This distinction safeguards the Creator-creature distinction in theological method.
    - It undergirds the humility and limits of theological inquiry.
    - "Archetypal theology is incommunicable; all human theology is ectypal and analogical." (PRRD, vol. 1)

4. **Role of Reason and Scholastic Method**
    - Recognizes the use of **scholastic method** as a tool, not a source, in theology.
    - Reason serves theology ministerially, not magisterially.
    - The method includes careful definitions, distinctions, and logical order.
    - Reformed scholastics appropriated Aristotelian categories while subordinating them to revelation.
    - "Reason is a servant in theology, never its master." (PRRD, vol. 1)

5. **Historical Development of Reformed Orthodoxy**
    - Rejects the narrative of decline from Calvin to scholasticism.
    - Demonstrates continuity and development in **Reformed theological method**.
    - Highlights the diversity and sophistication of post-Reformation theologians.
    - Emphasizes the importance of historical context for understanding theological method.
    - "Reformed orthodoxy was not a rigid system but a dynamic tradition of theological reflection." (After Calvin)

## Legacy and Impact

Muller's work has fundamentally reshaped the study of **Reformed scholasticism**, challenging older caricatures of Protestant orthodoxy as rationalistic or degenerate. His analysis of **theological method** and principia has become standard in academic discussions of early modern theology. By recovering the nuanced distinctions and methodological rigor of the period, Muller has provided a framework for understanding the continuity and vitality of the Reformed tradition. His scholarship remains essential for anyone engaging with the history and method of **systematic theology**.
