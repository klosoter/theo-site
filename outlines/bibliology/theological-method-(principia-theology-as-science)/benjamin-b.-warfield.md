# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated a rigorous **theological method** grounded in the **principia** of **revelation** and **faith**, insisting that **theology is a science** with its own objective foundation in **Scripture**. He emphasized the necessity of **divine inspiration** and the **organic unity** of biblical revelation, arguing that theology proceeds by scientific analysis of the data given in the Bible as the principium cognoscendi. Warfield’s approach set a standard for **Reformed orthodoxy** in the modern era, defending the intellectual viability and objectivity of systematic theology.

- "Theology is, therefore, a science, and not a mere subjective conception of religious truth." ("The Idea of Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "The Idea of Systematic Theology" (in Studies in Theology)
- "The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible"
- "Revelation and Inspiration"
- "The Right of Systematic Theology" (in Studies in Theology)
- Selected articles in The Princeton Theological Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science**
    - Theology possesses a defined subject matter: the self-revelation of God in Scripture.
    - It employs a method analogous to other sciences, gathering and systematizing facts.
    - Theological conclusions are drawn inductively from the biblical data.
    - Theology seeks objective, universally valid knowledge, not mere subjective opinion.
    - "Theology is, therefore, a science, and not a mere subjective conception of religious truth." ("The Idea of Systematic Theology")

2. **Principia: Revelation and Faith**
    - The principium essendi (source of being) is God’s self-revelation.
    - The principium cognoscendi (source of knowing) is Holy Scripture.
    - Faith is the internal principium by which the truth is apprehended.
    - Theological method depends on the objective givenness of revelation and the subjective reception by faith.
    - "The Bible is to the theologian what nature is to the scientist." ("The Idea of Systematic Theology")

3. **Scripture as the Norming Norm**
    - Scripture is the sole, infallible rule of faith and practice.
    - All theological claims must be tested against the teaching of Scripture.
    - The authority of theology rests on the authority of the biblical text.
    - Exegesis is foundational to all theological construction.
    - "The Reformed theologian builds on the Scriptures alone." ("The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible")

4. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
    - Revelation unfolds progressively but maintains a unified message.
    - The Old and New Testaments are organically connected.
    - Theological method must respect the coherence and development within Scripture.
    - Doctrines are not isolated but interrelated within the biblical system.
    - "The Bible is not a collection of fragments, but a living organism." ("Revelation and Inspiration")

5. **Apologetic and Polemical Task**
    - Theology must defend the faith against modern skepticism and criticism.
    - The scientific character of theology is crucial for its credibility in the academy.
    - Warfield engaged contemporary challenges to revelation and inspiration.
    - The apologetic task is inseparable from the constructive work of theology.
    - "The theologian must be prepared to give a reason for the hope that is in him." ("The Right of Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **theology as a science** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially at Princeton Seminary, and provided a robust intellectual defense of the faith amid rising modernism. His emphasis on **principia** and the centrality of **Scripture** as the foundation for all theological knowledge remains influential in confessional Reformed circles. Warfield’s legacy endures in debates over the nature of theological method, the authority of the Bible, and the relationship between faith and reason.
