# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth revolutionized **theological method** by grounding theology in the self-revelation of God in **Jesus Christ** and rejecting natural theology as a source of **principia**. For Barth, **theology as science** is possible only because it is a discipline ordered by the unique objectivity of divine revelation, not by autonomous human reason or experience.

- "Dogmatics as a theological science is the scientific self-examination of the Christian Church with respect to the content of its distinctive talk about God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1 (The Doctrine of the Word of God)
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- The Göttingen Dogmatics
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Karl Barth: Theologian of Freedom (Eberhard Busch)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Sole Principium**
    - Theology begins and ends with God's self-disclosure in **revelation**, not with human speculation.
    - The **Word of God** (Jesus Christ, Scripture, proclamation) is the exclusive source and norm for theology.
    - Barth rejects **natural theology** and any attempt to ground theology in philosophy or general human experience.
    - The principia of theology are given, not constructed, and are always personal and dynamic.
    - "God is known only by God and only through God’s own act." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Theology as a Science of the Word**
    - Theology is a **science** because it has a definite object—God’s revelation—and a rigorous method.
    - Its scientific character is determined by its faithfulness to its object, not by conformity to secular academic standards.
    - Theological method is analogical, not empirical or speculative.
    - The task of theology is to listen, witness, and critically examine the Church’s proclamation in light of the Word.
    - "Theology is science seeking the knowledge of the Word of God spoken in Christ." (Evangelical Theology)

3. **Christocentric Epistemology**
    - All theological knowledge is mediated through **Jesus Christ** as the center and content of revelation.
    - Christ is both the subject and object of theology, shaping its method and content.
    - Theological method is thus inherently **christological** and resists abstraction.
    - The knowledge of God is always a gift, never a human achievement.
    - "In Jesus Christ, God’s Word has become flesh and thus the principium of all true theology." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

4. **Critical and Confessional Posture**
    - Theology is always self-critical and confessional, aware of its provisionality and dependence on grace.
    - The Church’s doctrine must be continually tested against the living Word.
    - Barth insists on the **freedom of theology** from both ecclesial and secular coercion.
    - Theological method is dialectical, engaging both affirmation and negation.
    - "Dogmatics is a matter of free, critical, and grateful reflection upon the Word of God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

5. **Rejection of Natural Theology**
    - Barth famously opposed any attempt to find a **natural point of contact** between God and humanity.
    - He argued that all knowledge of God is dependent on revelation, not on human capacity or nature.
    - This stance was articulated most forcefully in his debate with Emil Brunner.
    - Theological method must be protected from philosophical or cultural accommodation.
    - "There is no such thing as a natural theology." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s redefinition of **theological method** as grounded solely in revelation reshaped twentieth-century Protestant theology, challenging both liberal and scholastic paradigms. His insistence on the **primacy of the Word of God** and the rejection of natural theology remain central points of debate in contemporary theology. Barth’s approach continues to influence discussions of **theology as science**, especially regarding the relationship between faith and reason, and the nature of theological epistemology. His legacy endures in both the ongoing retrieval and critique of his **christocentric** and dialectical method.
