# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann’s theological method is defined by a robust **eschatological orientation** that reimagines the foundations of **systematic theology**. He grounds theological knowledge in the **revelation of the Triune God** through the historical events of the **cross and resurrection**, insisting that theology must be both critical and transformative, engaging the world’s suffering and hope.

- "Theology, if it is to be Christian theology, must be open to the future of Christ." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- Science and Wisdom (2003)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Orientation of Theology**
   - Theology is fundamentally shaped by the **future hope** revealed in Christ.
   - The **resurrection** is the decisive principle for theological reflection.
   - The **Kingdom of God** is both the content and horizon of theological inquiry.
   - Theological method is inherently **open-ended**, anticipating God’s promised future.
   - "From first to last, and not merely in the epilogue, Christianity is eschatology." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Revelation as Historical Event**
   - **Revelation** occurs in concrete historical events, especially the cross and resurrection.
   - The **history of Jesus** is the principium cognoscendi (principle of knowing) for theology.
   - Theological knowledge is inseparable from **God’s self-disclosure in history**.
   - Revelation is dialogical, inviting human response and participation.
   - "Revelation is history, and history is revelation." (Theology of Hope)

3. **Theology as Critical and Political Science**
   - Theology must engage with the **realities of suffering and injustice**.
   - It is a **critical discipline** that questions societal and ecclesial status quos.
   - Theological method is inherently **public** and transformative.
   - The **cross** is the criterion for all theological and social critique.
   - "Theology is not only a science of faith, but also a science of hope and freedom." (The Crucified God)

4. **Trinitarian and Relational Epistemology**
   - The **Triune God** is both the source and goal of theological knowledge.
   - Knowledge of God is **relational**, not merely propositional.
   - The **Spirit** enables participation in the life and mission of God.
   - Theological method is communal, shaped by the **church’s witness**.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the Christian doctrine of God’s openness." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

5. **Dialogue with Science and Contemporary Thought**
   - Theology must be in **critical dialogue** with the natural and social sciences.
   - Theological method is enriched by engagement with **philosophy, science, and culture**.
   - **Wisdom** is a key category for integrating scientific and theological knowledge.
   - Theological reflection is interdisciplinary, seeking truth in all spheres.
   - "Theology and science are both quests for truth, though in different ways." (Science and Wisdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s **eschatological method** has profoundly shaped contemporary theology, especially in **political theology**, liberation theology, and ecological theology. His emphasis on the openness of theology to the future and its engagement with suffering has challenged traditional models of **theology as a closed system**. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire theologians to pursue a transformative, hope-filled, and dialogical approach to systematic theology.
