# Scott R. Swain (1974– )

Scott R. Swain articulates a **Reformed theological method** that emphasizes the principia of theology—**Scripture** as the external principle and **God** as the internal principle—while insisting on theology’s status as a **science** grounded in divine revelation. Swain draws from classical Reformed orthodoxy, advocating for a **dogmatic** approach that is both confessional and attentive to the church’s tradition, while engaging contemporary questions about the nature and task of **systematic theology**.

- "Christian theology is a science because it proceeds from divinely given principles to divinely appointed ends." ("The Trinity and the Bible," 2021)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Principia of Theology: God and Scripture**
    - Affirms **God** as the internal principle (principium essendi) and **Scripture** as the external principle (principium cognoscendi) of theology.
    - Emphasizes that theology depends on divine self-revelation, not autonomous human reason.
    - Draws from Reformed scholastic distinctions to clarify the foundations of theological knowledge.
    - Maintains that the principia structure both the method and content of theology.
    - "Theology is a science whose principles are given by God in his self-revelation." (Dogmatic Theology as a Science, 2014)

2. **Theology as a Science (scientia)**
    - Insists that theology is a **science** in the classical sense: a disciplined, ordered knowledge with proper principles and ends.
    - Argues that theology’s scientific character is rooted in its divine source and its rational, coherent articulation.
    - Rejects modern reductions of theology to mere experience or praxis.
    - Sees theology as both contemplative (knowledge of God) and practical (ordered to worship and obedience).
    - "Theology is a science because it proceeds from divinely given principles to divinely appointed ends." (The Trinity and the Bible, 2021)

3. **Dogmatic and Confessional Method**
    - Advocates for a **dogmatic** approach that is self-consciously confessional and ecclesial.
    - Sees the church’s creeds and confessions as guides for faithful theological reasoning.
    - Emphasizes the normativity of the **rule of faith** for systematic theology.
    - Encourages retrieval of classical Reformed and catholic sources for contemporary dogmatics.
    - "Dogmatics is the church’s effort to think and speak faithfully about God in accordance with the gospel." (Reformed Catholicity, 2015)

4. **Theological Interpretation of Scripture**
    - Maintains that **Scripture** is the authoritative norm for theology, interpreted within the context of the church.
    - Supports a theological reading that attends to the canon, Christological focus, and Trinitarian shape of the Bible.
    - Rejects the separation of exegesis and dogmatics, insisting on their mutual dependence.
    - Draws on patristic and Reformed models for integrating biblical and systematic theology.
    - "The Bible is the supreme norm for Christian theology, rightly interpreted in the context of the church’s confession." (The Trinity and the Bible, 2021)

5. **Retrieval for Contemporary Theology**
    - Promotes **retrieval** of classical sources (patristic, medieval, Reformed) for renewing contemporary theology.
    - Argues that retrieval is necessary for addressing modern theological challenges.
    - Sees tradition as a living resource, not a static authority.
    - Encourages critical engagement with both historical and contemporary voices.
    - "Retrieval is not repristination but a constructive engagement with the past for the sake of the present." (Reformed Catholicity, 2015)

## Legacy and Impact

Scott Swain has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed dogmatics** by retrieving and clarifying the principia of theology and the scientific character of the discipline. His work has influenced a new generation of theologians to approach systematic theology as both confessional and constructive, rooted in **Scripture** and tradition. Swain’s emphasis on theological retrieval and the integration of exegesis and dogmatics has contributed to renewed interest in classical Reformed method within evangelical and confessional circles.
