# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian who has advanced a robust understanding of **theological method** rooted in the **principia** of **Scripture** and **revelation**. He insists that **theology as science** is grounded in the self-attesting authority of the Word of God, and that theological knowledge is possible only through the work of the **Holy Spirit**. Gaffin’s approach is deeply influenced by the tradition of **Reformed orthodoxy**, especially as articulated at Westminster Theological Seminary.

- "The principia of theology are not only the objective revelation of God in Scripture but also the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

## Key Works

- God’s Word in Servant-Form: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck on the Doctrine of Scripture
- "The Vitality of Reformed Dogmatics" (in The Pattern of Sound Doctrine)
- "The Usefulness of Natural Theology" (WTJ 2001)
- "The Study of Theology and the Ministry" (in The Pattern of Sound Doctrine)
- Resurrection and Redemption (for methodological implications)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Principia: Dual Foundation of Theology**
    - Asserts that **theology** rests on two principia: the external (Scripture) and the internal (Holy Spirit).
    - The external principium is the self-authenticating revelation of God in Scripture.
    - The internal principium is the Spirit’s work enabling reception and understanding of revelation.
    - Rejects any separation between the authority of Scripture and the necessity of the Spirit’s illumination.
    - "The principia of theology are not only the objective revelation of God in Scripture but also the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

2. **Theology as a True Science**
    - Argues that **theology** is a genuine science because it has a divinely given object and method.
    - Emphasizes that theology’s scientific character is rooted in its principia, not in autonomous human reason.
    - Maintains that theology is systematic, coherent, and rational, but always subordinate to revelation.
    - Insists that theology’s certainty is grounded in God’s self-disclosure, not empirical verification.
    - "Theology is a science because it is grounded in the principia supplied by God himself." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

3. **Revelation and Redemptive-Historical Method**
    - Stresses that all theological reflection must be shaped by the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - Views revelation as organically connected to the history of redemption culminating in Christ.
    - Rejects any static or abstract conception of revelation apart from its historical context.
    - Insists that theological method must be attuned to the progress of revelation.
    - "Revelation is inseparable from the redemptive acts of God in history." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Necessity of the Holy Spirit for Theological Knowledge**
    - Holds that true theological understanding is impossible apart from the regenerating work of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit not only inspired Scripture but also illumines the minds of believers to receive it.
    - Affirms the **internal testimony** as essential for certainty and conviction in theology.
    - Warns against rationalism or mere intellectualism in theological method.
    - "Without the internal work of the Spirit, the external Word remains a closed book." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

5. **Scripture’s Self-Attestation and Authority**
    - Defends the **self-attesting** nature of Scripture as the ultimate norm for theology.
    - Rejects external criteria for validating Scripture’s authority.
    - Argues that Scripture is both the foundation and the boundary of all theological science.
    - Emphasizes that the authority of Scripture is recognized, not established, by the church.
    - "Scripture is self-attesting and needs no external validation to be the principium cognoscendi of theology." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of **theological method** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in its understanding of the principia and the role of the Holy Spirit. His work has reinforced the distinctiveness of **theology as a science** grounded in divine revelation rather than autonomous reason. Through his teaching and writing, Gaffin has influenced generations of pastors and scholars at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond, ensuring that the Reformed tradition remains rooted in its confessional commitments. His emphasis on redemptive-historical method and the inseparability of Word and Spirit continues to inform evangelical approaches to theology.
