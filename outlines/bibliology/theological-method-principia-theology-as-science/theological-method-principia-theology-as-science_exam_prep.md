### ESSAY
Theological method asks what makes theology possible, what grounds its certainty, and how it proceeds as knowledge. In the classical idiom, this requires specifying the principia that found the discipline, its formal object, and the criteria of demonstration appropriate to it. To call theology a science is not to capitulate to modern empiricism, but to affirm that Christian teaching has determinate **principia**, internally coherent procedures, and a proportionate certainty deriving from the one who grounds it. The core question is whether theology genuinely rests on God’s own knowledge and speech or on human construction. The answer turns on the ordering of **principium essendi**, **principium cognoscendi externum**, and **principium cognoscendi internum**, on the Creator creature distinction and **analogical knowledge**, and on the authority of **self-attesting Scripture** as the Spirit’s instrument.

Thomas Aquinas sets an indispensable benchmark. In the opening of the Summa, he identifies sacra doctrina as a science because it proceeds from principles known by a higher science. One does not begin with self evident axioms accessible to unaided reason, but with divine revelation known perfectly to God and to the blessed, from which the church derives articles of faith. This is the doctrine of subalternation. Sacra doctrina is therefore scientia because it reasons from revealed principles to conclusions, and because its higher source confers a certainty that surpasses other disciplines. Aquinas secures two features that any stable method must respect. First, he establishes the object of theology as God and all things under the aspect of God, ensuring that theology is not an aggregate of religious topics but an ordered habitus whose formal object is divine. Second, he insists on **analogical knowledge**. Because of **divine simplicity** and the Creator creature distinction, names for God are neither univocal nor purely equivocal. Analogy, structured by God’s causality and perfections, yields true yet proportioned predication. Aquinas then locates the instruments of this science in Scripture and tradition, admits a ministerial role for philosophy, and articulates **natural theology** as a genuine though limited knowledge of God that prepares and serves sacra doctrina without supplying its articles. Modern examiners will press whether Aquinas’s subalternation smuggles a nature grace schema that renders theology parasitic on philosophy or ecclesial mediation. But on Aquinas’s own terms, subalternation is not submission to philosophy but dependence on revelation. The higher science is God’s knowledge. Philosophy functions only as handmaid, never as principle.

Reformed orthodox theologians appropriated this framework while recasting it to secure sola Scriptura and to guard the Creator creature interval more carefully. Franciscus Junius is decisive. In De Vera Theologia, he distinguishes **archetypal theology**, which is God’s own perfect knowledge, from **ectypal theology**, which is creaturely participation in that knowledge either in the mode of the blessed, of angels, or of pilgrims. This distinction reframes subalternation. The ultimate source of theology is God’s archetypal self knowledge; human theology is ectypal and analogical by definition. Junius then clarifies the **principium essendi** of theology as God himself, and the dual **principium cognoscendi**: externally, the Word of God inscripturated that supplies the content; internally, the Holy Spirit who illumines and writes the law on the heart. He stabilizes the relation of authority and understanding in the tenet that Scripture is autopistos, **self-attesting Scripture** that carries its own divine authority and is recognized by the Spirit’s testimony. Scripture is not proved by authority outside itself, yet it is not irrationally asserted, because the Spirit’s **principium cognoscendi internum** grants a noetic fit between text and soul. Into this structure Junius also integrates a ministerial **natural theology**. Because God reveals himself in the works of creation and providence, reason can truly know that God is and that he is powerful, wise, and good. But given the **noetic effects of sin**, this knowledge is suppressed and distorted; only Scripture, as the external cognitive principle, supplies the saving knowledge of God in Christ and provides the rule to correct and complete natural knowledge.

Francis Turretin consolidates this Reformed method and deploys it against both Rome and the Socinians. In the Institutes of Elenctic Theology, he opens with prolegomena that define the nature of theology, the formal distinction of its principia, and its certainty. Against Rome he argues that Scripture alone is the external cognitive principle of theology. The church is not the principium, but the organ by which Scripture is ministerially transmitted and recognized. The **regula fidei** is therefore identical with Scripture. Turretin articulates perspicuity and sufficiency and insists on the Spirit’s **testimonium** as the inward principle that yields full assurance. He refines Junius’s archetypal ectypal distinction to underwrite **analogical knowledge**, contending that our theology, while true, is ectypal and accommodated. Against Socinians he defends supernatural revelation and the necessity of divine authority for articles of faith that surpass reason. Turretin also treats **natural theology** carefully. He grants that from created effects we can know God’s existence and some attributes, and he accepts demonstrative arguments in a ministerial role. But he denies that such demonstrations can generate articles of the faith or certainty equal to that derived from Scripture. The certainty of theology as science is of the order of faith resting on divine testimony, not of mathematical demonstration. Here examiners often probe whether the appeal to natural knowledge compromises the primacy of Scripture. Turretin’s answer is ordered: natural knowledge is neither a second principium nor a co-rule; it is an instrument within the providential economy that Scripture corrects, elevates, and integrates.

The neo-Calvinist renewal retains the scholastic principia while recasting the relation of theology to culture and science. Herman Bavinck presents the most mature synthesis. He insists that theology has **principium essendi** in the triune God and **principium cognoscendi** in special revelation with Scripture at its apex and in the Spirit who applies revelation to the heart. He advances an organic model of revelation and inspiration, construing Scripture as the climactic inscripturation of a broader economy of **covenantal revelation** in creation and redemption. He affirms the **noetic effects of sin** and the antithesis between belief and unbelief, but pairs this with common grace, which restrains sin and permits real knowledge in the sciences. Theology’s scientific status rests in its derivation from divine revelation and in its participation in the unity of truth. Bavinck criticizes autonomous apologetics and rationalism, yet refuses a fideism that isolates theology from the sciences. The sciences share one principium essendi in God’s ordering wisdom, though they proceed by different objects and methods. He defends the organic authority of Scripture and its self authentication. He affirms **analogical knowledge** consistently with **divine simplicity**, ensuring that the predication of attributes is grounded in God’s self revelation, not in conceptual construction. Importantly, Bavinck argues for a chastened **natural theology**, integral to general revelation, which is only rightly understood within the organism of special revelation. Examiners often press whether such an organismic account blurs the categorical distinction between general and special revelation or between Scripture and culture. Bavinck’s answer is to maintain principial priority. The organism of revelation is not a leveling field; Scripture is the canonical organ of special revelation and the sole external norm for theology. The organism metaphor shields unity, not conflation.

Cornelius Van Til inherits this tradition and sharpens it into a distinctive method. He is best read not as rejecting the Reformed scholastic principia but as insisting on their transcendental entailments. For Van Til, the heart of theological method is the absolute authority of the triune God and the categorical rejection of autonomy. The principia must be specified covenantally. The **principium essendi** is the triune God whose ontological Trinity grounds the possibility of predication, unity in diversity, and the rational order of the world. The **principium cognoscendi externum** is **self-attesting Scripture**, the covenant document by which God addresses his people with absolute authority. The **principium cognoscendi internum** is the regenerating and illumining work of the Holy Spirit, who restores the capacity to interpret the world according to truth. Van Til radicalizes **analogical knowledge**. All human knowledge is analogical because all facts are created and interpreted by God. There is no neutral zone where reason operates univocally. This has implications both for theology’s scientific standing and for apologetics. Theological science cannot seek legitimacy by adopting external canons of evidence or method. Rather, theology discloses the conditions of intelligibility for any science. The **noetic effects of sin** mean that apart from grace, reason will suppress the truth and construct idolatries. Van Til’s transcendental argument contends that the very possibility of logic, induction, morality, and personal identity presupposes the triune God revealed in Scripture. Examiners will ask whether this renders natural theology impossible and whether it rejects the classical proofs. Van Til’s mature position allows a ministerial use of arguments so long as they are recast transcendently, that is, so long as they presuppose the Christian metaphysic and do not pretend to neutrality. He criticizes a Thomistic natural theology that posits autonomous reason but does not deny that created order witnesses to God. The antithesis is ethical, not metaphysical. Created reality remains revelatory; the unregenerate suppress its message.

Against this framework Karl Barth presents a major external challenge. Barth denies principia construed as standing structures. For him, revelation is an act of God in Christ, eventful and free, which coincides with the Word witnessed in Scripture and proclaimed in preaching. Dogmatics is a church science, yet it proceeds by obedient listening to the event of revelation rather than from a prior principium such as Scripture considered textually. He denies **natural theology** flatly, insisting that there is no point of contact apart from grace. He fears that principia domesticate revelation. The Reformed response is to welcome the protest against autonomy and to agree that revelation is act. Yet it argues that God’s covenantal faithfulness includes the stable inscripturation of his speech, that inspiration is the form of that act for the church, and that denying Scripture as principium leaves dogmatics at the mercy of the theologian’s claimed encounter. Barth’s rejection of principia also strains catholic doctrine of the canon and the Spirit’s ministry. Examining this debate clarifies that a Reformed method must be both principial and christocentric, affirming that Scripture’s authority is the instrument of Christ’s kingship carried by the Spirit.

The internal debates of the Reformed tradition are not noise but an index of health. One key difference concerns the scope and status of **natural theology**. Some heirs of Van Til deny any place to proofs or to a pre apologetic acknowledgment of created revelation. Others, following Turretin and Bavinck, maintain a ministerial use of natural knowledge. The right resolution is to affirm that general revelation is universal and true, that unregenerate persons really know God in an inexcusable way, and that the church can point to this witness. Yet any formal use of arguments must be subordinated to Scripture, framed by a Christian metaphysic, and aimed not at neutral adjudication but at exposing suppressed knowledge. A second debate concerns the relation of principia to the doctrine of God. Some fear that invoking **subalternation** or scientia sounds like scholastic rationalism. The proper answer is that subalternation secures precisely what Van Til wants: theology lives from God’s archetypal knowledge, and our ectypal mode is **analogical** by institution. Junius’s architecture anticipates and grounds this. A third debate touches the internal and external principles. If Scripture is self attesting, is this circularity? The mature Reformed response is that ultimate authority claims are necessarily circular in a virtuous sense. One cannot ground the ultimate without begging the question. The question is whether the circle is wide enough to include the preconditions of intelligibility. By showing that only the triune God and **self-attesting Scripture** make sense of logic, morality, and science, we avoid arbitrary dogmatism. The Spirit’s witness is not a private voice but the divine act that opens the mind to the canonical content.

The precise status of theology as science benefits from this integrated assessment. Theology is a science because it possesses stable **principia**, a determinate formal object, and an ordered body of true propositions and habits that conduce to wisdom. Its certainty is moral and theological, resting on divine testimony, but it is not less rational for that. Within the university, theology stands as the queen not by coercion but by service. It reminds the sciences that their objects are creatures and that their methods presuppose a world that is intelligible because it is created by divine wisdom. The unity of knowledge is not imposed but given in God’s unity. This implies methodological humility in interdisciplinary work. Theologians should not attempt empirical demonstration where it is not appropriate, nor should they cede the norm of truth to shifting academic canons. Scripture’s canonicity provides the canon for theology’s judgments, while natural knowledge offers data to be interpreted. The term science must be used analogically, not in the modern empiricist sense.

At this junction, several examiner style objections can be anticipated. First, does this approach fall into bibliolatry by making Scripture the only external principle? No, because the formal honor is christological and pneumatological. Scripture is the Spirit’s appointed organ of the risen Christ’s speech to his church. Its function is ministerial to the triune **principium essendi**. To downgrade Scripture to avoid bibliolatry is to dissolve the form of revelation that the Lord himself has given. Second, how do we account for the role of the church and tradition? The church is the creaturely context in which Scripture is received, confessed, and taught. Tradition gives ministerial norms and prudential wisdom. But the church is not the **principium cognoscendi externum**; it is the Spirit’s community ruled by the Word. Third, if all theology is analogical and ectypal, can we ever speak truly of God? Yes. **Analogical knowledge** is not half truth. It is proportioned truth grounded in God’s own self naming. Because the one who reveals is simple and faithful, analogical predication secures identity of reference, even as the mode of understanding remains creaturely. Fourth, can the unregenerate theologian do science? They can analyze and describe aspects of Christian tradition and even read the canon with great skill. But absent the **principium cognoscendi internum**, they lack the habitus that orders data to God as God. Reformed scholastics distinguish true cognition from saving knowledge; Van Til adds that suppression will misdirect method and conclusions.

The method proposed also avoids ruptures across loci. Doctrine of God governs method because only the triune God renders knowledge possible and secures the ordered unity of truth. **Divine simplicity** grounds the coherence of attributes and protects our analogical predication from fragmentation. Doctrine of Scripture is not a preliminary external to theology but its constitutive norm. Christology controls our understanding of revelation as covenantal and mediatorial; the Son is the exegete of the Father, and the Spirit applies the Word. Ecclesiology shapes our sense of science as a communal discipline ordered to confession and worship. Soteriology explains why **noetic effects of sin** require the Spirit’s inner work, and why assurance belongs to faith, not to external demonstration. Eschatology reminds us that theology is a pilgrim science, both true and incomplete, awaiting consummation when ectypal knowledge gives way to the beatific vision.

The role of proof and argumentation is clarified within this architecture. Classical demonstrations can be deployed insofar as they are re interpreted as principled clarifications of creaturely dependence, not as neutral stairs to God. The teleological order of creation and the intelligibility of moral norms can be pointed out and defended, but only as signs within a **covenantal revelation** that the sinner resists. The transcendental argument is not a trick but an exposition of what must be the case if human practices are to be intelligible. Theology as science therefore uses exegesis, dogmatic synthesis, historical retrieval, and principled philosophic reasoning. But all of this is ruled by the canon and undertaken before the face of God.

Returning to the decisive figures concretizes the position. Aquinas gives the indispensable grammar of sacra doctrina as scientia and of **analogical knowledge**. He guards the formal object and secures confidence that theology has its own mode of certainty derived from a higher science. Junius reframes the structure with **archetypal theology** and **ectypal theology** and gives the Reformed principia triad that displaces ecclesial mediation with Scripture and the Spirit. Turretin deploys these principia in a polemical setting, codifying sola Scriptura as theology’s external norm, securing **self-attesting Scripture**, and narrowing the place of reason to its ministerial office. Bavinck reintegrates these elements in an organic vision of revelation and science, clarifying the relation of common grace and antithesis and tying the principia to the organism of truth. Van Til then presses the transcendental entailments of these same commitments, articulating a covenantal epistemology that guards the method from both rationalism and fideism, from both autonomy and irrational retreat.

Finally, contemporary philosophy of religion and analytic epistemology can be enlisted, not as canons but as allies where they illuminate. Alvin Plantinga’s account of properly basic belief and warrant offers a helpful way to describe why faith in God and Scripture can be rational without inferential proof. The internal instigation of the Holy Spirit tracks the **principium cognoscendi internum**. But such accounts must be placed under the theological principia, lest rationality become a free floating criterion. In the university, theology can inhabit a scientific posture by defending its proper norms and by exposing the suppressed theological judgments in every discipline. In pluralist settings, the method rejects a lowest common denominator. It invites other disciplines to consider whether their own practices do not in fact presuppose what only the triune God provides.

The defended position can be summarized succinctly. Theology is a true science because it proceeds from divinely given **principia** toward conclusions that are analogically true of God and his works. Its **principium essendi** is the triune God; its **principium cognoscendi externum** is canonical Scripture; its **principium cognoscendi internum** is the Spirit’s testimonium. It affirms **analogical knowledge** grounded in **archetypal theology**. It acknowledges a ministerial **natural theology** within general revelation that is corrected and integrated by Scripture. It defends **self-attesting Scripture** with a transcendental account that avoids vicious circularity. It integrates Aquinas’s scientific grammar with Junius’s principial clarity, Turretin’s canonical rigor, Bavinck’s organic retrieval, and Van Til’s covenantal epistemology. This is not a patchwork but an ordered confession that can withstand internal pressures, answer external challenges, and give a coherent account of theology’s distinctive rationality.
