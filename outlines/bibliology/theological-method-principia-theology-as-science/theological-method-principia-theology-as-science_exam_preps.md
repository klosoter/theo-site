### ESSAY
The question of theological method, especially in terms of **principia** and **theology as science**, asks in a concise form what makes theology theology and how its claims can be both rationally articulated and obediently submissive to revelation. To speak of **principia** is to ask for the foundations and sources of theology, and to speak of theology as a **scientia** is to ask how, if at all, theology can be a properly ordered, truth‑apt discipline rather than pious opinion or mere historical description. For a Westminster examination, the pressure points will not only be historical description but whether one can defend an account of **principia** that honors **sola Scriptura**, affirms classical theism, allows a measured **natural theology**, and resists both modern historicism and Barthian collapse of method into Christological event.

A conceptual starting point lies with Thomas Aquinas. Thomas did not invent the language of theology as **scientia**, but he systematized it in a way that became determinative for the Latin West and, indirectly, for Reformed orthodoxy. In the Summa theologiae I.1, Thomas argues that sacra doctrina is a **scientia** in the Aristotelian sense, though not a self‑evident science derived from naturally knowable **principia**. Instead, it is a subalternated science whose **principia** are known perfectly only to God and the blessed and are received by us by **revelatio**. This yields a crucial structure: God as **principium essendi** of theology, the divine ideas and vision of God as **principium cognoscendi** in se, and Scripture and ecclesial teaching as the historical medium of those principles for us. In other words, for Thomas, theology is rational in mode but supernatural in origin; it proceeds by argument from revealed premises to conclusions, but the premises themselves are not demonstrable by unaided reason. He also maintains an ordered **natural theology**, in which reason can know that God is and some attributes, but insists that the mysteries of faith, above all Trinity and incarnation, rest solely on revelation.

The Reformed tradition did not simply reject this framework; rather, it appropriated and reconfigured it under the pressure of **sola Scriptura** and polemics with Rome and the radicals. John Calvin, though not a scholastic in style, is decisive for the Reformed reorientation of **principia**. In the Institutes, especially book 1, Calvin links the knowledge of God and the knowledge of ourselves in a circular, mutually implicating relationship, but he gives pride of place to the **self‑attesting Word** and the **inner testimony of the Spirit**. For Calvin, the **principium essendi** of theology remains God himself in his triune fullness, but the primary **principium cognoscendi externum** is **Scripture**, not ecclesial tradition, and the **principium cognoscendi internum** is the Spirit’s work of illumination and persuasion. Here Calvin innovates against a purely intellectualist or ecclesiocentric account of theology as science by stressing that true theology is inseparable from faith, piety, and regeneration. Yet he does not reduce theology to existential encounter. Calvin still reasons systematically from Scripture, still employs arguments, and still recognizes a **seed of religion** and a natural sense of divinity, though he is intensely critical of speculative natural theology unmoored from Scripture.

Examiners will likely press whether Calvin thereby abandons theology as **scientia** in favor of a kerygmatic or experiential approach. The answer must be no, but with an important qualification. Calvin redefines the subject of theology as the triune God as he relates to us in Christ and as he speaks in Scripture. He displaces the notion of theology as a contemplative ascent to quidditative knowledge of God and replaces it with theology as exegetical exposition, doctrinal synthesis, and practical wisdom oriented to God’s glory and our salvation. Nevertheless, this theological activity still bears the marks of a science in the Thomistic sense: principled, coherent, argumentative, ordered. The difference is that, for Calvin, the medium of the **principia** is irreducibly canonical Scripture and the subjective reception of those principles is inseparable from faith. There is no neutral vantage point from which to construct theology from universally accessible **first principles**; yet theology is not irrational, because faith is a Spirit‑given cognitive posture that apprehends and assents to God’s speech.

The Reformed scholastics, above all Francis Turretin, consciously retrieve the Thomist language of **principia** and **scientia** and subordinate it to Reformed doctrinal commitments. Turretin’s Institutio theologiae elencticae provides a paradigmatic statement. He distinguishes carefully between **principium essendi** and **principium cognoscendi**. The **principium essendi theologiae** is God himself, the object that grounds the being of the discipline. The **principium cognoscendi** is twofold: in the order of nature, there is a **principium cognoscendi naturale**, namely innate knowledge of God and the external works of God in creation and providence; in the order of grace, there is a **principium cognoscendi supernaturale**, namely **revelation** inscripturated in the canonical Scriptures. Turretin sharply restricts theology in the strict sense to that which is founded on supernatural revelation, thus safeguarding **Scripture as principium cognoscendi unicum** for dogmatics and polemics, even while acknowledging a subordinate **natural theology** as part of the preamble to faith.

Turretin also makes explicit the **theologia archetypa/theologia ectypa** distinction. The only true theology in the proper sense is God’s own self‑knowledge, **theologia archetypa**, a simple, non‑discursive knowledge identical with the divine essence. Creaturely theology, angelic and human, is **ectypal**, a derivative, analogical participation in that archetype. Human **ectypal theology** occurs in three modes: the theology of union in Christ according to his human mind, the theology of vision enjoyed by the blessed, and the theology of pilgrimage which we now possess by faith. This framework is critical to maintain **divine simplicity** and **creator–creature distinction** while insisting that we have true, though analogical, knowledge of God. It also grounds the scientific character of theology: our discipline is a systematic, ordered exposition of the ectypal knowledge given in revelation and ordered to the archetypal divine knowledge as its exemplar.

Internal debates within Reformed orthodoxy concern the extent and role of **natural theology**, the relation between **principium cognoscendi internum** and externum, and the precise status of theology as **scientia**. Some, following Voetius and Turretin, give a robust account of natural knowledge of God through creation and conscience and allow a propaedeutic philosophical theology that can demonstrate certain divine attributes. Others, following a more Calvinian suspicion of speculation, restrict natural theology to a faint, suppressed knowledge that must be judged strictly by Scripture. A Westminster candidate will face questions such as whether Romans 1 commits us to real natural knowledge of God, and if so, how to avoid granting autonomous reason a normative role. The best answer is to say that natural knowledge is real but always **covenantally situated** and ethically conditioned, and that in the postfall state it is intrinsically prone to suppression and distortion; therefore, in theological science strictly so called, **Scripture** is the sole external principium. Natural theology has a ministerial, not magisterial, role: it can confirm, illustrate, and remove impediments but cannot norm or correct the deliverances of special revelation.

Herman Bavinck brings this Reformed scholastic heritage into direct confrontation with modernity. Bavinck is decisive because he self‑consciously appropriates the classic Reformed account of **principia** while engaging Kantian epistemology, historicism, and the modern university’s understanding of science. In the Reformed Dogmatics, particularly volume 1, Bavinck restates the Reformed position: God is the **principium essendi** of theology; **revelation** is the **principium cognoscendi externum**; faith, wrought by the Spirit, is the **principium cognoscendi internum**. He insists that theology is a **science** in the sense of a connected system of knowledge whose principles are given by God and whose task is to think God’s thoughts after him as they are deposited in revelation. Against the nineteenth‑century narrowing of science to what is empirically verifiable or mathematically demonstrable, Bavinck argues for a broader notion of **science** as any coherent body of knowledge grounded in reality and governed by proper **principia**. Under this broader sense, theology not only qualifies as science but is the queen of the sciences, because its principia are divine.

Bavinck also expands the doctrine of **principia** to address the organic relation of nature and grace. He strongly affirms **natural revelation** and a real, though insufficient, **natural theology**, and he laments that Kuyperian antithesis theology sometimes spoke as if regenerated and unregenerate people inhabit utterly different epistemic worlds. Bavinck maintains a firm distinction between **principium cognoscendi naturale** and **supernaturale**, but he emphasizes that both have their origin in the one self‑revealing God and that the noetic effects of sin do not destroy the structure of human rationality. This allows him to affirm the legitimacy of philosophy and science as autonomous disciplines in their own sphere while insisting that their **principia** are always, in fact, borrowed from God’s creative wisdom. The internal Reformed debate here focuses on whether such an organic relation between nature and grace dilutes antithesis. A solid answer must stress that Bavinck refuses any neutral ground: the same revelation confronts all, yet human response is divided between faith and unbelief, and only the regenerate, illuminated by the **Spirit**, rightly integrate the data of general and special revelation. Thus the scientific character of theology depends not merely on method but on spiritual posture.

Karl Barth enters as an external yet indispensable interlocutor because he challenges at root the entire **principia** apparatus and its notion of theology as science. In the Church Dogmatics I/1, Barth aggressively rejects **natural theology** and the idea that there can be a general religious or philosophical starting point shared with unbelief. For Barth, the only **principium** of theology is God’s self‑revelation in Jesus Christ as attested in Scripture. There is no independent **principium essendi** known apart from Christ and no generally accessible **principium cognoscendi**. Theology begins in an event of divine self‑speech and proceeds by obedient listening. Barth is suspicious of the language of **scientia**, which he associates with a methodological domestication of revelation under rational norms. He therefore reconceives theology primarily as churchly speech in response to God’s Word, governed by the triune God’s freedom.

From a Westminster standpoint, Barth is a double‑edged figure. Examiners may probe whether one can learn from his Christocentrism and anti‑foundationalism without capitulating to his rejection of **natural theology** and confessional orthodoxy. The answer should acknowledge Barth’s salutary insistence that theology cannot rest on autonomous human capacities or religious experience. His critique exposes the danger of treating **principia** as abstract axioms available to unaided reason. Yet Barth’s position fails to do justice to Romans 1 and to the catholic tradition’s conviction that God has disclosed himself in creation and that this disclosure actually yields knowledge, even when suppressed. Moreover, by making revelation a sheer event, Barth threatens the stability of theology’s principia and the **catholicity of dogma**. If theology’s starting point is always a fresh event rather than stable inscripturated revelation, its claim to be a coherent **science** becomes tenuous. The Reformed scholastic appeal to **Scripture as principium cognoscendi externum unicum** secures both God’s freedom in revelation and the Church’s stable grasp of revealed truth.

The external debate extends beyond Barth to secular concepts of science and religious studies. Modern universities often operate with a positivist or at least empiricist notion of science as hypothesis testing by intersubjectively accessible methods. Theology, by contrast, begins from revealed **principia** that are not universally acknowledged. Does this disqualify theology as science? A Reformed answer, building on Bavinck and Turretin, is that the modern restriction of science is itself a philosophical stance that smuggles in contested **principia** about reality, knowledge, and value. All disciplines, including physics, rest on unprovable starting points. The difference is that theology confesses its **principia**: God, revelation, and faith. Theology is therefore a science in the broader, classical sense of an ordered, coherent body of knowledge grounded in reality and proceeding from given **principia** to derived conclusions. It is not a natural science, but neither are metaphysics, ethics, or history.

A Westminster examiner may push: does calling theology a **science** subtly elevate human rationality and minimize the noetic effects of sin? The candidate should respond by reasserting that the scientificity of theology lies not in the autonomy or purity of reason but in the objectivity and sufficiency of its **principia** and in the work of the **Spirit** as **principium cognoscendi internum**. Human sin corrupts our use of reason, but it does not destroy rationality as such. Regeneration and illumination restore reason to its proper relational posture before God, enabling it to function rightly under revelation. Hence, theology is a redeemed exercise of reason serving faith, not a neutral or autonomous science. The language of **scientia** must always be qualified by the Reformation’s emphasis on faith seeking understanding.

The internal Reformed debates intersect here with contemporary epistemology. Analytic philosophers of religion, such as Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff, though not our primary figures, echo and recast the classic Reformed insistence that belief in God can be rational and warranted without inferential proof. Plantinga’s notion of properly basic belief and the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit parallels, in a more formal epistemic idiom, the doctrine of the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum**. An examiner might ask whether such Reformed epistemology undermines the scientific character of theology by detaching faith from argument. The proper response is that while faith’s rationality does not depend on arguments, theology as a discipline nonetheless articulates, systematizes, and defends the content of faith. The basic warrant of belief lies in **principia** given by God; the task of theology is to display the coherence and implications of that belief. Thus theology remains a **science** in relation to its own principia, even if its foundational warrant is non‑inferential.

At this point the doctrine of **analogical knowledge** becomes crucial. If God is utterly transcendent, how can theology claim genuine knowledge, and if our knowledge is only analogical, does this not undercut theology’s scientific aspirations? Here the classic Reformed appropriation of the analogia doctrine, indebted to Thomas yet modified by Protestant concerns, is indispensable. We affirm that because of **creator–creature distinction** and **divine simplicity**, there is no univocal concept shared between God and creatures as though God were a member of a genus. Yet because of **revelation** and the doctrine of **ectypal theology**, our concepts truly correspond to God as he accommodates himself to us. The analogy is grounded not in human speculation but in God’s own act of making himself known. Therefore, theology is a science of analogical predication: its conclusions are true, though not exhaustive, judgments about God according to his self‑presentation.

A related examiner challenge will be about the relation between theology and other disciplines, especially biblical studies and historical theology. Does the doctrine of **principia** license systematic theology to operate independently, or even over Scripture and tradition, as a kind of speculative superstructure? A confessional Reformed answer must be to the contrary. **Scripture** is the external principium and norm; theology is an ordered reflection on Scripture’s teaching in its canonical totality. Historical theology and exegesis are internal to this enterprise, not external disciplines to which theology may or may not listen. The scientific structure of theology therefore requires a hermeneutical spiral: exegesis feeds dogmatics, dogmatics shapes exegesis by clarifying Scriptural teaching, and historical theology informs both by tracing the Church’s reception of the principia. Theology’s rationality is thus ecclesial and canonical, not individualistic or purely speculative.

My defended position, then, can be stated in synthesis. Christian theology, particularly in the confessional Reformed tradition, is rightly conceived as a **scientia** in the classical sense: an ordered, coherent body of knowledge that proceeds by good and necessary consequence from divinely given **principia**. The **principium essendi** of theology is the triune God, who alone gives being both to the discipline and to its object. The **principium cognoscendi externum** is **revelation** inscripturated in the canonical Scriptures, which is sufficient and self‑attesting, and alone norms theology as theology. The **principium cognoscendi internum** is the **Spirit’s** work of regeneration, illumination, and inward persuasion, which enables faith and thus theological understanding. Within this framework, **natural revelation** and a limited **natural theology** have a real though subordinate role: they witness to God’s existence and power, leave humanity without excuse, and can, under the guidance of Scripture, be integrated into a fuller dogmatic account. Theology is neither autonomous rational construction nor mere repetition of biblical words; it is a Spirit‑guided, rationally ordered contemplation and confession of God’s self‑revelation for the sake of his glory and the edification of the Church.

This position navigates internal Reformed tensions by affirming both the depth of sin’s noetic effects and the ongoing integrity of human reason under grace; it resists external opponents by denying both modern scientism’s narrow criteria of rationality and Barthian suspicion of **principia** and **natural theology**; and it addresses contemporary concerns by showing that theology, precisely as a discipline governed by revealed **principia**, can participate meaningfully in academic discourse while retaining its confessional integrity. At every point, the aim is to hold together what Westminster examiners will insist must not be separated: the lordship of Christ over all thought, the sufficiency and finality of Scripture, the necessity and primacy of the Spirit’s work in knowledge, and the genuine scientific character of theology as a disciplined, accountable, and coherent pursuit of the knowledge of the triune God.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Theology is a **scientia** that, under the **Spirit**, proceeds by ordered reasoning from divinely given **principia** – God as **principium essendi**, Scripture as **principium cognoscendi externum**, and faith as **principium cognoscendi internum** – to a coherent understanding of God and all things in relation to him.
- Decisive figures:
  - Thomas Aquinas: framed theology as a subalternated **scientia** grounded in revelation, with a real yet limited **natural theology** and an implicit **archetypal/ectypal** distinction.
  - John Calvin: reoriented **principia** around Scripture and the **testimonium Spiritus**, stressing theology as faithful exegesis and piety without abandoning rational order.
  - Francis Turretin: codified Reformed scholastic distinctions of **principium essendi/cognoscendi**, natural and supernatural revelation, and **theologia archetypa/ectypa**, asserting Scripture as principium unicum of dogmatics.
  - Herman Bavinck: retrieved this framework against modern views of science, developing a rich account of **principia** and the organic relation of nature and grace while guarding antithesis.
  - Karl Barth: rejected **natural theology** and the classical **principia** scheme, recasting theology as response to the Christological event of revelation.
- Debates:
  - Internal: extent and role of **natural theology**; strength of antithesis versus organic relation; how strongly to emphasize theology as **science** versus as proclamation.
  - External: Roman Catholic and Thomist models of nature and grace; Enlightenment and positivist conceptions of science; Barthian neo‑orthodoxy’s rejection of principial structures.
  - Contemporary: theology’s academic status; relation to analytic philosophy of religion and Reformed epistemology; the impact of historicism and pluralism on claims of **scientific** theology.
- Defended position: Confessional Reformed theology should affirm theology as **scientia** grounded in **divine self‑revelation**, using a robust **principia** doctrine that grants a ministerial role to **natural theology**, safeguards **Scripture as principium cognoscendi unicum**, and locates rational method under the **Spirit’s** renewing work.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - How can theology be a science if its principles are not universally acknowledged? Because all sciences rest on basic commitments, and theology’s revealed **principia** are objectively given by God even if not universally assented to.
  - Does affirming natural theology compromise sola Scriptura? No, because natural theology is subordinated and judged by Scripture and cannot deliver saving or corrective knowledge apart from it.
  - What protects your account from Barth’s charge of domesticating revelation under method? The primacy of **revelation** and **Spirit‑wrought faith** as **principia** ensures that method is servant, not master, of God’s self‑speech.
  - How do noetic effects of sin affect theology as science? They render autonomous theology impossible and make the **Spirit’s** internal work essential, but do not destroy the rational, ordered character of theology under grace.
  - Why is the archetypal–ectypal distinction important? It preserves **divine simplicity** and transcendence while grounding the real, analogical truth of our theological knowledge and its scientific articulation.
