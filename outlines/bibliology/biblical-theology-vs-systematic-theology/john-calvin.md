# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin is foundational for the development of both **Systematic Theology** and **Biblical Theology** within the Reformed tradition, though he did not sharply distinguish the two as later theologians would. Calvin’s approach integrates **exegesis** and **doctrinal synthesis**, aiming for a theology that is both rooted in the **redemptive-historical narrative** of Scripture and organized according to the **loci** of Christian doctrine. His work demonstrates a commitment to the unity of **Scripture** as the source of both theological reflection and practical piety.

- "We ought to read the Scriptures with the express design of finding Christ in them." (Commentary on John)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion
- Commentaries on the Old and New Testaments
- Sermons on various biblical books
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles)
- Calvin’s New Testament Commentaries (various volumes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Scripture and Doctrine**
   - Calvin insists that **Scripture** is a coherent whole, with both narrative and doctrinal elements serving the revelation of God’s will.
   - He resists separating **Biblical Theology** (as redemptive history) from **Systematic Theology** (as doctrinal synthesis).
   - Exegesis and doctrine are mutually informing; doctrine arises from careful reading of the biblical text.
   - Theological loci are derived from the unfolding story of redemption.
   - "Let us remember that the knowledge of doctrine is not an affair of the tongue, but of the life." (Institutes, 3.6.4)

2. **Primacy of Exegesis**
   - Calvin’s theology is grounded in **grammatical-historical exegesis** of Scripture.
   - He prioritizes the authorial intent and context of biblical passages.
   - His commentaries serve as the foundation for his doctrinal formulations.
   - He seeks to avoid speculative theology not rooted in the biblical text.
   - "It is the first business of an interpreter to let his author say what he does, instead of attributing to him what we think he ought to say." (Commentary on Romans)

3. **Christocentric Focus**
   - Calvin sees **Christ** as the center and fulfillment of all Scripture.
   - Both Old and New Testaments are interpreted in light of the person and work of Christ.
   - The unity of the **covenant of grace** is a central organizing principle.
   - Doctrinal synthesis must always serve to exalt Christ and clarify the gospel.
   - "All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ." (Institutes, 2.9.1)

4. **Practical and Pastoral Orientation**
   - Theology is always for the sake of **piety** and the edification of the church.
   - Calvin’s systematizing aims to serve the spiritual formation of believers.
   - He warns against abstract speculation divorced from the life of faith.
   - Theological reflection must lead to worship and obedience.
   - "True theology is not speculative, but practical." (Institutes, Preface)

5. **Order and Clarity in Doctrine**
   - Calvin values **systematic arrangement** for the sake of clarity and instruction.
   - The **Institutes** are structured to present doctrine in a logical, accessible manner.
   - He believes that clear doctrinal synthesis aids both teaching and defense of the faith.
   - Systematic theology is a tool for summarizing and applying biblical truth.
   - "A summary of doctrine is very necessary for all who wish to be fortified in the faith." (Institutes, Preface)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s integration of **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** set a paradigm for later Reformed theologians, emphasizing the unity of **Scripture** and doctrine. His exegetical rigor and Christ-centered approach continue to influence both academic theology and pastoral ministry. The enduring significance of his **Institutes** and commentaries lies in their ability to bridge the gap between the biblical narrative and doctrinal formulation, shaping the contours of Reformed theological method for centuries.
