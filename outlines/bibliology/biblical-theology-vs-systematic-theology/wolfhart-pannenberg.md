# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** through a historicist and revelational lens, insisting that **revelation** unfolds in history and that theology must be grounded in the public, historical events of **salvation history**. He argued that **Systematic Theology** should not be abstracted from the biblical narrative but must be in constant dialogue with the unfolding of **God’s self-revelation** in Scripture, interpreted within the context of universal history.

- "Systematic theology must be open to the results of biblical exegesis, and biblical theology must be aware of the systematic implications of its findings." (Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Revelation as History (ed. Pannenberg, 1968)
- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Systematic Theology (3 vols., 1988–1993)
- Basic Questions in Theology (3 vols., 1970–1973)
- Theology and the Philosophy of Science (1976)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Historical Event**
   - Revelation is not a set of timeless truths but occurs in concrete historical events.
   - The resurrection of Jesus is the central event where **God’s self-revelation** is made public.
   - Both **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** must be rooted in the interpretation of these historical acts.
   - The meaning of revelation unfolds progressively within history.
   - "Revelation is not a communication of truths, but the event of God’s self-disclosure in history." (Revelation as History)

2. **Unity of Theology through History**
   - Theological disciplines must be unified by the historical reality of **God’s action**.
   - **Systematic Theology** is tasked with articulating the coherence of biblical witness in light of history.
   - **Biblical Theology** provides the narrative and content that Systematic Theology interprets and systematizes.
   - The unity of theology is achieved through the eschatological horizon of history.
   - "The unity of theology is grounded in the unity of the history of God’s dealings with the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Critical Engagement with Exegesis**
   - **Systematic Theology** must remain open and responsive to ongoing biblical exegesis.
   - Dogmatic formulations are provisional and subject to correction by fresh biblical insights.
   - There is a dialectical relationship between exegesis and dogmatics.
   - Theological reflection is an ongoing process, not a closed system.
   - "Systematic theology must be constantly revised in light of the results of biblical exegesis." (Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Universality and Public Character of Revelation**
   - Revelation is not private or esoteric but has a universal, public character.
   - **Systematic Theology** must present Christian truth claims as universally valid, not merely ecclesial.
   - The historical events of revelation are accessible to all, not just the faith community.
   - **Biblical Theology** provides the narrative basis for these public claims.
   - "The truth of Christian faith is not a private matter but is to be understood as a claim about universal history." (Jesus—God and Man)

5. **Eschatological Orientation**
   - The meaning of history and revelation is ultimately eschatological.
   - Both **Biblical** and **Systematic Theology** must interpret present realities in light of the future consummation.
   - The final unity of theology is found in the anticipated fulfillment of history in Christ.
   - Eschatology provides the horizon for integrating biblical narrative and systematic reflection.
   - "The future is the key to the meaning of history and the unity of theology." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s insistence on the **historical character of revelation** and the public, universal scope of Christian truth claims has significantly shaped modern discussions on the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**. His work challenged both disciplines to remain open to historical investigation and to maintain a dynamic, dialogical relationship. Pannenberg’s influence persists in contemporary theology, especially in debates about the integration of exegesis, history, and dogmatics. His legacy endures in the ongoing quest for a theology that is both faithful to Scripture and intellectually credible in the public sphere.
