# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not explicitly distinguish **Biblical Theology** from **Systematic Theology** as later traditions would, but his writings laid foundational patterns for both. He approached **Scripture** as a unified, divinely inspired whole, seeking to articulate its **doctrinal coherence** while also tracing the **historical unfolding of redemption**. Augustine’s method combined careful exegesis with a drive toward **theological synthesis**, shaping the Western tradition’s approach to both disciplines.

- "The Old is in the New revealed; the New is in the Old concealed." (Enarrationes in Psalmos)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- De Doctrina Christiana
- The City of God
- Enarrationes in Psalmos
- Letters (Epistulae)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Scripture**
    - Scripture is a single, divinely inspired narrative with Christ at its center.
    - Both Old and New Testaments are essential for understanding God’s redemptive plan.
    - Typology and allegory reveal the coherence between biblical epochs.
    - Theological reflection must always be rooted in the whole counsel of God.
    - "In the Old Testament the New is concealed, in the New the Old is revealed." (Enarrationes in Psalmos)

2. **Primacy of Doctrine**
    - Doctrinal clarity is necessary for rightly interpreting Scripture.
    - The **Rule of Faith** guides interpretation and guards against heresy.
    - Systematic reflection organizes biblical truths for the edification of the church.
    - Theological synthesis is both possible and necessary for Christian teaching.
    - "Let us not therefore listen to those who deny that the books of the Old Testament are to be received by Christians." (De Doctrina Christiana)

3. **Historical Progress of Revelation**
    - God’s revelation unfolds progressively through history.
    - The covenants and events of Scripture display a divine economy.
    - Understanding the historical context is vital for doctrinal formulation.
    - The unity of redemptive history points to Christ as its fulfillment.
    - "The times are different, the faith is the same." (Sermon 5)

4. **Integration of Exegesis and Theology**
    - Exegesis and theology are mutually informing disciplines.
    - Careful interpretation of biblical texts leads to deeper doctrinal insight.
    - Theological questions should drive deeper engagement with Scripture.
    - The church’s teaching office is responsible for both exegesis and doctrinal formulation.
    - "Whoever, therefore, thinks that he understands the Holy Scriptures, or any part of them, so that it does not build up the double love of God and of our neighbor, does not understand it at all." (De Doctrina Christiana)

5. **Role of the Church in Interpretation**
    - The church is the authoritative interpreter of Scripture.
    - Tradition and communal reading safeguard against individual error.
    - The **creeds** summarize the essential teachings derived from Scripture.
    - The Spirit guides the church into all truth through history.
    - "For you are not to believe that you understand the divine Scriptures in any part unless you have been taught by the Church." (Letter 147)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s integration of **biblical exegesis** and **systematic theology** shaped the Western church’s approach to doctrine and Scripture for centuries. His emphasis on the **unity of Scripture** and the necessity of doctrinal synthesis provided a model for later theologians navigating the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**. Augustine’s influence endures in both Catholic and Protestant traditions, especially in the ongoing quest to relate the historical narrative of redemption to the coherent articulation of Christian doctrine.
