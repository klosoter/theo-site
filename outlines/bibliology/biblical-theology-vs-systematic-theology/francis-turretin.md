# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, distinguished between **Biblical Theology** (the historical unfolding of revelation) and **Systematic Theology** (the logical organization of doctrine). He emphasized the necessity of **systematic formulation** for the defense and teaching of the faith, while recognizing the foundational role of **Scripture** as the source of all theology. Turretin’s approach sought to harmonize the historical progression of revelation with the need for doctrinal clarity and coherence.

- "Theology is not to be regarded as a speculative science, but as a practical one, whose end is practice, not speculation." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Catechism for the Churches of Geneva
- Selected sermons and disputations on the nature of theology
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole Source of Theology**
    - All theological reflection must be grounded in **divine revelation** as contained in Scripture.
    - Both **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** derive their content from the same inspired source.
    - The authority of theology rests on the **sufficiency and clarity of Scripture**.
    - Human reason is subordinate to the revealed Word in all theological matters.
    - "Theology is nothing else than the doctrine of living well drawn from the Word of God." (Institutes)

2. **Distinction Between the Order of Revelation and the Order of Doctrine**
    - **Biblical Theology** traces the historical and progressive nature of revelation.
    - **Systematic Theology** arranges doctrines logically for instruction and defense.
    - The order in which God revealed truth is not always the order in which it is best taught or understood.
    - Both orders are necessary for a full understanding of Christian doctrine.
    - "The method of teaching is one thing, the order of revelation another." (Institutes)

3. **Necessity of Systematic Formulation**
    - **Systematic Theology** is essential for the church’s confession, catechesis, and polemics.
    - It provides clarity and guards against heresy by organizing doctrine coherently.
    - Systematic arrangement aids in the practical application of doctrine.
    - Theological systems must always remain faithful to the biblical text.
    - "The system of doctrine is to be drawn from the Scriptures, not imposed upon them." (Institutes)

4. **Unity of Theology Despite Distinctions**
    - **Biblical** and **Systematic Theology** are not separate disciplines but different perspectives on the same truth.
    - Both serve the **edification** of the church and the glory of God.
    - The unity of theology is maintained by the centrality of Christ and the gospel.
    - Distinctions serve clarity, not division, within theological study.
    - "There is only one theology, though it may be considered under different aspects." (Institutes)

5. **Practical End of All Theology**
    - The ultimate goal of theology is **piety** and the practice of godliness.
    - Both historical and systematic approaches must lead to the transformation of life.
    - Theological knowledge is inseparable from spiritual wisdom and obedience.
    - The church’s health depends on the faithful application of doctrine.
    - "Theology is practical, directing us to the worship and love of God." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinction between the **order of revelation** and the **order of doctrine** shaped later Reformed approaches to the relationship between Biblical and Systematic Theology. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the necessity of systematic formulation influenced generations of confessional theologians, especially in the tradition of Westminster. Turretin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to doctrinal clarity, biblical fidelity, and the practical outworking of theology in the life of the church.
