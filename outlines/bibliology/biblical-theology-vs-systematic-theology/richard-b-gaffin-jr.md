# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading voice in articulating the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** within the Reformed tradition. He insists that while these disciplines are distinct, they are mutually dependent, with **Biblical Theology** tracing the progressive unfolding of **redemptive history** and **Systematic Theology** synthesizing scriptural teaching into coherent doctrinal formulations. Gaffin emphasizes that both must be grounded in the authority of **Scripture** and serve the unity of **Reformed dogmatics**.

- "Biblical and systematic theology are mutually dependent disciplines, each with its own distinctive task, but neither can be properly carried out in isolation from the other." (Gaffin, "Response to Vos," in *Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation*)

## Key Works

- "Response to Vos" in *Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation* (ed. Carson)
- *By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation*
- "Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology" in *The New Dictionary of Biblical Theology*
- *Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul's Soteriology*
- *Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit*

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Biblical Theology as Redemptive-Historical**
    - Views **Biblical Theology** as tracing the progressive revelation of God’s acts in history.
    - Emphasizes the centrality of **Christ’s person and work** in redemptive history.
    - Argues that understanding the unfolding of **covenant** is essential for theology.
    - Sees **Biblical Theology** as foundational for faithful exegesis.
    - "Biblical theology is concerned with the process of revelation, the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan in history." (Gaffin, "Response to Vos")

2. **Systematic Theology as Synthesis**
    - Defines **Systematic Theology** as the discipline that organizes biblical teaching into coherent doctrines.
    - Insists that systematic formulations must be rooted in the results of **Biblical Theology**.
    - Warns against abstracting doctrine from the historical context of revelation.
    - Sees **Systematic Theology** as serving the church’s confession and teaching.
    - "Systematic theology is concerned with the finished product of revelation, the permanent doctrinal content of Scripture." (Gaffin, "Response to Vos")

3. **Mutual Dependence of the Disciplines**
    - Argues that neither discipline can function properly in isolation.
    - Maintains that **Systematic Theology** needs the historical grounding of **Biblical Theology**.
    - Asserts that **Biblical Theology** requires the doctrinal clarity of **Systematic Theology**.
    - Stresses the unity of Scripture as the basis for their interdependence.
    - "Each discipline is dependent on the other for its proper execution." (Gaffin, "Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology")

4. **Primacy of Scripture**
    - Upholds the **inspiration** and **authority of Scripture** as the foundation for both disciplines.
    - Rejects any approach that subordinates Scripture to philosophical or historical constructs.
    - Insists that both disciplines must be governed by the text of Scripture.
    - Affirms the sufficiency of Scripture for theological reflection.
    - "The Bible itself is the only source and norm for both biblical and systematic theology." (Gaffin, "Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology")

5. **Eschatological Focus**
    - Highlights the eschatological structure of **redemptive history** in both disciplines.
    - Emphasizes the already/not yet tension in the application of redemption.
    - Argues that eschatology is not a mere appendix but central to biblical and systematic reflection.
    - Sees the resurrection of Christ as the pivotal eschatological event.
    - "Eschatology is not merely a concluding topic but pervades the whole of biblical and systematic theology." (Gaffin, *Resurrection and Redemption*)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped the understanding of the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** in Reformed circles, especially at Westminster Theological Seminary. His insistence on the mutual dependence of the disciplines has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, reinforcing the centrality of **redemptive history** for doctrinal formulation. Gaffin’s legacy endures in the ongoing integration of exegetical and dogmatic work, ensuring that theology remains both biblically grounded and confessionally robust.
