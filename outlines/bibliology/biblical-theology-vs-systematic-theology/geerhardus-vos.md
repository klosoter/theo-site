# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos is renowned for articulating the distinction and relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** within the Reformed tradition. He championed **Biblical Theology** as the study of **progressive revelation** in its historical context, while affirming the necessity and legitimacy of **Systematic Theology** for organizing doctrine according to logical and topical categories.

- "Biblical Theology, rightly defined, is nothing else than the exhibition of the organic progress of supernatural revelation in its historic continuity and multiformity." (Biblical Theology, p. 15)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline
- Reformed Dogmatics
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation (ed. Richard B. Gaffin, Jr.)
- Pauline Eschatology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Biblical Theology is Historical and Redemptive**
    - Emphasizes the unfolding of **revelation** through historical epochs.
    - Focuses on the **organic unity** and diversity of Scripture.
    - Seeks to trace the development of **redemptive history** from promise to fulfillment.
    - Maintains that Biblical Theology is descriptive, not prescriptive.
    - "Biblical Theology deals with revelation as a process, not as a completed product." (Biblical Theology, p. 13)

2. **Systematic Theology is Logical and Synthetic**
    - Organizes biblical data according to **thematic loci**.
    - Seeks doctrinal coherence and synthesis across the canon.
    - Presupposes the completed canon and the unity of truth.
    - Answers contemporary questions by drawing on the whole of Scripture.
    - "Systematic Theology asks, What does the whole Bible teach us today about any given topic?" (Biblical Theology, p. 16)

3. **Complementarity, Not Competition**
    - Both disciplines are necessary for a full understanding of **divine revelation**.
    - Each has a distinct method and purpose, but they serve the same truth.
    - **Biblical Theology** provides the historical foundation for **Systematic Theology**.
    - The two disciplines mutually enrich and correct each other.
    - "The two are not antagonistic, but complementary; the one is the basis, the other the superstructure." (Biblical Theology, p. 17)

4. **Organic Progress of Revelation**
    - Revelation unfolds in stages, each organically connected to the previous.
    - Emphasizes **covenantal development** and typology.
    - Recognizes the unity of God’s redemptive purpose across history.
    - Avoids flattening the diversity of Scripture into abstract propositions.
    - "Revelation is not a heap of isolated facts, but a living organism." (Biblical Theology, p. 14)

5. **Christocentric Focus**
    - All of **redemptive history** culminates in the person and work of **Christ**.
    - Both Biblical and Systematic Theology must be oriented toward Christ as the center.
    - The unity of Scripture is found in its testimony to Christ.
    - The progress of revelation is teleological, moving toward fulfillment in Christ.
    - "The center of revelation is Christ; all lines converge in Him." (Biblical Theology, p. 23)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s work established **Biblical Theology** as a distinct and indispensable discipline within Reformed scholarship, shaping generations of theologians at Westminster and beyond. His emphasis on **redemptive history** and the organic unity of Scripture profoundly influenced the development of modern Reformed hermeneutics. Vos’s careful articulation of the relationship between Biblical and Systematic Theology remains foundational for evangelical and confessional approaches to Scripture. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to a **Christ-centered** reading of the whole Bible.
