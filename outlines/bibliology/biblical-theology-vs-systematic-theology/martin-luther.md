# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther emphasized the centrality of **Scripture** as the ultimate authority for theology, often blurring the lines between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**. While he did not formally distinguish these disciplines, Luther’s focus on the **literal sense** and **Christocentric interpretation** of the Bible laid groundwork for later developments in both fields, insisting that all doctrine must be rooted in the clear teaching of **God’s Word**.

- "The true rule is this: God’s Word shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel can do so." (Smalcald Articles)

## Key Works

- 95 Theses (1517)
- Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans (1522)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Table Talk

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole Authority**
   - All theology must be grounded in **Scripture alone** (**sola Scriptura**).
   - Human traditions and philosophical systems are subordinate to the Bible.
   - Both doctrinal formulation and biblical exposition derive their legitimacy from the text.
   - The clarity of Scripture ensures accessibility for all believers.
   - "What is asserted without the Scriptures or proven revelation may be held as an opinion, but need not be believed." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Christocentric Interpretation**
   - The person and work of **Christ** is the center of all biblical revelation.
   - Both Old and New Testaments testify to Christ and His redemptive work.
   - Theological synthesis must always return to the gospel.
   - Exegesis is incomplete if it does not lead to Christ.
   - "Take Christ from the Scriptures, and what more will you find in them?" (Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans)

3. **Literal Sense as Primary**
   - The **literal (grammatical-historical) sense** is the foundation for all interpretation.
   - Allegorical or speculative readings are rejected unless grounded in the literal sense.
   - Systematic formulations must not override the plain meaning of Scripture.
   - The unity of Scripture is found in its clear, literal proclamation.
   - "The Holy Spirit is the simplest writer and speaker in heaven and on earth." (Table Talk)

4. **Doctrine in Service of the Gospel**
   - The purpose of doctrine is to clarify and proclaim the **gospel**.
   - Systematic categories are useful only insofar as they serve the message of justification by faith.
   - Theological systems must be subordinate to the living voice of the gospel.
   - The distinction between law and gospel is central for both exegesis and doctrine.
   - "The distinction between law and gospel is the highest art in Christendom." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Unity of Biblical and Systematic Theology**
   - Luther did not formally separate **Biblical Theology** from **Systematic Theology**.
   - Both disciplines are united in their dependence on Scripture and their focus on Christ.
   - Theological reflection is always exegetical and pastoral, not merely speculative.
   - The aim is the edification of the church through faithful proclamation.
   - "We must let Scripture have the first and last word." (Table Talk)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s insistence on **sola Scriptura** and the **Christocentric** reading of the Bible profoundly shaped both **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** in the Protestant tradition. His approach encouraged later theologians to ground doctrinal synthesis in the text of Scripture itself. While he did not develop a formal distinction between the two disciplines, his legacy endures in the ongoing Reformation emphasis on the primacy of the Bible for all theological reflection.
