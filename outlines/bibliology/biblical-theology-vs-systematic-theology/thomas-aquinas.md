# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** through the lens of **sacred doctrine** (sacra doctrina), which he understood as a unified science rooted in **divine revelation**. For Aquinas, the exposition of **Scripture** and the rational ordering of **theological loci** were inseparable, with **systematic theology** serving to clarify and organize the truths found in the biblical text.

- "Sacred doctrine makes use even of human reason, not, indeed, to prove faith, but to make clear other things that are put forward in this doctrine." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.8)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- Expositio super Isaiam ad litteram (Commentary on Isaiah)
- Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Sacred Doctrine**
   - Aquinas viewed **theology** as a single, unified science grounded in **divine revelation**.
   - Both the exposition of Scripture and systematic reflection are aspects of the same **sacra doctrina**.
   - Theological method integrates **biblical exegesis** with rational synthesis.
   - The unity of doctrine ensures coherence between biblical content and systematic formulation.
   - "Sacred doctrine essentially treats of God, and of the works of God as related to Him as their beginning and end." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.7)

2. **Primacy of Scripture**
   - All theological reflection is ultimately rooted in **Scripture** as the highest authority.
   - Systematic theology must be accountable to the biblical text.
   - Aquinas frequently cites and interprets Scripture in his systematic works.
   - The literal sense of Scripture is foundational for theological construction.
   - "The author of Holy Writ is God, in whose power it is to signify His meaning, not by words only, as man also can do, but also by things themselves." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.10)

3. **Role of Reason in Theology**
   - **Reason** serves theology by organizing and clarifying revealed truths.
   - Systematic theology employs philosophical concepts to articulate biblical doctrine.
   - Reason cannot prove the mysteries of faith but can defend and explain them.
   - Theological method is both **biblical** and rational, reflecting the harmony of faith and reason.
   - "Faith does not destroy reason but perfects it." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.8)

4. **Distinction and Harmony of Methods**
   - Aquinas distinguished between the **order of discovery** (biblical narrative) and the **order of teaching** (systematic exposition).
   - Systematic theology arranges doctrines logically, while biblical theology follows the unfolding of revelation.
   - Both methods are necessary for a full understanding of Christian truth.
   - The distinction is methodological, not substantive; both serve the same truth.
   - "It is the part of the wise man to arrange and to judge." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.6)

5. **Goal of Theology: Contemplation of God**
   - The ultimate aim of both biblical and systematic theology is the **knowledge of God**.
   - Theological study leads to the contemplation and love of God as the highest good.
   - Systematic organization aids in directing the mind toward divine realities.
   - The unity of theology serves the end of **beatific vision**.
   - "Theology is taught by God, teaches of God, and leads to God." (Summa Theologiae Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **biblical exegesis** and **systematic theology** established a model for later Christian thought, especially within the **Roman Catholic** tradition. His understanding of **sacra doctrina** as a unified science continues to influence debates on the relationship between Scripture and theological systematization. Aquinas’s approach shaped the scholastic method and provided a framework for integrating **biblical theology** and **systematic theology** in a coherent and mutually enriching way.
