# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** through his distinctive **multiperspectivalism**, emphasizing that both disciplines are necessary and mutually enriching. He insists that **Systematic Theology** must be grounded in the redemptive-historical unfolding of **Scripture**, while **Biblical Theology** is incomplete without doctrinal synthesis. Frame resists sharp dichotomies, advocating for a holistic, **theologically integrated** approach to the study of God's Word.

- "Systematic theology is the application of God’s word by persons to all areas of life." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- "Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology as Disciplines of the Word" (in Theological Studies and the Church, 1976)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Multiperspectival Integration**
    - Both **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** are perspectives on the same divine truth.
    - Each discipline corrects and enriches the other, preventing reductionism.
    - Multiperspectivalism resists the isolation of theological methods.
    - Theological understanding requires correlating exegesis, redemptive history, and doctrinal synthesis.
    - "We need all the perspectives we can get, and we need to integrate them." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

2. **Primacy of Scripture**
    - All theology must be rooted in the authority and sufficiency of **Scripture**.
    - **Systematic Theology** is valid only as it faithfully summarizes biblical teaching.
    - **Biblical Theology** traces the progressive revelation within the canon.
    - Both disciplines are subject to the text of Scripture as the ultimate norm.
    - "The Bible is the ultimate criterion for all theological work." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - **Biblical Theology** highlights the unfolding of God’s plan in history.
    - **Systematic Theology** must account for the historical context of revelation.
    - The unity of Scripture is seen in its redemptive-historical structure.
    - Doctrinal synthesis should not flatten or ignore biblical development.
    - "Systematic theology must be sensitive to the historical progress of revelation." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

4. **Application to All of Life**
    - Theology is not abstract but is meant for the transformation of life.
    - **Systematic Theology** applies biblical truth to contemporary issues.
    - **Biblical Theology** provides the narrative context for application.
    - The disciplines together serve the church’s mission and discipleship.
    - "Theology is the application of Scripture, by persons, to every area of life." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

5. **Rejection of False Dichotomies**
    - Frame opposes the separation of **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** as rival enterprises.
    - Both are necessary for a full understanding of God’s revelation.
    - Theological method should be dialogical, not adversarial.
    - Integration fosters humility and deeper insight into the truth.
    - "We should not set biblical theology and systematic theology in opposition to one another." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by challenging artificial boundaries between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**. His **multiperspectival** approach has encouraged theologians to pursue a more integrated and scripturally faithful method. Frame’s influence is evident in the renewed emphasis on the unity of theological disciplines and the application of doctrine to all of life within evangelical and Reformed circles.
