# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til maintained that **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** are distinct yet inseparable disciplines within the Reformed tradition. He argued that while **Biblical Theology** traces the progressive, historical unfolding of **revelation**, **Systematic Theology** organizes the content of Scripture into a coherent, logical system, both presupposing the authority of **Scripture** and the necessity of a **Reformed worldview**.

- "Systematic theology is impossible unless it be truly biblical theology, and biblical theology is impossible unless it be truly systematic theology." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture
- Christian-Theistic Evidences
- Essays on Biblical and Systematic Theology (in The New Testament Student and Van Til: Essays in Honor of Cornelius Van Til)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Biblical and Systematic Theology**
    - Both disciplines are grounded in the **self-attesting authority of Scripture**.
    - **Biblical Theology** provides the historical and redemptive context for doctrinal formulation.
    - **Systematic Theology** synthesizes biblical data into a coherent worldview.
    - The two must not be separated, as each depends on the other for faithful theological reflection.
    - "Biblical theology and systematic theology are mutually dependent and must be pursued together." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Presuppositional Method**
    - All theological study begins with the **presupposition of God’s revelation**.
    - Human reason is always subordinate to the **authority of Scripture**.
    - Both disciplines must reject **autonomous human reasoning**.
    - The antithesis between **Christian and non-Christian thought** shapes both biblical and systematic approaches.
    - "We must presuppose the truth of Christianity as a whole when we engage in any theological discipline." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - **Biblical Theology** traces the unfolding of **God’s covenantal revelation** in history.
    - **Systematic Theology** must be informed by the progress of **redemptive history**.
    - The unity of Scripture is seen in the **Christ-centered unfolding** of God’s plan.
    - Doctrinal synthesis must respect the historical progression of revelation.
    - "The facts of Scripture are never isolated; they are always part of God’s redemptive plan." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Analogy and Systematization**
    - Human knowledge is always **analogical** to God’s knowledge.
    - **Systematic Theology** is possible because God has revealed Himself in a coherent way.
    - Theological systems must reflect the **unity and diversity** found in Scripture.
    - The analogical relationship preserves both the **mystery and clarity** of divine truth.
    - "All our theology is analogical; we think God’s thoughts after Him, never as He thinks them." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Antithesis and Christian Worldview**
    - There is a fundamental **antithesis** between Christian and non-Christian approaches to theology.
    - Both **Biblical and Systematic Theology** must be conducted from within a **Reformed worldview**.
    - Neutrality in theological method is impossible; all reasoning is covenantally determined.
    - The goal is to develop a consistently **Christian philosophy of life**.
    - "There is no neutrality; all theology is either for or against the God of Scripture." (Christian-Theistic Evidences)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s integration of **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** profoundly shaped Reformed theological method, emphasizing their mutual dependence and the necessity of presupposing the **authority of Scripture**. His insistence on the **antithesis** between Christian and non-Christian thought influenced generations of theologians and apologists. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of **presuppositional apologetics** and the Reformed commitment to a unified, redemptive-historical approach to theology.
