# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—constitute the foundational confessional standards of the continental **Reformed tradition**. While not distinguishing **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** in modern terms, these documents demonstrate a robust commitment to the unity and sufficiency of **Scripture** and the necessity of doctrinal formulation for the life and faith of the church.

- "We believe that this Holy Scripture contains the will of God completely and that everything one must believe to be saved is sufficiently taught in it." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561)
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563)
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619)
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole and Sufficient Authority**
    - Scripture is the only **normative source** for doctrine and life.
    - All theological formulations must be grounded in the **whole counsel of God**.
    - The confessions affirm the **clarity** and **sufficiency** of Scripture.
    - The unity of Scripture is foundational for both doctrinal synthesis and redemptive-historical reading.
    "We receive all these books, and these only, as holy and canonical, for the regulation, foundation, and confirmation of our faith." (Belgic Confession, Article 5)

2. **Organic Unity of Redemptive History**
    - The confessions trace the **covenant of grace** from Old to New Testament.
    - They emphasize the unfolding of **salvation history** culminating in Christ.
    - Theological categories are rooted in the progressive revelation of God’s promises.
    - The unity of the people of God across the testaments is a recurring theme.
    "The covenant that He made with our fathers, He has fulfilled in His Son Jesus Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 19)

3. **Necessity of Doctrinal Formulation**
    - The confessions systematize biblical teaching for clarity and defense of the faith.
    - They provide a **catechetical structure** for teaching and worship.
    - Systematic categories (e.g., **Trinity**, **justification**, **sacraments**) are explicitly defined.
    - Theological synthesis serves the unity and purity of the church.
    "We believe that we ought diligently and with modesty to read and meditate on them." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

4. **Christ-Centered Interpretation**
    - Christ is presented as the center and fulfillment of all Scripture.
    - The confessions interpret both testaments in light of the person and work of Christ.
    - Typology and promise-fulfillment are key hermeneutical tools.
    - The unity of biblical revelation is seen in the centrality of Christ for salvation.
    "The holy gospel...was first revealed in Paradise...and afterwards published by the patriarchs and prophets, and foreshadowed by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 19)

5. **Integration of Exegesis and Doctrine**
    - The confessions model careful use of **biblical exegesis** to support doctrinal statements.
    - They cite Scripture extensively to ground each article and answer.
    - There is no dichotomy between the historical unfolding of revelation and its doctrinal summary.
    - Theological reflection is always tethered to the text of Scripture.
    "We believe that those Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the **Reformed tradition’s** understanding of the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** by modeling a confessional approach that unites redemptive-historical reading with doctrinal synthesis. Their influence endures in Reformed churches worldwide, providing a paradigm for integrating exegesis and theology. The confessions continue to serve as a touchstone for discussions on the unity and diversity of Scripture and the necessity of doctrinal clarity for the church’s faith and practice.
