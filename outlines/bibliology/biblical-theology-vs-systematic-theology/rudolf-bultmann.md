# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann distinguished sharply between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**, insisting that the former must focus on the existential message of the **kerygma** as encountered in the New Testament, while the latter often imposes later doctrinal frameworks onto the biblical witness. For Bultmann, authentic theology arises from the **existential encounter** with the biblical text, not from abstract doctrinal synthesis, and he famously advocated for **demythologization** to recover the existential core of Christian proclamation.

- "Biblical theology seeks to interpret the New Testament message as it was intended, not as it has been systematized by later dogmatics." (History and Eschatology)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Kerygma in Biblical Theology**
   - The core of **Biblical Theology** is the proclamation (kerygma) of Christ, not doctrinal systems.
   - The New Testament must be interpreted as a witness to existential encounter, not as a sourcebook for dogmatic theology.
   - The kerygma addresses the hearer’s existence and calls for decision.
   - Systematic Theology tends to obscure the original existential message.
   - "The task of biblical theology is to interpret the kerygma, not to construct a system." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Demythologization as Hermeneutical Method**
   - The biblical message is clothed in mythological language that must be interpreted existentially.
   - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential truth behind the myth.
   - Systematic Theology often reifies myth rather than interpreting it.
   - True understanding comes from existential engagement, not doctrinal formulation.
   - "What matters is not the mythological world picture but the existential understanding of human existence." (New Testament and Mythology)

3. **Historical-Critical Approach to Scripture**
   - Biblical Theology requires rigorous historical-critical analysis to discern the original message.
   - Systematic Theology often neglects the historical context of biblical texts.
   - The meaning of Scripture is found in its historical situation and existential address.
   - Theological systems risk anachronism by reading later dogma into the text.
   - "The historical method is indispensable for understanding the biblical message." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Existential Interpretation over Doctrinal Synthesis**
   - Theology must interpret the biblical message in terms of existential self-understanding.
   - Systematic Theology tends to abstract and universalize, losing the personal address.
   - Faith is an existential response, not assent to a system of doctrine.
   - The New Testament calls for decision, not intellectual agreement with a system.
   - "Faith is not assent to propositions but an existential self-understanding." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Critique of Dogmatic Systematization**
   - Systematic Theology imposes foreign categories onto the biblical witness.
   - Dogmatic systems often distort the dynamic and existential nature of the biblical message.
   - Theological reflection must remain open to the challenge of the biblical text.
   - The task of theology is proclamation, not system-building.
   - "Dogmatics must not replace the living word with a system of thought." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s distinction between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **hermeneutics** and existential interpretation. His method of **demythologization** sparked ongoing debate about the relationship between historical context, existential meaning, and doctrinal formulation. While often criticized by confessional traditions, Bultmann’s work remains foundational for discussions on the nature and task of theology in the modern world. His influence endures in both biblical studies and contemporary theological method.
