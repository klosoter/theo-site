# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** by grounding theology in the **religious consciousness** and experience of the Christian community. He prioritized the **feeling of absolute dependence** as the core of religious life, viewing **dogmatics** as a descriptive account of the faith of the church rather than a deductive system from Scripture alone, thus challenging traditional Reformed distinctions between the two disciplines.

- "Dogmatics is the science which presents the Christian faith in its essence as it exists at the present time in all those who are filled with the Christian spirit." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
   - Theology arises from the **feeling of absolute dependence** within the Christian community.
   - Doctrines are expressions of communal religious consciousness, not abstract propositions.
   - **Systematic Theology** organizes these expressions, rather than deducing them from biblical texts.
   - **Biblical Theology** is seen as historical, while dogmatics is normative for the present church.
   - "Dogmatics is a historical science, for it presents the faith as it is found in the Christian community." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Distinction Between Historical and Systematic Tasks**
   - **Biblical Theology** reconstructs the beliefs of biblical authors in their historical context.
   - **Systematic Theology** articulates the faith of the contemporary church.
   - The two disciplines serve different purposes and should not be conflated.
   - Schleiermacher resists subordinating dogmatics to exegesis alone.
   - "The task of dogmatics is not to repeat the biblical writers, but to set forth the faith of the church." (Brief Outline)

3. **Doctrine as Description, Not Prescription**
   - Doctrines describe the self-understanding of the Christian community.
   - They are not timeless truths derived solely from Scripture.
   - Theological statements are shaped by the community’s ongoing experience.
   - This approach relativizes the authority of **Biblical Theology** for dogmatics.
   - "Dogmatic theology is a descriptive science, not a prescriptive one." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Organic Unity of Theology**
   - Theology is an organic whole, integrating **historical**, **practical**, and **systematic** elements.
   - Theological disciplines are interrelated, not isolated.
   - **Systematic Theology** synthesizes insights from **Biblical Theology** and church life.
   - Emphasizes the dynamic development of doctrine within the community.
   - "Theology is a living unity, not a collection of separate sciences." (Brief Outline)

5. **Scripture as Witness, Not Foundation**
   - Scripture is the historical witness to the original Christian experience.
   - Its authority is mediated through the ongoing life of the church.
   - **Systematic Theology** interprets Scripture in light of contemporary faith.
   - The Bible is not a static sourcebook for doctrine but a record of religious consciousness.
   - "Scripture is the original document of the Christian faith, but not its sole foundation." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** profoundly shaped modern Protestant thought, especially by emphasizing the role of **religious experience** and the community’s self-understanding. His distinction between historical and systematic tasks influenced later liberal theology and the development of **historical-critical methods**. While his views were critiqued by confessional theologians, his legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature and method of theology within the academy and the church.
