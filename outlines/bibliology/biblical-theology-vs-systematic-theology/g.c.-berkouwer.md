# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** with a strong emphasis on the dynamic, historical character of **revelation** and the necessity of theological reflection that remains faithful to the **Scriptures**. He argued that while **Systematic Theology** seeks coherence and doctrinal synthesis, it must always be rooted in the unfolding witness of **Biblical Theology**, avoiding speculative abstraction and maintaining a posture of continual reform under the authority of the Word.

- "Systematic theology must constantly be reformed and corrected by the witness of Scripture itself." (Studies in Dogmatics: Holy Scripture)

- The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Scripture in Theology**
    - Scripture is the foundational norm for all theological reflection.
    - Both **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** must submit to the authority of the biblical text.
    - Theological systems are always provisional and subject to correction by Scripture.
    - The unity of theology is found in its continual return to the biblical witness.
    - "Theology must always be open to the correction and guidance of the Word." (Holy Scripture)

2. **Historical Character of Revelation**
    - Revelation unfolds within redemptive history, not as abstract propositions.
    - **Biblical Theology** traces the progressive self-disclosure of God.
    - **Systematic Theology** must respect the historical progression of revelation.
    - Theological synthesis should not flatten or ignore the diversity within Scripture.
    - "Revelation is not a static deposit but a living, historical reality." (Faith and Revelation)

3. **Critical Role of Dogmatics**
    - **Systematic Theology** (dogmatics) is necessary for articulating the faith of the church.
    - Dogmatics must avoid speculative systems detached from Scripture.
    - The task of dogmatics is to serve the church’s confession, not to dominate it.
    - Dogmatics is always in dialogue with **Biblical Theology** and exegesis.
    - "Dogmatics is not the master but the servant of the Word." (Holy Scripture)

4. **Mutual Correction between Disciplines**
    - **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** are interdependent.
    - Each discipline corrects and enriches the other in the pursuit of truth.
    - Systematic reflection guards against fragmentation; biblical study guards against abstraction.
    - Theological humility is required to maintain this mutual correction.
    - "There is a constant interplay between exegesis and dogmatics." (Faith and Revelation)

5. **Rejection of Artificial Separation**
    - Berkouwer opposed a rigid division between **Biblical** and **Systematic Theology**.
    - Both disciplines are united in their service to the church’s understanding of revelation.
    - Artificial separation leads to either doctrinal sterility or exegetical fragmentation.
    - True theology integrates biblical exegesis and doctrinal synthesis.
    - "Theology loses its vitality when it separates itself from the living voice of Scripture." (Holy Scripture)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s insistence on the **primacy of Scripture** and the dynamic interplay between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** has profoundly shaped Reformed theological method. His work encouraged a posture of humility, continual reform, and attentiveness to the unfolding character of revelation. Berkouwer’s legacy endures in his call for theology that is both confessional and exegetical, always seeking to serve the church under the authority of the Word.
