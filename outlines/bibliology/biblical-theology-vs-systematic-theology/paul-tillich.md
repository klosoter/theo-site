# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** through his method of **correlation**, seeking to relate the existential questions of human existence to the answers provided by the **Christian message**. He viewed **Systematic Theology** as a discipline that interprets the symbols and narratives of **Biblical revelation** in light of contemporary philosophical and existential concerns, rather than as a mere summary of biblical content. For Tillich, the task of theology is to mediate between the **kerygma** and the modern situation, making the biblical message intelligible and relevant.

- "Systematic theology has to demonstrate the truth of the Christian message for our time." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- Theology of Culture
- The Interpretation of History
- Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality
- Dynamics of Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Method of Correlation**
    - Theology must relate existential human questions to the answers found in the Christian message.
    - **Systematic Theology** interprets biblical symbols in dialogue with contemporary philosophy.
    - The method avoids a simple repetition of biblical content, seeking instead meaningful engagement.
    - Correlation is a two-way process: both human situation and biblical message are mutually illuminating.
    - "The method of correlation explains the contents of the Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers in mutual interdependence." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

2. **Primacy of Existential Questions**
    - Theology begins with the existential situation of the human person.
    - **Biblical Theology** provides symbols and narratives that address these fundamental concerns.
    - Theological reflection must be relevant to the anxieties and crises of the present age.
    - The existential approach shapes how biblical material is appropriated in systematic construction.
    - "The existential situation provides the questions to which the Christian message is the answer." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

3. **Symbolic Nature of Revelation**
    - **Biblical revelation** is mediated through symbols, not direct propositional statements.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point, making them suitable for theological interpretation.
    - Systematic Theology interprets these symbols for contemporary understanding.
    - The symbolic character of revelation bridges the gap between ancient texts and modern experience.
    - "All religious language is symbolic, and its symbols must be interpreted in each new situation." (Dynamics of Faith)

4. **Systematic Theology as Interpretive, Not Repetitive**
    - Systematic Theology does not simply restate biblical content but interprets it for today.
    - The task is constructive, engaging both the biblical witness and philosophical analysis.
    - Theological systems must be open to revision as new existential questions arise.
    - The unity of theology is achieved through the integration of biblical symbols and systematic reflection.
    - "Systematic theology must interpret the symbols of faith in terms of contemporary thought." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

5. **Integration of Philosophy and Theology**
    - Philosophy provides the conceptual tools for theological articulation.
    - Theology must engage with philosophical currents to remain intellectually credible.
    - The relationship is dialogical, not subordinate; both disciplines inform each other.
    - Theological method is enriched by philosophical analysis of existence, being, and meaning.
    - "Theology must use the concepts of philosophy in order to express the meaning of the Christian symbols." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially through his **method of correlation**. His insistence on the existential relevance of theology and the symbolic interpretation of revelation opened new avenues for dialogue between theology and philosophy. While some critics argue that his method risks subordinating biblical content to contemporary concerns, Tillich’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to make Christian theology meaningful in a secular age. His legacy endures in both academic theology and broader discussions of faith and culture.
