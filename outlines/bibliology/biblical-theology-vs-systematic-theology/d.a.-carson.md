# D.A. Carson (1946–)

D.A. Carson is a leading evangelical scholar who has written extensively on the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**. He emphasizes that **Biblical Theology** traces the progressive unfolding of **redemptive history**, while **Systematic Theology** synthesizes and articulates the coherent doctrinal structure of **Scripture** as a whole. Carson insists that a robust theological method requires the interplay of both approaches for faithful interpretation and application.

- "Biblical theology is inductive, focusing on the unfolding storyline, while systematic theology is more deductive, organizing themes across the canon." (Collected Writings on Scripture)

## Key Works

- "New Dictionary of Biblical Theology" (editor, with T. Desmond Alexander)
- "The Gagging of God: Christianity Confronts Pluralism"
- "Collected Writings on Scripture"
- "For the Love of God" (devotional, with biblical-theological reflections)
- "The Enduring Authority of the Christian Scriptures" (contributor)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Biblical Theology as Historical and Redemptive**
    - Emphasizes the unfolding of **God’s redemptive plan** through history.
    - Focuses on the literary and historical context of biblical texts.
    - Traces themes and motifs as they develop across the canon.
    - Seeks to understand each passage within its place in the storyline of **Scripture**.
    "Biblical theology seeks to trace the Bible’s own story line and the development of its themes." (New Dictionary of Biblical Theology)

2. **Systematic Theology as Synthesis**
    - Organizes biblical data into coherent doctrinal categories.
    - Seeks to answer contemporary questions with the whole counsel of **Scripture**.
    - Employs philosophical and logical tools for clarity and consistency.
    - Builds upon the results of **Biblical Theology** for doctrinal formulation.
    "Systematic theology asks, ‘What does the whole Bible say about x?’" (Collected Writings on Scripture)

3. **Mutual Necessity and Interdependence**
    - Argues that neither discipline is sufficient alone for faithful theology.
    - Warns against divorcing **Biblical Theology** from doctrinal synthesis.
    - Insists that **Systematic Theology** must remain tethered to the biblical storyline.
    - Advocates for a dialogical relationship between the two disciplines.
    "Biblical and systematic theology need each other, lest either drift into distortion." (The Gagging of God)

4. **Primacy of Scripture**
    - Upholds the **authority** and **sufficiency** of the biblical text.
    - Both disciplines must submit to the text’s meaning and intent.
    - Rejects approaches that impose external frameworks on **Scripture**.
    - Encourages humility before the diversity and unity of the canon.
    "The Bible must control both our biblical and systematic theologies." (Collected Writings on Scripture)

5. **Theological Method and Hermeneutics**
    - Stresses the importance of sound **hermeneutical principles**.
    - Recognizes the role of presuppositions in theological formulation.
    - Encourages continual reform of theology in light of **Scripture**.
    - Values both historical exegesis and contemporary application.
    "Our theological method must be self-correcting as we listen afresh to the text." (The Enduring Authority of the Christian Scriptures)

## Legacy and Impact

D.A. Carson has significantly shaped evangelical understanding of the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**, urging scholars and pastors to integrate both disciplines for faithful exposition and doctrinal clarity. His work has influenced the resurgence of **redemptive-historical preaching** and the development of evangelical biblical theology. Carson’s insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and methodological rigor continues to guide theological education and scholarship worldwide.
