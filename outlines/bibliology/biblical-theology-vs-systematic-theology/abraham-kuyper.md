# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper distinguished between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** by emphasizing their unique roles within the broader discipline of **theological science**. He saw **Biblical Theology** as the historical unfolding of **revelation**, while **Systematic Theology** organizes and synthesizes the truths of **Scripture** into a coherent doctrinal system. Kuyper insisted that both disciplines are necessary for a robust and faithful understanding of **Christian doctrine**.

- "Dogmatics does not derive its material from the dogmas of the church, but from the Holy Scriptures." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

- Principles of Sacred Theology (De beginselen der Heilige Theologie, 1894)
- Lectures on Calvinism (1898)
- Pro Rege (1911–1912)
- Our Worship (1911)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinct Roles of Biblical and Systematic Theology**
    - Biblical Theology traces the progressive revelation of God in history.
    - Systematic Theology arranges biblical data into a logical, doctrinal system.
    - Both disciplines are interdependent but serve different purposes.
    - The unity of theology is preserved by respecting each discipline’s unique method.
    - "Biblical theology investigates the facts of revelation; dogmatics arranges them into a system." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Primacy of Revelation**
    - All theology is grounded in the self-disclosure of God through Scripture.
    - Revelation is historical, organic, and unfolds progressively.
    - Systematic Theology must always be subordinate to the authority of revelation.
    - Theological systems are valid only insofar as they reflect the biblical witness.
    - "Revelation is the principle of theology, and Scripture is its source." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

3. **Organic Unity of Scripture**
    - Scripture is a unified organism, not a collection of isolated texts.
    - Both Biblical and Systematic Theology must account for the coherence of the biblical canon.
    - The organic unity shapes how doctrines are formulated and understood.
    - Theological reflection must respect the interconnectedness of biblical themes.
    - "The Scriptures form an organic unity, and theology must reflect this unity." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

4. **Theological Science as a Vocation**
    - Theology is a rigorous, scientific discipline with its own principles and methods.
    - The theologian’s task is to serve the church by faithfully interpreting revelation.
    - Both Biblical and Systematic Theology require spiritual discernment and scholarly rigor.
    - Theological work is a calling under the lordship of Christ.
    - "Theology is a science, but it is a science of the things of God." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

5. **Antithesis and Worldview**
    - Kuyper’s doctrine of the antithesis shapes his approach to theology.
    - Theological method is influenced by one’s presuppositions and worldview.
    - Christian theology stands in contrast to non-Christian systems of thought.
    - Both Biblical and Systematic Theology must be consciously rooted in a Reformed worldview.
    - "There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ... does not cry, 'Mine!'" (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s distinction between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** has profoundly influenced Reformed theological method, especially in emphasizing the organic unity and historical development of **revelation**. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the necessity of a consciously Christian worldview continues to shape theological education and scholarship. Kuyper’s approach laid groundwork for later Neo-Calvinist and Reformed thinkers, reinforcing the importance of both disciplines for a comprehensive and faithful theology.
