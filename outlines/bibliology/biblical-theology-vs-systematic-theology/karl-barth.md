# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth distinguished **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** as distinct yet inseparable disciplines within the task of **Dogmatics**. For Barth, **Biblical Theology** attends to the witness of **Scripture** in its historical and literary forms, while **Systematic Theology** seeks to articulate the **Church’s doctrine** in response to the living **Word of God**. He insisted that both must remain in constant dialogue, with **revelation** as their common ground.

- "Dogmatics is the scientific self-examination of the Christian Church with respect to the content of its distinctive talk about God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics, esp. I/1 and I/2
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- The Epistle to the Romans
- The Theology of Karl Barth (ed. H. Gollwitzer)
- Karl Barth: A New Introduction to His Theology (by Cornelius van der Kooi & Gijsbert van den Brink)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Revelation**
   - Theology must begin with **God’s self-revelation** in Jesus Christ.
   - Both Biblical and Systematic Theology are subordinate to the event of revelation.
   - Human reason and religious experience are insufficient starting points.
   - The **Word of God** is the criterion for all theological reflection.
   - "Revelation remains revelation, and theology must always be theology of revelation." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Unity of Scripture and Doctrine**
   - **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** are united by their orientation to the same divine subject.
   - Doctrine must be grounded in the witness of **Scripture**.
   - Theological construction is not independent from biblical exegesis.
   - The Church’s confession arises from the biblical narrative.
   - "Dogmatics as a science is bound to Holy Scripture as its source and norm." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **Dialectical Relationship**
   - There is a necessary dialogue between exegesis and dogmatic formulation.
   - **Biblical Theology** provides the material content; **Systematic Theology** provides conceptual clarity.
   - Neither discipline can claim autonomy from the other.
   - Theological method is inherently dialectical, reflecting the tension of divine and human.
   - "Theology must always be both exegetical and systematic, never one without the other." (Evangelical Theology)

4. **Christocentric Focus**
   - All theology centers on the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
   - Both disciplines must interpret Scripture in light of Christ.
   - **Systematic Theology** is not abstract speculation but proclamation of Christ.
   - The unity of the Bible is found in its witness to Christ.
   - "Jesus Christ is the one Word of God which we have to hear and which we have to trust and obey in life and in death." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

5. **Theological Humility and Provisionality**
   - All theological statements are provisional and subject to correction by the Word.
   - **Systematic Theology** must listen to the ongoing witness of Scripture.
   - The Church’s doctrine is always reformanda, in need of renewal.
   - The theologian stands under the authority of revelation, not above it.
   - "Theology is not a closed system but an open question addressed to the Word of God." (Evangelical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s approach to the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** reshaped twentieth-century Protestant thought, emphasizing the centrality of **revelation** and the necessity of grounding doctrine in the witness of Scripture. His insistence on a **Christocentric** and dialectical method influenced generations of theologians and contributed to the renewal of dogmatic theology. Barth’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the proper relationship between exegesis and doctrinal formulation within the Reformed tradition and beyond.
