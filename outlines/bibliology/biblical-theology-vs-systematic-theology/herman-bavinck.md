# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck distinguished between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** while emphasizing their essential unity within the Reformed tradition. He argued that **Biblical Theology** traces the progressive revelation of **redemptive history**, whereas **Systematic Theology** organizes the doctrines of Scripture into a coherent, logical system, always grounded in the **organic unity of revelation**.

- "Dogmatics does not derive its content from philosophical systems, but from the organism of the special revelation which has reached its full growth in Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.86)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics (4 vols.)
- Philosophy of Revelation
- "The Science of Holy Theology" (essay in Essays on Religion, Science, and Society)
- Our Reasonable Faith
- "General and Special Revelation" (in Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
   - Revelation unfolds progressively but is always unified in Christ.
   - Both **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** must respect the organic structure of Scripture.
   - The unity of Scripture prevents fragmentation between historical and doctrinal approaches.
   - Theological reflection must be rooted in the totality of biblical revelation.
   - "Revelation is an organic whole, and dogmatics must do justice to its unity." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.87)

2. **Distinct but Complementary Disciplines**
   - **Biblical Theology** focuses on the historical progression of revelation.
   - **Systematic Theology** arranges doctrines topically and logically.
   - Each discipline serves the other; neither is sufficient alone.
   - The distinction guards against reductionism in both directions.
   - "Biblical theology and dogmatics are not opposed but mutually dependent." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.89)

3. **Primacy of Scripture**
   - Both disciplines are subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
   - **Systematic Theology** must not impose foreign categories on the biblical text.
   - **Biblical Theology** must not neglect the confessional synthesis of doctrine.
   - The **self-attesting character of Scripture** guides theological method.
   - "The dogmatician must be bound to Scripture as the only norm and source." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.84)

4. **Historical Development of Doctrine**
   - Doctrine develops as the church reflects on the unfolding of revelation.
   - **Biblical Theology** traces this development within the canon.
   - **Systematic Theology** articulates the mature fruit of this process.
   - The history of doctrine is integral to understanding systematic formulations.
   - "Dogmatics is possible only because revelation has a history." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.90)

5. **Theological Synthesis in Service of the Church**
   - **Systematic Theology** serves the church by providing doctrinal clarity.
   - The synthesis of biblical data aids proclamation, teaching, and defense of the faith.
   - Theological construction must be ecclesial, not merely academic.
   - The end of theology is the glory of God and the edification of believers.
   - "Theology is a science, but it is also a confession of the church." (Reformed Dogmatics, I.45)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s careful distinction and integration of **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** shaped twentieth-century Reformed thought, influencing figures like Vos and Berkouwer. His emphasis on the **organic unity of revelation** continues to inform contemporary theological method. Bavinck’s work remains a standard for those seeking to uphold both the historical progression and doctrinal coherence of Scripture within the church.
