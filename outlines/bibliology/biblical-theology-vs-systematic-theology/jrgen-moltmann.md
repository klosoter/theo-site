# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** through the lens of **eschatology** and the dynamic unfolding of **God’s self-disclosure** in history. He insists that theology must remain open to the future-oriented character of revelation, allowing the **biblical narrative** and its promise to continually renew systematic reflection.

- "Theology must always be open to the future of the biblical promise, and not close itself off in the system of its own concepts." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- Experiences in Theology: Ways and Forms of Christian Theology (2000)
- God in Creation (1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Eschatology in Theology**
    - **Eschatology** shapes all theological reflection, not just a separate locus.
    - The future promise of God drives both biblical interpretation and doctrinal formulation.
    - **Systematic Theology** must remain open to the ongoing fulfillment of biblical hope.
    - The unity of theology is found in the forward movement of God’s redemptive plan.
    - "From first to last, and not merely in the epilogue, Christianity is eschatology." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Dynamic Relationship Between Scripture and Doctrine**
    - **Biblical Theology** provides the narrative and promise that Systematic Theology must interpret.
    - Doctrines are provisional, shaped by the ongoing encounter with the biblical witness.
    - **Systematic Theology** is a continual process, not a closed system.
    - Theological concepts must be reformulated in light of new readings of Scripture.
    - "Dogmatics must be open to the future of the biblical message." (Experiences in Theology)

3. **Revelation as Historical and Open-Ended**
    - **Revelation** unfolds in history and is not exhausted by past events.
    - The Bible testifies to God’s acts, which point beyond themselves to future fulfillment.
    - **Systematic Theology** must avoid reducing revelation to timeless truths.
    - The openness of revelation challenges static theological systems.
    - "Revelation is the opening of a future horizon in history." (Theology of Hope)

4. **Critique of Closed Systems**
    - **Systematic Theology** risks becoming self-referential and detached from Scripture.
    - Theological systems must be critiqued by the ongoing witness of the biblical text.
    - The future orientation of biblical hope resists finality in doctrine.
    - Theology should be dialogical, engaging with the living Word.
    - "A theology which closes itself off in its own system loses the power of hope." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Integration of Praxis and Theological Reflection**
    - Theology is not merely theoretical but calls for transformation in history.
    - **Biblical Theology** inspires hope that leads to action in the world.
    - **Systematic Theology** must address contemporary realities in light of biblical promise.
    - The unity of theology is found in its engagement with the world’s suffering and hope.
    - "Theology is practical in that it is oriented to the transformation of the world." (The Crucified God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach has significantly influenced the dialogue between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**, especially through his emphasis on **eschatology** and the openness of revelation. His work has encouraged theologians to resist static doctrinal systems and to allow the biblical narrative to continually reshape theological reflection. Moltmann’s integration of hope, praxis, and the future orientation of theology has left a lasting mark on both academic and ecclesial contexts, challenging theologians to keep their work responsive to the living Word.
