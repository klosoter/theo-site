### TITLE
One Bible, Two Sciences? Reintegrating Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology under the Canon

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether and how **biblical theology** and **systematic theology** constitute distinct yet integrated sciences under the one canon, and what that implies for method, normativity, and theological construction.
- Decisive figures: Geerhardus Vos, B. B. Warfield, Gerhard Ebeling, Brevard Childs, and G. K. Beale.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed dogmatics and **federal theology**, classic Lutheran and Reformed exegesis, twentieth‑century German biblical and hermeneutical theology, canonical‑critical approaches, and contemporary evangelical biblical theology.
- Debates addressed:
  - Internal: Within Reformed and evangelical circles, the proper ordering of **redemptive‑historical exegesis** and **systematic construction**, and the status of biblical theology as distinct discipline or servant of dogmatics.
  - External: Historical‑critical and existentialist reconstructions that oppose biblical theology to dogmatics, and Roman Catholic models that subordinate biblical theology to magisterial **dogma**.
  - Contemporary: Canonical vs. purely historical biblical theology, theological interpretation of Scripture, and the fragmentation of theological disciplines in the academy and church.
- Defended position: Biblical theology and systematic theology are distinct formal operations on the one **canonical Word of God**, but they are mutually implicating and must be reintegrated under a confessional, canonical, redemptive‑historical stance, with systematic theology functioning as the architectonic discipline that receives, orders, and normatively articulates the results of biblical theology in service of the church.

### ESSAY
The examination question about biblical theology versus systematic theology presses immediately on how one conceives the unity of the Bible, the nature of theology as a science, and the relation between exegesis and confession. Behind the methodological vocabulary lies a simple but searching issue: is there one theological use of Scripture, with different moments of attention, or are we really dealing with rival enterprises, one historically descriptive and the other dogmatically constructive, whose conclusions may diverge? My thesis is that biblical theology and systematic theology are formally distinct but materially inseparable modes of attending to the one canon. Biblical theology traces the progressive, **redemptive‑historical** unfolding of God’s self‑revelation within the covenantal economy; systematic theology receives that same revelation in its canonical completion and, under the rule of **analogia fidei**, orders it architectonically for the faith and life of the church. Any attempt to absolutize either discipline against the other compromises either the historicity of revelation or the unity and normativity of doctrine.

To defend this, we must situate the modern debate historically. At Westminster Theological Seminary, names like Geerhardus Vos and B. B. Warfield are unavoidable because they represent a self‑consciously Reformed attempt to develop a distinctive biblical theology without capitulating to the anti‑dogmatic impulses of nineteenth‑century German scholarship. Vos in particular is decisive. Working at the turn of the twentieth century, in the wake of J. P. Gabler’s famous lecture distinguishing biblical from dogmatic theology, Vos accepts that there is a legitimate discipline one may call biblical theology that traces the history of special revelation, but he refuses the implication that this discipline can be normatively independent of confessional truth. For Vos, biblical theology is simply theology viewed in its historic progression, the unfolding of God’s self‑disclosure through the successive epochs of **covenant** administration, climaxing in Christ. It is not a neutral, autonomous historical study but an internal description of the Bible’s own redemptive movement. His Biblical Theology and his essays on the nature of biblical theology make this clear: the content of biblical theology is still the self‑revelation of the triune God, not a phenomenology of religious experiences.

Vos’s method is marked by several commitments that shape the entire Reformed discussion. First, the unity of Scripture is grounded in the unity of the **covenant of grace** and in the one Logos who speaks throughout the diverse epochs. Second, revelation is intrinsically historical and organically progressive. This is a direct challenge to any notion that systematic theology alone delivers “timeless truths” abstracted from history. Third, Vos is insistent that biblical theology is distinct from but not opposed to systematic theology. It is a different angle of vision: one moves along the axis of history, the other along the axis of logical construction. An examiner will often press here: does that not concede the basic point of the German historicists, namely that biblical theology is a descriptive, historical discipline and systematic theology a constructive, dogmatic one, and therefore that the former has priority for what the Bible actually teaches? Vos’s answer, which I defend, is that the distinction is formal, not material. The content is one and the same divine revelation. The difference lies in the question we ask: either “what is God revealing at this historical point in the economy, and how does that move the story forward” or “what does the whole canonical revelation teach on this doctrinal matter when read as a completed unity.” To absolutize the former into an autonomous norm is to make the history of religions the final court of appeal rather than the canon as canon.

B. B. Warfield, Vos’s contemporary, must be treated alongside him, not because he develops a full biblical theology of his own, but because his doctrine of Scripture and his view of **dogmatics** set the context for the relation between the disciplines. Warfield’s classic definition of theology as the science that draws its conclusions from the facts of Scripture as apprehended by the regenerated mind makes two critical points. First, systematic theology is genuinely a science: it has a determinate object, the Triune God and his works as revealed in Scripture, and it forms structured, inferential judgments from the biblical data. Second, those biblical “facts” are not bare historical occurrences but divinely interpreted events as inscripturated and canonically located. Warfield’s robust **inerrancy** and **inspiration** doctrine thus underwrites the view that systematic theology is not an external imposition upon Scripture but the internal elaboration of Scripture’s own teaching.

The internal debate here, especially in a Westminster context, often centers on the suspicion that systematic theology can become a Procrustean bed, flattening the Bible’s redemptive‑historical richness into timeless propositions. Examiners sometimes contrast Warfield’s doctrinal rigor with Vos’s dynamic sense of redemptive history. Does Warfield’s strong doctrine of Scripture encourage a proof‑texting approach that sidelines biblical theology? In defending their fundamental compatibility, one must stress that Warfield’s emphasis on the “facts” of Scripture assumes that those facts include the historical shape of revelation. The “data” are not isolated verses but covenantal structures, typologies, and epochs. Properly understood, Warfield’s doctrine of Scripture requires, rather than marginalizes, a Vosian biblical theology as the disciplined way of identifying what counts as a biblical “fact” in its canonical and historical setting. Conversely, biblical theology without Warfield’s strong view of inspiration risks collapsing into general religious history or a narrative‑only account without dogmatic stability.

If Vos and Warfield represent an integrated Reformed response, Gerhard Ebeling represents a crucial external alternative. Working out of post‑Bultmannian German Lutheranism, Ebeling famously charged that dogmatics had distorted the gospel by freezing it into timeless propositions detached from the living address of God in Scripture. For Ebeling, “biblical theology” becomes a hermeneutical enterprise that retrieves the original proclamation event behind the texts and refuses to let later dogma dictate meaning. The word of God is not first a deposit of truths but an existential event of address that must be re‑actualized in every generation. Systematic theology as classically practiced is thus suspect, because it imposes alien conceptual schemes on the biblical kerygma.

Ebeling’s critique sharpened a tension already latent since Gabler: either biblical theology is a descriptive, historically conditioned account of what Israel and the early church believed, or dogmatics asserts what the church now must confess. On his view, any strong **analogia fidei** principle runs the risk of allowing later ecclesial constructions to silence the historically situated word. Examiners may press: does not the Reformed appeal to confessions and systematic categories vindicate Ebeling’s worries, rendering biblical exegesis subordinate to dogmatic control? My response leans on Vos and Warfield: first, the Reformed position insists on the primacy of the canon over all confessions, precisely because the canon itself is the final form of divine discourse. Second, Reformed dogmatics is not a second Bible laid over the first, but the church’s fallible and revisable attempt to state what the whole canon teaches when read as a coherent unity. The **regulative authority** remains the canonical Word, not the confession. Third, Ebeling’s own position undermines the stability of the gospel, since a shifting existential event cannot function as a doctrinal norm. If what counts as “the word of God” is perpetually relative to the contemporary encounter, then biblical theology can no longer serve as the determinate voice of Christ for the church.

Between these poles stands Brevard Childs, whose canonical approach has significantly influenced contemporary evangelical and Reformed discussion. Childs was reacting, in part, to the fragmentation of Scripture into sources and strata in historical‑critical scholarship, as well as to the disconnect between exegesis and theology. His canonical theology insisted that the proper object of both biblical and systematic theology is the final form of the canon as received by the church, and that the task of theology is to hear within that canon a coherent **rule of faith**. Childs refused both a naive proof‑texting dogmatics and a purely descriptive biblical theology. He pled for a theological exegesis that took seriously both the historical development of the texts and their canonical shape as a normative whole.

Childs contributed two vital insights to the biblical versus systematic theology debate. First, he denied that biblical theology could be a purely historical, “value free” account of ancient religion. Any act of selecting, organizing, and synthesizing biblical material already presupposes theological judgments about coherence and normativity. Attempts to bracket dogmatic questions in favor of neutrality are illusory. Second, he argued that systematic theology must be “canonical‑constrained,” that is, its conceptual moves must track with the contours, genres, and emphases of the biblical canon, rather than importing alien metaphysical or ideological schemes. This aligns closely with the Reformed insistence on **Scripture principle** and **sola Scriptura** understood as the sufficiency and finality of the canon. At the same time, Childs remained wary of confessional systems that seemed to close off fresh hearing of the text.

A likely examiner’s objection at this point is whether the canonical approach itself simply replaces ecclesial dogma with a different kind of meta‑framework that predetermines meaning. If one privileges the “final form” of the canon, is one not already making a dogmatic decision about which texts and structures are normative and why? Here the Reformed response leans on the doctrine of providence and the Spirit’s work in the formation of the canon. The final form is not an arbitrary closure but the divinely willed shape in which Christ rules his church by his Word. Thus, to attend to the canon as canon is to attend to Christ’s self‑attestation. Both biblical and systematic theology must be canonical in this sense. My criticism of some versions of canonical theology, however, is that they can downplay the organizing role of dogmatic loci. Without a clear sense of **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **covenant** as structuring doctrines, canonical readings risk becoming thematic surveys without confessional backbone.

In contemporary evangelicalism, G. K. Beale exemplifies a retrieval of biblical theology in a way that self‑consciously serves systematic and confessional ends. Beale’s work on the New Testament use of the Old, on the temple theme, and on idolatry, models a disciplined tracing of typological and intertextual connections under the conviction that Scripture is a self‑interpreting, unified canon. His method is explicitly **analogical** and **redemptive‑historical**: later revelation fulfills, deepens, and sometimes reconfigures earlier revelation, yet never in contradiction. Beale also resists the false dichotomy between “story” and “doctrine.” His biblical theology is richly narrative, following the storyline from Eden to new creation, yet he constantly shows how this narrative yields and presupposes doctrinal judgments about God, sin, atonement, and eschatology. In this sense, Beale’s work is a practical demonstration that biblical theology, practiced canonically, cannot avoid systematic conclusions.

This leads to the central internal debate in Reformed circles: does biblical theology norm systematic theology, or vice versa, or are they mutually norming under the canon? Some, influenced by the redemptive‑historical homiletics associated with later Dutch Reformed preaching, have spoken as though biblical theology should radically reconfigure or even relativize the older Reformed systems. Others have reacted by subordinating biblical theology to an already fixed dogmatic scheme, using redemptive‑historical insights only to illustrate pre‑established loci. My defended position is that the norm is neither discipline as such but the canon as the Spirit’s instrument of Christ’s lordship. Biblical theology is the disciplined listening to the canon’s historical and literary progression; systematic theology is the disciplined stating of the canon’s whole teaching in conceptual form. They correct and enrich each other as distinct operations under a higher norm. Where a dogmatic formulation is found to be exegetically unsustainable in light of rigorous biblical theology, it must be revised. Where a proposed biblical‑theological theme undermines clear canonical teaching on, say, the **two natures of Christ** or **justification by faith**, it must be resisted as misreading.

External to the Reformed and evangelical milieu, Roman Catholic theology offers a contrasting ordering of these disciplines. In the post‑Tridentine and neo‑scholastic periods, there was little room for a freestanding biblical theology in the modern sense. Scripture was read substantially through the lens of dogma, and exegesis was tightly linked to settled magisterial teaching. In the twentieth century, especially after Divino Afflante Spiritu and Dei Verbum, Roman Catholicism encouraged historical‑critical exegesis and a kind of biblical theology, yet always under the final normative authority of the magisterium. The result is that biblical theology is formally subordinated to ecclesial dogma and tradition. For a Reformed position, this reveals a fundamental misordering: the church is under the Word, not over it, and the canon is the principium cognoscendi of theology. Thus, biblical theology cannot be a mere ancillary discipline under magisterial control; it is intrinsic to how the church hears her Lord. At the same time, the Catholic emphasis on the church’s role in recognizing and reading the canon reminds Reformed theologians that both biblical and systematic theology are ecclesial practices, not private scholarly games.

Contemporary debates about theological interpretation of Scripture and the fragmentation of the theological curriculum intensify the stakes of distinguishing and relating biblical and systematic theology. In many university settings, “biblical studies” has been practically severed from theology and confessional commitments, reduced to religious history or literary criticism. In reaction, the theological interpretation movement insists that exegesis must be explicitly theological, oriented to the triune God, the rule of faith, and the church’s worship. This movement often appeals to premodern exegesis and challenges the sharp modern division between descriptive biblical theology and constructive dogmatics. For a Westminster candidate, the challenge is to affirm the core insight of theological interpretation that there is no theologically neutral reading of Scripture, while retaining the gains of historical‑grammatical sensitivity and redemptive‑historical method. One must resist both a flattening scholasticism that reads texts only as proof‑texts, and a free‑form theological reading that ignores authorial intent and historical progression.

Examiners will likely ask whether maintaining a distinction between biblical and systematic theology simply re‑inscribes the problematic modern divide. Why not abolish the distinction altogether and speak only of “theology” or “theological exegesis”? The answer lies in the nature of **scientia**. Distinct formal questions and operations justify distinguishing sciences, even within a unified field. Biblical theology asks historically and literarily ordered questions: how has God revealed himself across the epochs, and how do later texts appropriate earlier ones? Systematic theology asks architectonic and inferential questions: what does the whole canon teach about God, man, Christ, salvation, church, and last things, and how do these doctrines cohere? Collapsing the disciplines obscures these necessary methodological foci. For example, one cannot responsibly articulate a doctrine of the Trinity without tracing historically how the New Testament reveals the Son and Spirit in relation to the Father, yet one also cannot stop at a descriptive account of early Christian beliefs. One must ask what the canon as a whole, read in light of **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations**, requires us to confess. That is a properly systematic act. Conversely, one cannot responsibly preach Romans without situating Paul’s argument within the unfolding of the Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants, which is a biblical‑theological act.

The final point that must be emphasized under oral examination is the pastoral and ecclesial telos of both disciplines. For Vos, Warfield, Childs, and Beale alike, theology is in service of the church’s hearing and confessing of Christ. If biblical theology degenerates into academic reconstruction of religious history, or systematic theology into speculative system building, both have forsaken their end. The Reformed tradition’s emphasis on **federal theology** shows this integration at work: the distinction of the covenants of works and grace, the progression from promise to fulfillment, the union of Christ and his people, all require biblical‑theological tracing of the storyline and systematic formulation of doctrinal conclusions. Preaching that is genuinely redemptive‑historical will not merely retell the story but press its doctrinal weight on hearers; catechesis that is genuinely doctrinal will continually tie each locus back into the unfolding of God’s covenantal dealings.

In defending an integrated but ordered relation between biblical and systematic theology, I therefore affirm: both are necessary, both are distinct, both are under the canon, and systematic theology, as the architectonic science of doctrine, has a certain regulative primacy in that it articulates the church’s confession in normative propositions. Yet that primacy is never independent of, nor corrective to, Scripture itself. It exists precisely in constant, repentant return to exegesis and biblical theology. Whenever systematic theology becomes rigidly self‑referential, biblical theology must function as a ministerial critique, exposing where the system has drifted from the canonical texture. Whenever biblical theology seduces scholars into endless description without confession, systematic theology must call them back to confess that “Jesus is Lord” has determinate doctrinal content.

The deeper unity beneath the “versus” language is the **unity of the canon in Christ**. The same Spirit who inspired the prophets and apostles gives the church teachers to expound that Word in all its dimensions. Biblical theology listens to the voice as it echoes across the ages of redemptive history; systematic theology confesses what that voice, in its completed canonical chorus, teaches us to believe and do. To drive a wedge between them is, in the end, to deny either that God speaks in history or that he binds us to the truth of his speech.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Biblical theology** is the disciplined tracing of God’s self‑revelation in its **redemptive‑historical** and canonical progression; **systematic theology** is the architectonic ordering and normative articulation of that same canonical revelation under the **analogia fidei** for the faith and life of the church.
- Decisive figures:
  - Geerhardus Vos: Reformed architect of biblical theology as a history of special revelation within **federal theology**, distinct from but coordinated with dogmatics.
  - B. B. Warfield: Defender of **inspiration** and theology as a science of Scripture’s “facts,” grounding systematic theology’s legitimacy and its dependence on canonically construed data.
  - Gerhard Ebeling: Post‑Bultmannian critic of dogmatics, recasting biblical theology as existential hermeneutics and opposing it to confessional systematics.
  - Brevard Childs: Canonical theologian insisting that both disciplines attend to the final form of Scripture and the **rule of faith**, resisting purely descriptive or purely speculative models.
  - G. K. Beale: Contemporary evangelical practitioner of biblical theology who integrates typology, canon, and doctrinal conclusions, modeling mutual service of exegesis and systematics.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Whether biblical theology should reshape or sit under Reformed systems; how to avoid both proof‑texting and narrative‑only approaches; which discipline has methodological priority.
  - External: Historicist and existentialist models that detach biblical theology from normativity; Roman Catholic subordination of biblical theology to magisterial **dogma**.
  - Contemporary: Theological interpretation of Scripture, the fragmentation of biblical studies from theology, canonical versus purely historical biblical theology.
- Defended position: Biblical and systematic theology are formally distinct but materially inseparable sciences under the one **canonical Word of God**; the canon, not either discipline, is the norming norm, with systematic theology serving as the church’s normative confession that must constantly be reformed by rigorous, redemptive‑historical biblical theology.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - Is biblical theology normatively prior to systematic theology?  
    No; the canon as canon is normatively prior, and both disciplines are subordinate operations on it.
  - Does the distinction between disciplines perpetuate an unbiblical split between story and doctrine?  
    No; it marks different formal questions, while affirming that the biblical story intrinsically yields doctrinal truth.
  - How do you prevent confessions from controlling exegesis illegitimately?  
    By treating confessions as ministerial norms always revisable under fresh, canonical, redemptive‑historical exegesis.
  - What is your critique of Ebeling‑type opposition of dogmatics and biblical theology?  
    It undermines the stability of the gospel and misconstrues dogma as an alien imposition rather than the church’s canonical confession.
  - Why not collapse everything into “theological interpretation of Scripture”?  
    Because responsible theology requires both historically sensitive, redemptive‑historical listening and architectonic, doctrinal formulation, which are best clarified by distinguishing biblical and systematic theology as related sciences.
