# Stephen Wellum (1961– )

Stephen Wellum is a contemporary Baptist theologian who has contributed significantly to the discussion of **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**, especially in relation to their distinct roles and necessary integration. He argues that while **Biblical Theology** traces the progressive unfolding of **redemptive history**, **Systematic Theology** synthesizes the canonical data into coherent doctrinal formulations. Wellum insists that both disciplines are essential for a robust understanding of **Scripture** and the development of a faithful **theological method**.

- "Biblical and systematic theology are distinct yet complementary disciplines, both necessary for the church’s understanding and proclamation of God’s Word." (Kingdom through Covenant)

## Key Works

- Kingdom through Covenant: A Biblical-Theological Understanding of the Covenants (with Peter J. Gentry)
- Progressive Covenantalism: Charting a Course Between Dispensational and Covenant Theologies (editor and contributor)
- "Editorial: The Relationship Between Biblical and Systematic Theology" (The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology, 2005)
- Christ Alone: The Uniqueness of Jesus as Savior (The Five Solas Series)
- "From Biblical to Systematic Theology: The Challenge of Integration" (SBJT, 2002)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Biblical Theology Traces Redemptive-Historical Progression**
    - Emphasizes the unfolding of **God’s revelation** through the storyline of Scripture.
    - Focuses on the covenants as the backbone of biblical history.

    - "Biblical theology seeks to trace the unfolding plan of God as it develops through the covenants." (Kingdom through Covenant)

2. **Systematic Theology Synthesizes Canonical Revelation**
    - Organizes biblical data into coherent doctrinal categories.
    - Aims for theological clarity and consistency across the whole canon.
    - Draws on the results of **Biblical Theology** for its formulations.
    - Addresses contemporary questions by applying biblical truth systematically.
    - "Systematic theology asks: What does the whole Bible teach us today about any given topic?" (SBJT, 2005)

3. **Integration of Disciplines is Essential**
    - Argues that **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** must inform each other.
    - Warns against isolating one discipline from the other.
    - Sees integration as vital for faithful exegesis and doctrinal development.
    - Advocates for a methodological approach that respects both the storyline and the doctrinal unity of Scripture.
    - "We must not pit biblical theology against systematic theology; both are necessary for the church." (Kingdom through Covenant)

4. **Christocentric Focus**
    - Maintains that both disciplines must center on the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Sees Christ as the fulfillment of the **covenantal storyline**.
    - Argues that all doctrine must be rooted in the reality of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Insists that Christology is the integrating center of theology.
    - "All theology must be grounded in the person and work of Christ as revealed in Scripture." (Christ Alone)

5. **Scripture as Final Authority**
    - Upholds the **inspiration**, **inerrancy**, and sufficiency of Scripture.
    - Both disciplines must submit to the authority of the biblical text.
    - Rejects any theological method that undermines the primacy of Scripture.
    - Encourages careful exegesis as foundational for all theological construction.

## Legacy and Impact

His advocacy for a **progressive covenantal** approach has influenced contemporary debates on hermeneutics and theological method. Wellum’s work continues to shape how pastors, scholars, and students approach the integration of the Bible’s storyline with doctrinal formulation, emphasizing the necessity of both disciplines for a faithful and robust theology.
