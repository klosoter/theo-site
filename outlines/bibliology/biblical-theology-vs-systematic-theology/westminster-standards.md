# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust vision of **systematic theology** as the disciplined, logical arrangement of the **doctrines of Scripture**, while also affirming the necessity of **biblical theology**—the unfolding of **redemptive history** and the progressive revelation of God’s will. The Standards emphasize that all theology must be grounded in the **infallible Word of God**, with **systematic formulation** serving the church’s faith and practice, and biblical exegesis providing the foundation for doctrinal synthesis.

- "The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture." (Westminster Confession of Faith 1.6)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 1, 7, 8, 14)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (esp. Q&A 1–5, 155–160)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (esp. Q&A 2–3)
- The Directory for Public Worship
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Supreme Authority**
   - All theological reflection, whether biblical or systematic, is subject to the **infallible authority of Scripture**.
   - The Standards insist that **doctrine** must be derived from the **whole counsel of God**.
   - Both the **historical unfolding** (biblical theology) and the **logical arrangement** (systematic theology) are subordinate to Scripture.
   - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture are foundational for both disciplines.
   - "The Supreme Judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be determined... can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture." (WCF 1.10)

2. **Unity and Diversity in Revelation**
   - The Standards recognize the **progressive revelation** of God’s covenant purposes.
   - They distinguish between the **Old and New Covenants** while affirming their unity in Christ.
   - Systematic theology synthesizes this diversity into a coherent doctrinal system.
   - Biblical theology traces the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan through history.
   - "There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations." (WCF 7.6)

3. **Necessity of Doctrinal Formulation**
   - The Standards model the **systematic arrangement** of biblical truth for catechesis and worship.
   - They provide confessional summaries to guard against error and promote unity.
   - Systematic theology is seen as essential for the church’s teaching ministry.
   - Biblical theology supplies the raw material for doctrinal formulation.
   - "The chief end of man is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever." (WSC Q1)

4. **Interpretation by Good and Necessary Consequence**
   - The Standards affirm that doctrine may be drawn not only from explicit texts but also by **good and necessary consequence**.
   - This principle undergirds systematic theology’s task of synthesizing biblical data.
   - It also respects the historical and literary context emphasized by biblical theology.
   - The church is called to discern both the explicit and implicit teaching of Scripture.
   - "All things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith, and life... by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture." (WCF 1.6)

5. **Practical Use of Theology**
   - Both biblical and systematic theology are oriented toward **faith and life**.
   - The Standards stress the application of doctrine to worship, obedience, and assurance.
   - Systematic theology provides clarity and order for Christian living.
   - Biblical theology grounds practice in the unfolding story of redemption.
   - "The Scriptures principally teach what man is to believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of man." (WSC Q3)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped the **Reformed tradition’s** approach to both biblical and systematic theology, insisting on the primacy of Scripture and the necessity of doctrinal clarity. Their balanced emphasis on **redemptive history** and **systematic formulation** has influenced confessional documents, theological education, and preaching throughout the English-speaking world. The Standards remain a touchstone for discussions about the relationship between **biblical theology** and **systematic theology** in the church and academy.
