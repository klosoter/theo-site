# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner distinguished **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** by emphasizing the dynamic, existential encounter with **divine revelation** over abstract doctrinal systems. He critiqued the rationalistic tendencies of traditional **dogmatics**, arguing that theology must arise from the living Word as witnessed in Scripture, rather than from speculative synthesis. Brunner insisted that genuine theology is always oriented toward the **personal address of God** in Christ.

- "Revelation is not doctrine, but event." (Revelation and Reason)

## Key Works

- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Dogmatics, Vol. 1: The Christian Doctrine of God
- Truth as Encounter
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Personal Encounter**
    - Revelation is fundamentally God's self-disclosure in Christ, not merely propositional truth.
    - Theological reflection must begin with the **event** of revelation, not with abstract concepts.
    - **Biblical Theology** is rooted in the narrative and existential encounter with God.
    - Systematic formulations are secondary to the primary act of God addressing humanity.
    - "God does not reveal a system of truth, but Himself." (Revelation and Reason)

2. **Critique of Rationalism in Systematics**
    - Brunner warned against reducing theology to logical or philosophical systems.
    - He saw **Systematic Theology** as prone to distort the living reality of faith.
    - Theological systems can obscure the immediacy of God's Word.
    - True knowledge of God is always relational, not merely intellectual.
    - "The Word of God is not a system of truths, but the truth itself in living form." (Truth as Encounter)

3. **Primacy of Scripture in Theology**
    - Scripture is the unique witness to God's revelation in Christ.
    - **Biblical Theology** must be grounded in the biblical text and its historical context.
    - Systematic reflection must remain subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
    - The Bible is not a sourcebook for doctrines, but the record of God's redemptive acts.
    - "The Bible is not a collection of doctrines, but the witness to the one great act of God." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

4. **Existential and Historical Orientation**
    - Theology must address the existential situation of the believer.
    - Brunner emphasized the historical particularity of revelation.
    - **Biblical Theology** is attentive to the unfolding drama of salvation history.
    - Systematic categories must not override the concrete realities of faith.
    - "Faith is not assent to propositions, but trust in the living God." (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

5. **Necessity and Limits of Systematic Theology**
    - Brunner acknowledged the need for systematic reflection to clarify faith.
    - He insisted that all systematization is provisional and subordinate to revelation.
    - **Systematic Theology** serves the church by articulating faith, but must remain open to correction by Scripture.
    - The danger lies in absolutizing systems rather than serving the living Word.
    - "Systematic theology is necessary, but it must always be theology under the Word." (Revelation and Reason)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s distinction between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** influenced 20th-century Protestant thought, especially in the context of neo-orthodoxy. His emphasis on **revelation as event** and the existential dimension of faith challenged both liberal and scholastic approaches. Brunner’s work continues to provoke discussion about the relationship between Scripture, doctrine, and the living encounter with God, shaping ongoing debates in both academic and ecclesial settings.
