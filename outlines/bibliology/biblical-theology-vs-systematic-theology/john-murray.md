# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray distinguished **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** as distinct yet mutually enriching disciplines within the **Reformed theological tradition**. He argued that **Biblical Theology** traces the progressive unfolding of **redemptive revelation**, while **Systematic Theology** organizes the unified teaching of Scripture into coherent doctrine, both grounded in the authority of **Scripture**.

- "Systematic theology is concerned to show the interrelations of the truths of revelation and to exhibit their organic unity." ("Systematic Theology," Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 4)
- "The Theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith" (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "Principles of Conduct"
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT Commentary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinct but Complementary Disciplines**
    - Maintained that **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** serve different but interrelated purposes.
    - Saw **Biblical Theology** as historical and descriptive, tracing the development of doctrine.
    - Viewed **Systematic Theology** as constructive and logical, synthesizing biblical data into coherent doctrine.
    - Warned against conflating the two, as each has its own method and contribution.
    "Biblical theology and systematic theology are not rivals but allies in the interpretation of God’s Word." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

2. **Primacy of Scripture**
    - Asserted that both disciplines must be grounded in the authority of **Scripture**.
    - Rejected any approach that would subordinate the Bible to philosophical or historical speculation.
    - Emphasized the necessity of exegesis as the foundation for both theological methods.
    - Upheld the **sufficiency of Scripture** for theological formulation.
    "The Bible is the only infallible rule of faith and practice." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

3. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
    - Stressed the **organic unity** of biblical revelation across redemptive history.
    - Argued that both disciplines must account for the progressive nature of revelation.
    - Insisted that **Systematic Theology** must not abstract doctrines from their redemptive-historical context.
    - Affirmed that the unity of Scripture undergirds the unity of theology.
    "The unity of revelation is not static but dynamic, unfolding in the history of redemption." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

4. **Theological Synthesis and Coherence**
    - Held that **Systematic Theology** is responsible for synthesizing biblical data into coherent doctrine.
    - Believed that theological synthesis must respect the diversity and progression found in Scripture.
    - Warned against forced harmonization that ignores biblical distinctions.
    - Saw the task of theology as both analytic and synthetic.
    "Systematic theology seeks to exhibit the organic interrelation of the truths of revelation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

5. **Reformed Confessional Commitment**
    - Operated within the framework of the **Westminster Standards**.
    - Used confessional theology as a guide for systematic reflection, always subject to Scripture.
    - Valued the confessions as faithful summaries of biblical teaching, not as replacements for exegesis.
    - Encouraged continual re-examination of confessional formulations in light of Scripture.
    "The confessions are subordinate standards, always to be tested by the Word of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. His emphasis on the **organic unity of revelation** and the primacy of Scripture continues to influence contemporary discussions of theological method. Murray’s legacy endures in the ongoing integration of historical and systematic approaches within confessional **Reformed theology**.
