# Kevin J. Vanhoozer (1957–)

Kevin J. Vanhoozer is a prominent contemporary theologian who explores the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**, emphasizing their complementary and dialogical roles in the task of **theological interpretation**. He insists that theology must be both **biblically rooted** and **dogmatically coherent**, with **Scripture’s narrative** and doctrinal articulation informing and correcting each other.

- "Systematic theology is not a rival to biblical theology but its dialogical partner in discerning the meaning and significance of the scriptural canon." ("The Drama of Doctrine")

## Key Works

- The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical-Linguistic Approach to Christian Theology
- Biblical Authority after Babel: Retrieving the Solas in the Spirit of Mere Protestant Christianity
- First Theology: God, Scripture & Hermeneutics
- Remythologizing Theology: Divine Action, Passion, and Authorship
- "Exegesis and Hermeneutics" in The Cambridge Companion to Evangelical Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as Theodramatic Participation**
    - Theology interprets Scripture as a **divine drama** in which the church participates.
    - **Biblical Theology** provides the script, while **Systematic Theology** directs the performance.
    - The church is called to improvise faithfully within the canonical script.
    - Doctrine serves as direction for living out the biblical narrative.
    "Doctrine is not a set of theoretical truths but directions for fitting participation in the drama of redemption." (The Drama of Doctrine)

2. **Canonical-Linguistic Approach**
    - Emphasizes the **canon** as the authoritative context for theology.
    - **Systematic Theology** must be accountable to the linguistic and literary form of Scripture.
    - The meaning of doctrine is shaped by canonical usage and context.
    - Theological reflection is always tethered to the biblical text.
    "The canon is the script for the church’s performance." (The Drama of Doctrine)

3. **Dialogical Relationship between Biblical and Systematic Theology**
    - **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** are distinct but mutually enriching.
    - Biblical Theology traces the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - Systematic Theology articulates coherent doctrine for contemporary faith and practice.
    - Both disciplines must engage in ongoing conversation to avoid reductionism.
    "Systematic theology is biblical theology at its best, and biblical theology is systematic theology at its best." (First Theology)

4. **Hermeneutics and Theological Interpretation**
    - Theological interpretation requires attention to **genre**, **authorial intent**, and **canonical context**.
    - Hermeneutics bridges the gap between ancient text and contemporary doctrine.
    - Both disciplines must resist reduction to either history or abstract system.
    - The Spirit guides the church in rightly interpreting and applying Scripture.
    "The meaning of Scripture is ultimately a matter of what God is doing in and through the text." (Remythologizing Theology)

5. **Doctrine as Direction for Ecclesial Practice**
    - Doctrine is not merely propositional but formative for the church’s life.
    - **Systematic Theology** provides guidance for faithful worship, witness, and mission.
    - **Biblical Theology** grounds doctrine in the unfolding story of redemption.
    - The goal is the transformation of the church into Christlikeness.
    "Doctrine exists to equip disciples for their part in the ongoing drama of redemption." (The Drama of Doctrine)

## Legacy and Impact

Vanhoozer has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the relationship between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**, especially within evangelical and Reformed circles. His **canonical-linguistic approach** has encouraged theologians to integrate careful exegesis with doctrinal reflection, resisting the fragmentation of theological disciplines. By framing doctrine as direction for the church’s participation in God’s drama, Vanhoozer has revitalized the role of theology for the life and mission of the church.
