# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge maintained a clear distinction between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology**, regarding the former as the historical and exegetical study of Scripture and the latter as the logical organization of **doctrinal truths**. He insisted that **Systematic Theology** must be grounded in the results of **Biblical Theology**, but also emphasized the necessity of logical coherence and the use of reason in doctrinal formulation.

- "Systematic theology assumes the results of biblical theology, and arranges them in their proper relations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- "The Science of Theology" (Princeton Review, 1857)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Princeton Theologians: A Profile (secondary, Mark Noll)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Systematic Theology as a Science**
    - Theology is a science that arranges and systematizes the facts of Scripture.
    - It seeks to present **doctrines** in their logical relations.
    - Systematic Theology depends on the data provided by **Biblical Theology**.
    - The task is to construct a coherent system from the whole of Scripture.
    - "The office of the theologian is to collect, authenticate, arrange, and exhibit the facts of the Bible." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Primacy of Scripture**
    - Scripture is the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
    - Both Biblical and Systematic Theology must be rooted in the **inspiration** and authority of Scripture.
    - Human reason is subordinate to the revealed Word.
    - All theological systems must be tested by the Bible.
    - "The Bible is to the theologian what nature is to the man of science." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Distinction and Relationship between Disciplines**
    - **Biblical Theology** is historical and descriptive; **Systematic Theology** is logical and synthetic.
    - The former traces the progressive revelation of doctrine; the latter organizes it into a unified whole.
    - Both are necessary for a full understanding of Christian truth.
    - Systematic Theology presupposes the results of Biblical Theology.
    - "Biblical theology is the exhibition of the facts of Scripture in their historical relations; systematic theology, in their logical relations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Role of Reason in Theology**
    - Reason is a minister, not a master, in theology.
    - It is used to arrange, compare, and deduce from the data of revelation.
    - Reason cannot judge the truth of revelation, but can systematize its contents.
    - Theological reasoning must always be subject to the authority of Scripture.
    - "Reason must be subject to the Scriptures, and not the Scriptures to reason." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Unity and Coherence of Doctrine**
    - The truths of Scripture form a coherent, interconnected system.
    - Doctrines must be understood in relation to the whole counsel of God.
    - Apparent contradictions are resolved through careful systematization.
    - The unity of doctrine reflects the unity of divine revelation.
    - "All the truths of the Bible bear a definite relation to each other, and together constitute a system." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s careful distinction between **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** shaped the methodology of generations of Reformed theologians, especially at Princeton Seminary. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the necessity of logical coherence in doctrine remains influential in contemporary evangelical and Reformed theology. Hodge’s approach provided a model for integrating historical exegesis with systematic reflection, ensuring that doctrinal formulation remains both biblically grounded and theologically robust.
