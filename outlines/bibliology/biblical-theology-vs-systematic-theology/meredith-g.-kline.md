# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline distinguished himself by integrating **Biblical Theology** and **Systematic Theology** through his covenantal and redemptive-historical approach. He emphasized the necessity of grounding **systematic formulations** in the **progressive revelation** of Scripture, while also insisting that biblical data must be synthesized into coherent doctrinal systems. Kline’s work demonstrates a commitment to the unity of the **covenant structure** across redemptive history, shaping both biblical and systematic theological reflection.

- "Biblical theology traces the historical unfolding of God’s covenantal revelation, while systematic theology seeks to organize that revelation into a unified doctrinal framework." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos
- Images of the Spirit

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Covenant in Biblical Theology**
    - The covenant is the central organizing principle of redemptive history.
    - Biblical Theology must trace the unfolding of God’s covenants from creation to consummation.
    - Covenantal structures reveal the unity and diversity of Scripture’s message.
    - Systematic Theology must be rooted in the covenantal progression of revelation.
    - "The covenant is the backbone of biblical revelation." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Redemptive-Historical Method**
    - Emphasizes the progressive nature of revelation in history.
    - Biblical Theology interprets texts in their historical and redemptive context.
    - Systematic Theology must respect the historical sequence of revelation.
    - Christ is the center and goal of redemptive history.
    - "Redemptive history is the arena in which God’s self-revelation unfolds." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Integration of Biblical and Systematic Theology**
    - Both disciplines are necessary and mutually enriching.
    - Systematic Theology organizes doctrines; Biblical Theology traces their historical development.
    - Theological synthesis must not ignore the storyline of Scripture.
    - Doctrinal formulations should arise from exegetical and redemptive-historical foundations.
    - "Systematic theology must be biblically grounded, and biblical theology must be theologically informed." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

4. **Authority of Scripture in Theological Method**
    - Scripture is the ultimate authority for both disciplines.
    - The canon’s structure and content guide theological reflection.
    - The authority of the Bible is expressed through its covenantal form.
    - Theological conclusions must be tested against the whole counsel of God.
    - "The structure of biblical authority is covenantal." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

5. **Typology and Symbolism in Biblical Theology**
    - Typology reveals the deeper unity between Old and New Testaments.
    - Symbolic patterns in Scripture point to Christ and eschatological fulfillment.
    - Biblical Theology uncovers the significance of types and shadows.
    - Systematic Theology must account for typological fulfillment in doctrinal synthesis.
    - "Typology is the divinely intended correspondence between the Old Testament and its New Testament fulfillment." (Images of the Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and **redemptive-historical** approach has profoundly shaped Reformed Biblical Theology, especially in its relationship to Systematic Theology. His emphasis on the primacy of the **covenant structure** and the integration of biblical and systematic methods has influenced generations of scholars and pastors. Kline’s work continues to serve as a bridge between careful exegesis and doctrinal synthesis, ensuring that theological systems remain anchored in the unfolding drama of Scripture.
