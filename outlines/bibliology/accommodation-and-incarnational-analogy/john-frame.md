# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **accommodation** and **incarnational analogy** through his distinctive **tri-perspectivalism**, emphasizing that God's revelation is both transcendent and accessible. He maintains that **Scripture** is an act of divine accommodation, where God communicates in human language without compromising His sovereignty or truth, and that the **incarnation** serves as the ultimate model for how God makes Himself known within human limitations.

- "God’s revelation is always an act of accommodation, but it is also always perfectly suited to its purpose." ("The Doctrine of the Word of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2009)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- Perspectives on the Word of God (1990)
- "Scripture Speaks Truly Because God Speaks Truly" (in Revelation and Reason, 2007)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation is Divine Condescension**
    - God adjusts His communication to human capacities without error or loss of truth.
    - Accommodation is rooted in God’s sovereignty and covenantal lordship.
    - Human language is sufficient for true knowledge of God, though not exhaustive.
    - Accommodation is not a concession to human sinfulness, but a gracious act.
    - "God’s accommodation is not a lowering of truth, but a fitting of truth to our needs." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

2. **Incarnational Analogy as Hermeneutical Model**
    - The incarnation of Christ is the paradigm for understanding all divine revelation.
    - Scripture, like Christ, is fully divine and fully human.
    - The analogy safeguards both the authority and accessibility of revelation.
    - This model resists both docetism (denying humanity) and adoptionism (denying divinity) in bibliology.
    - "The incarnational analogy helps us to see that Scripture is both God’s word and a genuinely human word." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

3. **Tri-Perspectival Revelation**
    - Knowledge of God comes through normative (God’s Word), situational (the world), and existential (the self) perspectives.
    - Accommodation operates within all three perspectives.
    - The incarnational analogy is best understood through this multi-perspectival lens.
    - This approach integrates epistemology, ontology, and ethics in revelation.
    - "God’s revelation addresses us as whole persons, in every aspect of our being." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

4. **Scripture’s Inerrancy and Clarity**
    - Accommodation does not entail error or myth in Scripture.
    - The clarity (perspicuity) of Scripture is preserved through accommodation.
    - Human language, though limited, is a reliable vehicle for divine truth.
    - The incarnational analogy upholds both the infallibility and comprehensibility of Scripture.
    - "Scripture is clear and inerrant precisely because God accommodates Himself to us perfectly." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Covenantal Communication**
    - God’s accommodation is covenantal, aiming at relationship and obedience.
    - Revelation is always personal and authoritative, not merely informational.
    - The incarnational analogy highlights God’s commitment to dwell with His people.
    - Accommodation serves the redemptive purpose of the covenant.
    - "God’s speech is always covenantal: it binds us to Him and calls for our response." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s approach to **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of **Scripture’s authority** and hermeneutics. His tri-perspectival method offers a robust framework for understanding how God’s transcendence and immanence are held together in revelation. Frame’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking to articulate a doctrine of Scripture that is both faithful to the Reformed tradition and responsive to modern challenges.
