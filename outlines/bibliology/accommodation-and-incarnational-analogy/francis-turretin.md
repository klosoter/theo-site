# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin developed a robust doctrine of **divine accommodation** within the framework of **Reformed scholasticism**, emphasizing that God reveals Himself to finite creatures by adapting His communication to their capacities. He maintained that **Scripture** and **revelation** employ anthropomorphic language, not because of any deficiency in God, but due to the limitations of human understanding. Turretin’s approach to **incarnational analogy** underscores the distinction between the infinite Creator and finite creatures, while affirming the reliability and clarity of accommodated revelation.

- "God, in order to be known by us, must stoop down to our capacity and accommodate himself to our weakness." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation is a Necessity of Revelation**
    - God’s infinite nature requires Him to **accommodate** His revelation to human finitude.
    - Accommodation does not imply imperfection or error in God’s communication.
    - Anthropomorphic language in Scripture is a tool for divine condescension.
    - The accommodated form preserves the truth and authority of revelation.
    - "God, because of our weakness, uses forms of speech which are accommodated to our capacity." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

2. **Scripture’s Clarity and Reliability Despite Accommodation**
    - Accommodation does not undermine the **perspicuity** of Scripture.
    - The essential doctrines necessary for salvation remain clear and accessible.
    - Human language, though limited, is sufficient for conveying divine truth.
    - The Holy Spirit ensures the efficacy of accommodated revelation.
    - "Although God accommodates himself to our capacity, he does not obscure the necessary truths of salvation." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

3. **Incarnational Analogy: Christ as the Ultimate Accommodation**
    - The **incarnation** is the supreme example of divine accommodation.
    - In Christ, the infinite Word assumes finite human nature without confusion.
    - The analogy between incarnation and revelation illustrates God’s approach to making Himself known.
    - The union of divine and human in Christ models the union of divine truth and human words in Scripture.
    - "As the Word became flesh, so also the divine truth is clothed in human words." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

4. **Distinction Between Essence and Mode of Revelation**
    - God’s **essence** remains unchanged and incomprehensible.
    - The **mode** of revelation is adapted to creaturely limitations.
    - Accommodation pertains to the form, not the substance, of revelation.
    - This distinction safeguards both divine transcendence and immanence.
    - "The mode of revelation is suited to our weakness, but the essence of God remains unaltered." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

5. **Rejection of Socinian and Rationalist Misuse of Accommodation**
    - Turretin opposes the idea that accommodation introduces error or myth into Scripture.
    - He rejects Socinian claims that accommodation undermines biblical authority.
    - Rationalist reduction of accommodation to mere cultural conditioning is denied.
    - True accommodation is a function of divine wisdom, not human invention.
    - "Accommodation is not a license for error, but a testimony to God’s wisdom in revelation." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s doctrine of **accommodation** became foundational for later Reformed theology, shaping discussions of **revelation** and **hermeneutics**. His careful distinction between the substance and mode of revelation influenced both confessional standards and subsequent theologians, including the Princeton tradition. Turretin’s approach continues to inform debates on the nature of biblical language and the relationship between divine transcendence and immanence. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the clarity and sufficiency of accommodated revelation.
