# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets **accommodation** and **incarnational analogy** through the framework of **eschatological hope** and the **kenosis** of God in Christ. For Moltmann, God's revelation is fundamentally **relational** and **historical**, with the incarnation representing God's radical solidarity with humanity and creation.

- "God does not become a religion so that man participates in him by corresponding religious thoughts and feelings, but he becomes man, so that men may participate in his life." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- The Way of Jesus Christ (1989)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Incarnation as Divine Solidarity**
    - The incarnation is God’s ultimate act of **solidarity** with suffering humanity.
    - Christ’s humanity is not a mere appearance but a genuine participation in human existence.
    - Accommodation is seen as God’s willingness to enter into the depths of human pain and history.
    - The cross is the fullest expression of God’s self-identification with the world.
    - "In the cross of Christ, God is revealed as the God who suffers with us and for us." (The Crucified God)

2. **Revelation as Historical Event**
    - God’s self-disclosure occurs within concrete **historical events**, not abstract propositions.
    - Accommodation is realized in God’s engagement with the world’s temporal processes.
    - The resurrection is the promise of new creation, not just a spiritual truth.
    - Revelation is always oriented toward **eschatological fulfillment**.
    - "Revelation takes place in history and opens up history for the future of God." (Theology of Hope)

3. **Kenosis and Divine Self-Limitation**
    - God’s accommodation is expressed through **kenosis**, the self-emptying of divine power.
    - The incarnation is a model of divine humility and openness to the other.
    - God limits himself to make genuine relationship and freedom possible.
    - This self-limitation is not a loss but the mode of God’s loving presence.
    - "God does not become less God by becoming human, but reveals his true divinity in self-giving love." (The Way of Jesus Christ)

4. **Trinitarian Participation**
    - The **Trinity** is the foundation for understanding divine accommodation.
    - The Son’s incarnation is an act of intra-Trinitarian love and sending.
    - The Spirit continues the incarnational presence of God in the world.
    - Accommodation is a dynamic, relational movement within the Godhead and toward creation.
    - "The trinitarian history of God with the world is the history of God's self-communication." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

5. **Eschatological Transformation**
    - Accommodation is oriented toward the **renewal of creation** and the hope of resurrection.
    - The incarnational analogy points to the future where God will be all in all.
    - God’s entry into history is the pledge of its ultimate transformation.
    - The church participates in this movement by embodying hope and reconciliation.
    - "Christian hope sees in the resurrection of Christ not the eternity of the soul, but the beginning of the new creation of all things." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has profoundly shaped modern discussions of **incarnation**, **accommodation**, and the suffering of God. His emphasis on **kenosis** and the relational nature of revelation has influenced both systematic and practical theology, especially in contexts of suffering and liberation. By rooting accommodation in the **Trinitarian** and **eschatological** life of God, Moltmann offers a dynamic vision of divine engagement with the world that continues to inspire contemporary theological reflection.
