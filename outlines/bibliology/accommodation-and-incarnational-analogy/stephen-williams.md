# Stephen Williams (1952– )

Stephen Williams engages the themes of **accommodation** and **incarnational analogy** by emphasizing the self-revelation of God in Scripture and the person of Christ. He explores how divine communication adapts to human limitations without compromising the integrity of **divine truth**, and he critically assesses the use of **incarnational models** in theology, especially regarding **Scripture** and **Christology**.

- "The analogy of incarnation is not a license for uncritical transfer of Christological categories to Scripture, but it does illuminate the humility and condescension of God’s communicative act." ("The Doctrine of Scripture," in The Cambridge Companion to Reformed Theology)

## Key Works

- "The Doctrine of Scripture" in The Cambridge Companion to Reformed Theology (2016)
- Revelation and Reconciliation: A Window on Modernity (1995)
- "Accommodation and Incarnation" in The Trustworthiness of God: Perspectives on the Nature of Scripture (2001)
- The Shadow of the Antichrist: Nietzsche’s Critique of Christianity (2006)
- "Incarnation and the Doctrine of Scripture" (various essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation as Divine Condescension**
   - God’s self-revelation is marked by a gracious adaptation to human finitude.
   - **Accommodation** does not entail error or falsehood but reflects God’s communicative intent.
   - The concept is rooted in the biblical narrative, especially in the **incarnation**.
   - Williams resists reducing accommodation to mere cultural relativism.
   - "Accommodation is not a concession to error but an expression of divine grace." (Revelation and Reconciliation)

2. **Incarnational Analogy for Scripture**
   - The analogy between **Christ’s incarnation** and **Scripture** is helpful but limited.
   - Scripture, like Christ, is both fully divine and genuinely human in its form.
   - The analogy must not blur the ontological distinction between Christ and the Bible.
   - Williams warns against overextending the analogy to justify problematic views of Scripture.
   - "The incarnational analogy is illuminating, but it must be handled with theological care." ("Accommodation and Incarnation")

3. **Revelation as Personal and Propositional**
   - Divine revelation involves both personal encounter and propositional content.
   - Accommodation serves the purpose of making propositional truth accessible.
   - The **Word made flesh** is the paradigm for understanding God’s communicative acts.
   - Williams affirms the unity of revelation in Christ and in Scripture.
   - "Revelation is not less than propositional, but always more: it is personal." (Revelation and Reconciliation)

4. **Critical Engagement with Modern Hermeneutics**
   - Williams interacts with modern and postmodern critiques of **inerrancy** and **inspiration**.
   - He upholds the trustworthiness of Scripture while acknowledging human elements.
   - Accommodation is not an excuse for dismissing difficult texts.
   - He advocates a nuanced, historically informed hermeneutic.
   - "To affirm accommodation is not to abandon the authority of Scripture." ("The Doctrine of Scripture")

5. **Christological Center of Accommodation**
   - The **incarnation** is the ultimate act of accommodation.
   - All divine accommodation finds its center and meaning in Christ.
   - The humility of God in Christ shapes the church’s approach to Scripture and doctrine.
   - Williams insists that the analogy must be governed by robust **Christology**.
   - "The humility of God in Christ is the key to understanding all divine accommodation." ("Incarnation and the Doctrine of Scripture")

## Legacy and Impact

Stephen Williams has contributed significantly to contemporary discussions of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** within Reformed theology. His careful distinctions and Christological focus have influenced debates on the nature of **Scripture** and divine revelation. Williams’s work encourages theologians to approach the analogy between Christ and Scripture with both theological rigor and humility, shaping ongoing conversations about the authority and humanity of the Bible.
