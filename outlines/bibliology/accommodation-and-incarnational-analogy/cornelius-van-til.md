# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til developed a robust doctrine of **accommodation** grounded in his **Reformed epistemology** and the **Creator-creature distinction**. He emphasized that all divine revelation, including the **incarnation**, is necessarily analogical, insisting that God’s self-disclosure is always accommodated to human finitude without compromising divine truth.

- "All revelation of necessity must be anthropomorphic." ("The Defense of the Faith")

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- The Doctrine of Scripture
- Christian Apologetics
- A Christian Theory of Knowledge

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creator-Creature Distinction as Foundation**
    - God is ontologically distinct from creation, making all knowledge of God analogical.
    - Human understanding is always dependent on God’s self-revelation.
    - Accommodation is necessary because of the infinite qualitative difference between God and man.
    - The incarnation exemplifies God’s condescension without compromising his transcendence.
    - "God’s thoughts are not our thoughts, and our thoughts must be patterned after his by analogy." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Revelation is Accommodated and Analogical**
    - Divine revelation is always suited to human capacity.
    - Anthropomorphic language is not a limitation but a necessity for true knowledge of God.
    - Accommodation does not entail error or falsehood in revelation.
    - The analogical nature of revelation preserves both divine mystery and genuine knowledge.
    - "All revelation is necessarily anthropomorphic because it is God speaking to man." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Incarnation as the Supreme Accommodation**
    - The incarnation is the ultimate act of divine accommodation.
    - In Christ, God communicates himself in a fully human mode without ceasing to be God.
    - The incarnational analogy illustrates how God’s revelation is both veiled and unveiled.
    - The incarnation safeguards the unity of divine and human in revelation.
    - "The incarnation is the climax of God’s accommodation to man." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Scripture as Accommodated Revelation**
    - The Bible is the inspired, infallible record of God’s accommodated self-disclosure.
    - Scriptural language is necessarily anthropomorphic and analogical.
    - The doctrine of inspiration upholds both divine authority and human instrumentality.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are maintained within the framework of accommodation.
    - "Scripture is God’s own interpretation of his acts, given in accommodated form." (The Doctrine of Scripture)

5. **Epistemological Implications of Accommodation**
    - Human knowledge of God is never exhaustive but always true as analogical.
    - The principle of accommodation undergirds Van Til’s critique of autonomous reason.
    - All theology must begin with the presupposition of accommodated revelation.
    - The incarnational analogy shapes a distinctly Reformed approach to apologetics and theology.
    - "We must think God’s thoughts after him, always in terms of the accommodation he has made to us." (A Christian Theory of Knowledge)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology and presuppositional apologetics. His insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction** and analogical knowledge continues to influence debates on revelation, hermeneutics, and the doctrine of Scripture. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of a consistently Reformed approach to theology and apologetics, especially at Westminster Theological Seminary and among his many students.
