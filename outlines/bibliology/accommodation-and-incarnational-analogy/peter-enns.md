# Peter Enns (1961– )

Peter Enns is known for his advocacy of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** in understanding **Scripture**. He argues that just as **Christ’s incarnation** involved genuine participation in human limitations, so too does the Bible reflect the historical and cultural contexts of its human authors, while still conveying **divine revelation**.

- "The Bible, at every turn, shows how willing God is to meet us where we are, to speak our language, to accommodate." ("Inspiration and Incarnation")

## Key Works

- Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament (2005)
- The Evolution of Adam: What the Bible Does and Doesn’t Say about Human Origins (2012)
- The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It (2014)
- How the Bible Actually Works (2019)
- "Accommodation and Incarnation: The Divine and Human in Scripture" (various essays/interviews)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Incarnational**
    - Scripture is both fully **divine** and fully **human**, analogous to the two natures of Christ.
    - The Bible’s human features—historical context, literary forms, and cultural assumptions—are not obstacles but essential to its nature.
    - Divine revelation comes through genuine human participation, not by bypassing human limitations.
    - The **incarnational analogy** helps explain apparent difficulties or diversity within the biblical text.
    - "The doctrine of inspiration must account for both the divine and human aspects of Scripture." (Inspiration and Incarnation)

2. **Accommodation as Divine Condescension**
    - God communicates in ways that are understandable to finite, culturally situated people.
    - Accommodation is not a flaw but a necessary aspect of revelation.
    - The presence of ancient Near Eastern parallels and worldviews in Scripture is evidence of accommodation.
    - This approach challenges strict notions of **inerrancy** that ignore the Bible’s human context.
    - "God lets his children tell the story, so to speak, and that means the story comes out in their language and concepts." (Inspiration and Incarnation)

3. **Historical and Cultural Contextualization**
    - The Bible must be read with sensitivity to its ancient contexts.
    - Biblical authors used the intellectual categories and assumptions of their time.
    - Understanding **genre** and **historical setting** is crucial for interpretation.
    - The diversity within Scripture reflects the diversity of its human authors and settings.
    - "The Bible is not an abstract, otherworldly book; it is a thoroughly contextual, historical product." (Inspiration and Incarnation)

4. **Challenging Traditional Evangelical Bibliology**
    - Enns critiques a rigid, propositional view of **inspiration** that neglects the Bible’s humanity.
    - He calls for a re-examination of **inerrancy** in light of the incarnational model.
    - Evangelical approaches must grapple honestly with the Bible’s complexity and diversity.
    - Faithfulness to Scripture requires acknowledging both its divine message and human form.
    - "We need to stop protecting the Bible from itself and let it be what it is." (The Bible Tells Me So)

5. **Scripture’s Authority through Divine-Human Synergy**
    - The authority of Scripture is not diminished by its human features.
    - Divine truth is communicated through, not in spite of, human limitations.
    - The incarnational analogy affirms that God’s purposes are accomplished through ordinary means.
    - The Bible’s authority is dynamic, rooted in its capacity to speak across cultures and times.
    - "The Bible’s authority is grounded in its ability to speak God’s word through the words of real people in real times and places." (How the Bible Actually Works)

## Legacy and Impact

Peter Enns has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** within evangelical and Reformed circles. His work has prompted renewed attention to the **humanity of Scripture** and challenged traditional models of **inspiration** and **inerrancy**. While controversial among some conservatives, Enns’s approach has encouraged many to engage the Bible with greater historical and theological nuance, fostering more robust dialogue about the nature of **divine revelation**.
