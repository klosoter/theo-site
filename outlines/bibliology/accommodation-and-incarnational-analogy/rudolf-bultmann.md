# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **accommodation** and **incarnational analogy** through his program of **demythologization**, seeking to reinterpret the **New Testament kerygma** in existential terms. He argued that the biblical witness reflects the **worldview** and **language** of its time, and that the divine message is accommodated to human understanding through mythic forms, which must be translated for modern existential relevance.

- "The cosmology of the New Testament is essentially mythical in character." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Kerygma and Myth (1948, with contributions by Bultmann)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization as Accommodation**
    - The biblical message is expressed in mythological terms suited to its original audience.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential truth behind these forms.
    - Accommodation is not about factual accuracy but about meaningful communication.
    - The interpreter must translate ancient myths into concepts accessible to modern people.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Revelation**
    - Revelation is not propositional but confronts the individual in existential decision.
    - The incarnational analogy is reinterpreted as the encounter with the kerygma.
    - Faith arises from the existential impact of the proclaimed word, not from historical facts.
    - The divine accommodates itself by addressing human existence in its concrete situation.
    - "What matters is not the objective historicity of the event but its existential meaning." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Historical Relativity of Scriptural Forms**
    - Scriptural language is conditioned by its historical and cultural context.
    - The incarnation is not a metaphysical event but a mythic expression of divine encounter.
    - Accommodation involves recognizing the temporality of biblical forms.
    - The task is to distinguish the message from its culturally bound expressions.
    - "We cannot use electric light and radio, and in the event of illness avail ourselves of modern medical and clinical means, and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

4. **Christ as the Event of Encounter**
    - The incarnational analogy is existentialized: Christ is the event of God's address.
    - The meaning of incarnation is found in the proclamation that confronts the hearer.
    - The accommodation of God is realized in the existential call to faith.
    - The historical Jesus is less important than the Christ who is proclaimed.
    - "Christ is present in the word as the event of encounter." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Rejection of Objective Supernaturalism**
    - Bultmann denies the possibility of supernatural intervention in history.
    - Accommodation does not imply factual divine acts but symbolic communication.
    - The incarnational analogy is a mythic way of expressing existential truth.
    - Faith is not assent to supernatural events but openness to existential transformation.
    - "It is impossible to use electric light and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** profoundly shaped twentieth-century **biblical hermeneutics** and the existential interpretation of Scripture. His insistence on demythologization challenged traditional views of revelation and incarnation, prompting both sharp criticism and creative engagement. While many in the Reformed tradition rejected his existentialist reduction, his work remains influential in discussions of how divine truth is mediated through culturally conditioned forms. Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between historical context, theological meaning, and the proclamation of the gospel.
