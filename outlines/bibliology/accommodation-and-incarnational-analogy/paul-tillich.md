# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** through his method of **correlation**, emphasizing the dynamic relationship between **divine revelation** and human cultural forms. For Tillich, the **incarnation** is not merely a historical event but a symbol of the ongoing intersection of the **divine** and the **human**, where God "accommodates" revelation to human existential questions.

- "The divine self-manifestation is always an event in which the eternal enters the temporal, the infinite the finite, the transcendent the immanent." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (Vols. 1–3)
- The Courage to Be
- Theology of Culture
- Dynamics of Faith
- The Protestant Era

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Method of Correlation**
    - Theology must relate **eternal truth** to the **existential questions** of each age.
    - Divine revelation is always interpreted within the context of human culture and experience.
    - Theological symbols are meaningful only as they address the concerns of contemporary existence.
    - Accommodation is not a concession but a necessary aspect of meaningful revelation.
    - "The method of correlation explains the contents of the Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Symbolic Nature of Revelation**
    - All language about God is **symbolic**, not literal.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point, making accommodation possible.
    - The **incarnation** is the central symbol of the unity of divine and human.
    - Accommodation is inherent in the use of symbols to communicate the transcendent.
    - "Symbols open up levels of reality which otherwise are hidden and cannot be grasped in any other way." (Dynamics of Faith)

3. **Incarnation as Existential Event**
    - The incarnation is not only a past event but an ongoing reality in history.
    - It represents the **New Being** breaking into human estrangement.
    - The incarnational analogy illustrates how the divine becomes present in the finite.
    - Accommodation is seen in the continual presence of the divine within human existence.
    - "The New Being appears under the conditions of existence, conquering them and transforming them." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Divine-Human Polarity**
    - God’s self-disclosure always involves a dialectic between **transcendence** and **immanence**.
    - Accommodation is the process by which the transcendent becomes immanent without losing transcendence.
    - The incarnational analogy expresses this polarity in the person of Christ.
    - Human reception of revelation is conditioned by historical and existential context.
    - "God is always beyond the content of revelation, but he is also always in it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Critique of Literalism**
    - Literal interpretations of revelation fail to grasp the depth of divine accommodation.
    - The incarnational analogy warns against reducing revelation to mere historical facts.
    - Faith requires openness to the symbolic and existential dimensions of revelation.
    - Accommodation is distorted when symbols are absolutized or historicized.
    - "Literalism deprives God of his divinity and makes him a being beside others." (Dynamics of Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** has profoundly shaped modern **systematic theology**, especially in its engagement with culture and existential philosophy. His emphasis on **symbolism** and the method of correlation provided a framework for relating Christian doctrine to contemporary questions. While some critics charge that Tillich’s views risk undermining the particularity of revelation, his work remains influential in discussions of how the **divine** is communicated within human history and language.
