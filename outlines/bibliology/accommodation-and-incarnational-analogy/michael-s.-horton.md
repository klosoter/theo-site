# Michael S. Horton (1964– )

Michael S. Horton advances a robust doctrine of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** within **Reformed theology**. He contends that God's self-revelation, especially in **Scripture** and the **person of Christ**, involves gracious divine condescension to human limitations, yet without compromising truth or holiness. Horton’s hallmark is to relate the unity of the divine and human in revelation to the mystery of the **hypostatic union**.

- "God accommodates himself to our capacity, not by falsifying his revelation but by condescending to our creaturely limitations." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Works

- Covenant and Eschatology: The Divine Drama
- People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology
- Lord and Servant: A Covenant Christology
- Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation as Divine Condescension**
    - God reveals himself in ways suited to human understanding, without distortion of truth.
    - Accommodation is rooted in God's **covenantal** approach to humanity.
    - The language and forms of **Scripture** reflect this divine adaptation.
    - Horton rejects any notion that accommodation entails error or myth.
    "Accommodation is not a lowering of truth but a gracious adaptation to our finitude." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Incarnational Analogy in Revelation**
    - The **incarnation** serves as the supreme model for understanding all divine revelation.
    - Just as Christ is fully God and fully man, **Scripture** is both divine and human in origin.
    - The analogy safeguards both the transcendence and immanence of God in revelation.
    - Horton uses this analogy to defend the reliability and authority of **Scripture**.
    "The incarnational analogy helps us affirm both the divine authorship and human character of Scripture." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Rejection of Modernist Reductionism**
    - Horton critiques attempts to explain accommodation as mere cultural relativism.
    - He insists on the objective reality of God's self-disclosure.
    - Accommodation does not entail capitulation to human subjectivity.
    - The integrity of **revelation** is preserved despite its contextual form.
    "Accommodation is not a surrender to culture but a sovereign act of revelation." (Covenant and Eschatology)

4. **Covenantal Context of Accommodation**
    - Accommodation is always situated within God's **covenantal** dealings with his people.
    - The pattern of promise and fulfillment shapes the manner of revelation.
    - God's speech-acts in history are both accommodated and authoritative.
    - The covenant provides the framework for understanding the unity of **Scripture**.
    "God's accommodation is covenantal, always oriented to his redemptive purposes." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Christocentric Focus of Revelation**
    - The person and work of **Christ** are the climax of God's accommodated revelation.
    - All **Scripture** points to and is fulfilled in Christ.
    - The incarnational analogy finds its fullest expression in the gospel.
    - Horton maintains that Christ is both the content and the means of **revelation**.
    "The incarnation is the definitive act of divine accommodation." (Lord and Servant)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael S. Horton has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by clarifying the doctrines of accommodation and the incarnational analogy, especially in relation to **Scripture** and **Christology**. His work has provided a nuanced alternative to both liberal and fundamentalist approaches to **revelation**, emphasizing the unity of divine and human elements. Horton’s covenantal and Christocentric emphases continue to influence theological education and ecclesial practice, reinforcing the authority and reliability of God’s self-disclosure.
