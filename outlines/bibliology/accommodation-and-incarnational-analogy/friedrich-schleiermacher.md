# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** by grounding revelation in the immediacy of **religious experience** and the consciousness of Christ. He rejected traditional notions of propositional revelation, instead emphasizing that **God’s self-disclosure** is mediated through the historical person of Jesus and the evolving consciousness of the church. For Schleiermacher, accommodation is not a divine condescension to human ignorance, but the natural mode by which the infinite becomes accessible within finite human experience.

- "The Redeemer is, for us, the revelation of God, not because He has made new disclosures, but because He has communicated a new life." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Religious Consciousness**
    - Revelation is not external information but the self-consciousness of absolute dependence on God.
    - Christ embodies the highest realization of God-consciousness.
    - Accommodation is the process by which divine reality is apprehended in human experience.
    - The church is the ongoing locus of this mediated revelation.
    - "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Incarnation as Paradigm of Accommodation**
    - The incarnation is the supreme instance of divine accommodation to human conditions.
    - Jesus’ God-consciousness is the model for understanding divine-human interaction.
    - The historical Jesus is the medium through which God’s presence is made accessible.
    - Incarnational analogy means all revelation is mediated, not immediate.
    - "In Him the divine essence is united with human nature in a unique way." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Critique of Propositional Revelation**
    - Rejects the idea that revelation consists of divinely dictated propositions.
    - Emphasizes the dynamic, experiential nature of revelation.
    - Accommodation is not about simplifying doctrines, but about existential appropriation.
    - Scripture is a witness to revelation, not revelation itself.
    - "Scripture is only the record of the original utterances of the Christian self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Historical Mediation of Divine Truth**
    - Divine truth is always mediated through historical and cultural forms.
    - Accommodation involves God working within the limitations of human language and context.
    - The development of doctrine reflects the ongoing process of accommodation.
    - The incarnational analogy extends to the church’s life and teaching.
    - "Every dogmatic statement is conditioned by its historical situation." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Primacy of Christ’s God-Consciousness**
    - Christ’s unique God-consciousness is the center of Christian faith and revelation.
    - The incarnational analogy is grounded in the singularity of Christ’s religious experience.
    - Accommodation is possible because Christ bridges the infinite and finite.
    - The church participates in this God-consciousness through the Spirit.
    - "The Redeemer’s God-consciousness is the central source of all Christian piety." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** profoundly shaped modern theology, shifting the focus from external authority to the internal dynamics of religious experience. His emphasis on the **historical mediation** of revelation influenced later liberal and neo-orthodox theologians. While often critiqued for subjectivism, his insights remain foundational for discussions of revelation, incarnation, and the relationship between divine transcendence and human finitude.
