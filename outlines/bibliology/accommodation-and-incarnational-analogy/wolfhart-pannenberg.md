# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** through his commitment to the historical self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ. He emphasized that divine revelation is not a static deposit but unfolds dynamically within **history**, culminating in the **incarnation** as the supreme act of God's self-accommodation to human understanding. For Pannenberg, the analogy between the incarnation and all divine revelation underscores the unity of God's action and the intelligibility of faith within the context of human history.

- "The revelation of God is not a communication of truths, but the self-disclosure of God in history, reaching its climax in Jesus Christ." (Revelation as History)

## Key Works

- Revelation as History (1968)
- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1–3 (1988–1993)
- Theology and the Philosophy of Science (1976)
- Basic Questions in Theology (1970–1973)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Historical Event**
   - Divine revelation occurs through concrete events in history, not abstract propositions.
   - The **incarnation** is the definitive historical act of God's self-disclosure.
   - Accommodation is realized as God enters and acts within the human historical process.
   - Human understanding of God is always mediated through historical realities.
   - "God’s revelation is not a deposit of truths but an event in history." (Revelation as History)

2. **Incarnation as Paradigm of Accommodation**
   - The **incarnation** is the supreme model for understanding all divine accommodation.
   - In Christ, God fully identifies with human existence without ceasing to be divine.
   - The incarnational analogy shapes how Scripture and revelation are understood as both divine and human.
   - Accommodation is not a concession but the very mode of God’s self-giving.
   - "The incarnation is the central event in which God’s accommodation to humanity is fully realized." (Jesus—God and Man)

3. **Unity of Divine Action and Human History**
   - God’s actions are not external interventions but are woven into the fabric of history.
   - The unity of divine and human in Christ is mirrored in the unity of revelation and history.
   - Accommodation means God’s purposes are intelligible within historical processes.
   - The **resurrection** is the eschatological confirmation of God’s self-accommodation.
   - "History is the medium of God’s self-revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Epistemological Openness of Revelation**
   - Revelation is accessible and open to rational inquiry because it is historical.
   - The incarnational analogy ensures that faith is not irrational but grounded in public events.
   - Accommodation involves God making himself knowable within the limits of human reason.
   - Theological claims must be open to verification within the horizon of history.
   - "Faith must be open to the scrutiny of reason because revelation is historical." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

5. **Trinitarian Foundation of Accommodation**
   - The self-accommodation of God is rooted in the **Trinitarian** life of God.
   - The Father sends the Son in the power of the Spirit, enacting accommodation in salvation history.
   - The incarnational analogy is ultimately grounded in the eternal relations within the Trinity.
   - Divine accommodation is not a temporary strategy but reflects God’s eternal being-for-others.
   - "The sending of the Son is the Trinitarian ground of God’s accommodation to the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** has profoundly shaped modern discussions of revelation, especially within the context of **historical theology** and **Christology**. His insistence on the unity of revelation and history challenged both existentialist and neo-orthodox tendencies to separate faith from historical reality. Pannenberg’s work continues to influence debates on the intelligibility of faith, the nature of divine self-disclosure, and the relationship between theology and the sciences. His legacy endures in the ongoing quest to articulate a robust, historically grounded doctrine of revelation.
