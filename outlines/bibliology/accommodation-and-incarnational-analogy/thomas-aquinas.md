# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a robust doctrine of **divine accommodation**, arguing that God reveals Himself in ways suited to human understanding. He employed the **incarnational analogy** to explain how the **infinite God** communicates through finite means, especially in **Scripture** and the **Incarnation** of Christ. Aquinas maintained that while God's essence remains transcendent, His self-disclosure is always adapted to the limitations of human reason.

- "It is befitting Holy Writ to put forward divine and spiritual truths by means of comparisons with material things." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.1, a.9)

- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- De Veritate
- Commentary on the Gospel of John
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Accommodation is Necessary**
    - God’s infinite nature surpasses human comprehension.
    - Revelation is always mediated through **created forms** and analogies.
    - Accommodation preserves both divine transcendence and accessibility.
    - Human language about God is necessarily **analogical**, not univocal.
    - "Because human knowledge begins from sense, divine truths are presented to us in Scripture under the likeness of corporeal things." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.1, a.9)

2. **Analogy of Being (Analogia Entis)**
    - Human language about God is neither purely literal nor purely metaphorical.
    - The **analogy of being** allows for true, though limited, knowledge of God.
    - All predicates about God are said analogically, reflecting both similarity and greater dissimilarity.
    - This analogy undergirds both **accommodation** and **incarnational theology**.
    - "Between Creator and creature no similitude can be expressed without implying a greater dissimilitude." (Fourth Lateran Council, cited in Summa Contra Gentiles I.30)

3. **Incarnation as the Supreme Accommodation**
    - The **Incarnation** is the fullest expression of divine accommodation.
    - In Christ, the divine nature is united to human nature without confusion.
    - The Incarnation reveals God in a manner perfectly suited to human apprehension.
    - This event grounds the possibility of all other forms of accommodation.
    - "It was necessary for man's salvation that God should become incarnate, so that thus man might be taught by a visible way." (Summa Theologiae III, Q.1, a.2)

4. **Scripture as Accommodated Revelation**
    - **Scripture** employs human language, images, and genres to communicate divine truth.
    - The literal and spiritual senses of Scripture reflect the principle of accommodation.
    - Biblical anthropomorphisms are not literal but accommodated to human understanding.
    - The authority of Scripture is grounded in its divine origin, despite accommodated form.
    - "Holy Scripture fittingly puts forward divine and spiritual truths by means of comparisons with material things." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.1, a.9)

5. **Limits and Safeguards of Accommodation**
    - Accommodation must not compromise the **immutability** or **simplicity** of God.
    - The analogical nature of language safeguards against both anthropomorphism and agnosticism.
    - The Church’s doctrinal tradition interprets accommodated revelation faithfully.
    - Human reason, though limited, is a real (but subordinate) means of apprehending accommodated truth.
    - "We cannot know what God is, but only what He is not; we must therefore consider the ways in which God does not resemble creatures rather than the ways in which He does." (Summa Contra Gentiles I.30)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **accommodation** and his use of the **incarnational analogy** have profoundly shaped both Catholic and Protestant approaches to **revelation** and **theology proper**. His careful articulation of the **analogy of being** remains foundational for discussions of how finite creatures can speak truly of the infinite God. Later theologians, including those in the Reformed tradition, have engaged critically with Aquinas’s framework, often adopting his insights on analogy while modifying his metaphysical assumptions. His influence endures in debates over biblical language, Christology, and the nature of theological language.
