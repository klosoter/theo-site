# Kevin J. Vanhoozer (1957– )

Kevin J. Vanhoozer approaches **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** as central to understanding how **God communicates** in Scripture. He emphasizes that divine revelation is both **theologically authoritative** and genuinely **human**, drawing on the analogy of the **incarnation** to explain how **Scripture** can be fully God's word in human words without diminishing either aspect.

- "The incarnation is the paradigm for understanding all divine self-communication." (The Drama of Doctrine)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation as Divine Condescension**
    - God adapts his communication to human limitations without compromising truth.
    - Accommodation is not deception but a gracious act of revelation.
    - The form and content of Scripture reflect God's willingness to meet humanity where they are.
    - This preserves both **divine transcendence** and **immanence** in revelation.
    - "God accommodates himself to human capacities in order to make himself known." (First Theology)

2. **Incarnational Analogy for Scripture**
    - The incarnation of Christ serves as the model for understanding Scripture's dual nature.
    - Scripture is both fully divine and fully human, analogous to Christ's two natures.
    - This analogy safeguards against both docetism (denying humanity) and adoptionism (denying divinity) in bibliology.
    - The analogy highlights the unity and distinction between divine authorship and human agency.
    - "The Word made flesh is the pattern for the word written." (The Drama of Doctrine)

3. **Canonical-Linguistic Approach**
    - Meaning arises from the canonical form of Scripture, shaped by both divine and human authorship.
    - The church's interpretive practices are guided by the canon as a unified drama.
    - The **canonical-linguistic** model resists reduction to either historical criticism or subjective interpretation.
    - Doctrine emerges from the interplay of text, tradition, and community.
    - "The church is called to perform the script of Scripture." (The Drama of Doctrine)

4. **Speech-Act Theory and Divine Communication**
    - God acts through Scripture by means of **locutions**, **illocutions**, and **perlocutions**.
    - Divine speech acts are accommodated to human language and context.
    - This model clarifies how Scripture can be both authoritative and contextually situated.
    - The performative nature of Scripture invites participation in God's communicative action.
    - "God's word does things in the world." (Is There a Meaning in This Text?)

5. **Hermeneutical Humility and Theological Realism**
    - Interpreters must recognize their own limitations and the complexity of divine communication.
    - The incarnational analogy encourages humility before the mystery of revelation.
    - Theological realism affirms that God truly speaks, even through human words.
    - The church's interpretive task is ongoing, communal, and Spirit-led.
    - "We must approach the text with both confidence in God's self-revelation and humility about our understanding." (Remythologizing Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vanhoozer has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **Scripture's authority** and the nature of **divine revelation**. His use of the **incarnational analogy** has provided a robust framework for affirming both the divinity and humanity of the biblical text. By integrating **speech-act theory** and a canonical approach, he has offered tools for faithful interpretation that resist both reductionism and skepticism. His work continues to influence evangelical theology, hermeneutics, and the doctrine of Scripture.
