# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper advanced a robust doctrine of **divine accommodation**, emphasizing that God reveals Himself in ways suited to human limitations, especially through **Scripture** and the **incarnation of Christ**. Kuyper’s use of the **incarnational analogy** underscores the unity of divine and human elements in revelation, paralleling the two natures of Christ with the dual authorship of Scripture. This approach allowed Kuyper to affirm both the **authority** and **humanity** of the Bible without compromising its **infallibility**.

- "The Holy Scripture is not an abstract, heavenly book, but a divine work that has entered into the realities of our human existence." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation as Divine Condescension**
    - God reveals Himself by adapting His communication to human capacity.
    - Accommodation is not deception but a gracious act rooted in God’s sovereignty.
    - Scripture’s human features are intentional, not accidental.
    - The divine message remains uncorrupted despite human limitations.
    - "Accommodation is not a lowering of truth, but a fitting of truth to our condition." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

2. **Incarnational Analogy in Revelation**
    - The union of divine and human in Christ serves as a model for understanding Scripture.
    - Both the Bible and Christ are fully divine and fully human.
    - The analogy safeguards the integrity of both natures in revelation.
    - This model resists both rationalism and mysticism.
    - "As Christ is both God and man, so Scripture is both divine and human." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

3. **Organic Inspiration of Scripture**
    - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but an organic process.
    - Human authors’ personalities and contexts are preserved in the text.
    - The Holy Spirit superintends the entire process of revelation.
    - Organic inspiration ensures both infallibility and genuine humanity.
    - "The Holy Spirit did not suppress the individuality of the writers, but sanctified it." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

4. **Authority and Infallibility of Scripture**
    - The Bible’s authority is grounded in its divine origin.
    - Infallibility is compatible with the human form of Scripture.
    - Apparent imperfections reflect accommodation, not error.
    - The church’s recognition of Scripture’s authority is itself a work of the Spirit.
    - "The authority of Scripture rests in its being the Word of God, accommodated to us." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

5. **Antithesis and Common Grace**
    - The antithesis distinguishes between regenerate and unregenerate responses to revelation.
    - Common grace allows for genuine knowledge of God even among unbelievers.
    - Accommodation is an expression of God’s common grace to humanity.
    - The incarnational analogy supports engagement with culture while maintaining theological boundaries.
    - "Common grace opens the way for revelation to be understood, even by those outside the faith." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s articulation of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** has profoundly influenced Reformed approaches to **Scripture** and **revelation**. His organic model of inspiration shaped later neo-Calvinist and evangelical thought, providing a framework for affirming both the divine authority and human character of the Bible. Kuyper’s insights continue to inform debates on biblical hermeneutics, the relationship between faith and culture, and the nature of theological engagement with modernity.
