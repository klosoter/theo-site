# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of **accommodation** is central to his understanding of how God reveals Himself to humanity, especially in Scripture. He frequently employs the **incarnational analogy**, asserting that just as Christ took on human flesh, so too God’s self-disclosure is adapted to our finite capacities. This approach safeguards both the **transcendence** and **immanence** of God, ensuring that divine truth is genuinely communicated without compromising God’s majesty.

- "For who even of slight intelligence does not understand that, as nurses commonly do with infants, God is wont in a measure to ‘lisp’ in speaking to us?" (Institutes 1.13.1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation as Divine Condescension**
    - God adjusts His revelation to human limitations.
    - Accommodation preserves the **incomprehensibility** of God while making knowledge possible.
    - Scriptural language is often figurative or anthropomorphic due to this principle.
    - Calvin uses the analogy of a nurse lisping to a child to illustrate accommodation.
    - "For who is so devoid of intellect as not to understand that God, in so speaking, lisps with us as nurses are wont to do with little children?" (Institutes 1.13.1)

2. **Incarnational Analogy in Revelation**
    - The incarnation of Christ is the supreme example of divine accommodation.
    - Scripture’s humanity parallels Christ’s humanity: both are fully divine yet truly accessible.
    - The analogy underscores the unity of **Word and Spirit** in revelation.
    - Calvin insists that God’s self-revelation never ceases to be true, even when adapted.
    - "For just as God, in order to reveal himself to us, must descend far beneath his loftiness, so also the Scripture, in order to instruct us, speaks in a manner suited to our capacity." (Commentary on Genesis 1:16)

3. **Scripture as Accommodated Revelation**
    - The Bible is the primary locus of God’s accommodated speech.
    - Anthropomorphic expressions are not literal but serve to communicate truth.
    - The clarity and authority of Scripture are maintained despite accommodation.
    - Calvin affirms the **perspicuity** of Scripture within the bounds of accommodation.
    - "God, in so speaking, does not so much express what he is in himself, as what he is towards us." (Institutes 1.17.13)

4. **Safeguarding Divine Transcendence and Immanence**
    - Accommodation maintains God’s transcendence while ensuring genuine immanence.
    - God’s condescension does not diminish His glory or essence.
    - The incarnational analogy prevents confusion between Creator and creature.
    - Calvin rejects any notion that accommodation implies divine limitation or error.
    - "He so tempers his majesty, that it may not overwhelm us, but rather gently attract us." (Commentary on Psalm 113:6)

5. **Hermeneutical Implications**
    - Interpreters must recognize accommodation to avoid misreading Scripture.
    - The principle guides Calvin’s exegesis, especially regarding difficult or anthropomorphic texts.
    - Accommodation encourages humility and reverence before God’s Word.
    - Calvin’s hermeneutic resists rationalism and anthropocentrism.
    - "Let us remember that the Spirit, accommodating himself to our ignorance, reveals to us only what is useful to be known." (Commentary on Genesis 1:6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of **accommodation** has profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to **Scripture**, revelation, and Christology. His use of the **incarnational analogy** provided a robust theological framework for understanding how the infinite God communicates with finite humanity. Later Reformed theologians, including those at Westminster, have drawn extensively on Calvin’s insights to articulate doctrines of revelation that honor both divine majesty and accessibility. His legacy endures in contemporary discussions of biblical interpretation and the nature of divine self-disclosure.
