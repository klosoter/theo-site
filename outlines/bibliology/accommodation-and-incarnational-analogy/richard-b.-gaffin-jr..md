# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches **accommodation** and **incarnational analogy** through the lens of **Reformed doctrine**, emphasizing the unity of **divine revelation** and the **humanity of Scripture**. He insists that just as the **incarnation** involves the union of divine and human natures in Christ, so too does Scripture reflect both divine authorship and genuine human expression, without confusion or division.

- "The analogy between the incarnate Word and the inscripturated Word is not merely illustrative but is grounded in the reality of revelation itself." ("God's Word in Servant-Form," in The Trustworthiness of God)

## Key Works

- "God's Word in Servant-Form: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck on the Doctrine of Scripture" (in The Trustworthiness of God)
- "The Vitality of Reformed Dogmatics" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (especially sections on revelation and Christology)
- "Perspectives on Pentecost" (for implications of revelation and the Spirit)
- "Revelation and Tradition: The Structure of Biblical Authority" (in Revelation and Reason)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Both Divine and Human**
   - Scripture is fully **inspired** by God yet genuinely expresses human authorship.
   - The **incarnational analogy** frames the relationship: as Christ is fully God and fully man, so Scripture is both divine and human.
   - Human language and cultural context are not obstacles but means of revelation.
   - The integrity of both natures (divine and human) must be maintained without confusion or separation.
   - "The incarnational analogy is not a concession to human weakness but a necessary mode of revelation." ("God's Word in Servant-Form")

2. **Accommodation as Faithful Divine Self-Disclosure**
   - God accommodates Himself to human limitations in order to communicate truly.
   - Accommodation does not imply error or compromise in revelation.
   - The process is analogous to the Son's taking on human nature in the incarnation.
   - Divine accommodation is an act of grace, ensuring accessibility and reliability of revelation.
   - "Accommodation is not a lowering of truth but its fitting expression in servant form." ("God's Word in Servant-Form")

3. **Organic Inspiration**
   - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but a dynamic, organic process.
   - The Holy Spirit works through the personalities, styles, and contexts of human authors.
   - The result is a text that is both fully divine and authentically human.
   - This organic view parallels the hypostatic union in Christology.
   - "The Spirit’s work in inspiration is analogous to the Spirit’s work in the incarnation." (WTJ, "The Vitality of Reformed Dogmatics")

4. **Unity of Redemptive-Historical Revelation**
   - Revelation unfolds progressively in history, culminating in Christ.
   - The incarnational analogy helps explain the continuity and diversity within Scripture.
   - Both Old and New Testaments are united in their witness to Christ.
   - The analogy safeguards against fragmenting revelation or reducing it to mere human testimony.
   - "The unity of revelation is anchored in the unity of the incarnate Word and the inscripturated Word." ("Revelation and Tradition")

5. **Authority and Trustworthiness of Scripture**
   - The divine-human character of Scripture undergirds its authority.
   - Accommodation and incarnational analogy do not undermine inerrancy.
   - Scripture’s trustworthiness is rooted in the faithfulness of God Himself.
   - The analogy supports a high view of Scripture’s reliability for faith and practice.
   - "The authority of Scripture is inseparable from its incarnational character." ("God's Word in Servant-Form")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **incarnational analogy** has shaped contemporary Reformed understanding of **Scripture’s divine and human dimensions**. His work has provided a robust theological framework for affirming both the authority and the genuine humanity of the biblical text. By rooting accommodation in the very nature of revelation and the incarnation, Gaffin has influenced generations of scholars and pastors, especially within the Westminster tradition. His contributions continue to inform debates on **inspiration**, **inerrancy**, and the nature of biblical authority.
