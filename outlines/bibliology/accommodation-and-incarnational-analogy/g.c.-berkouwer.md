# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the issues of **accommodation** and **incarnational analogy** with a strong emphasis on the dynamic relationship between **divine revelation** and human reception. He argued that God's self-disclosure in Scripture is genuinely **historical** and **contextual**, yet without compromising the **truthfulness** or **authority** of revelation. For Berkouwer, the analogy of the **incarnation** serves as a model for understanding how the infinite God communicates within finite, human categories.

- "The incarnation is not a model for a reduction of truth, but for the reality of God's coming to us in our own situation." (Holy Scripture)

## Key Works

- Holy Scripture (De Heilige Schrift)
- General Revelation (Algemene Openbaring)
- The Person of Christ
- Studies in Dogmatics (series)
- The Work of Christ

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation is a mode of divine condescension**
    - God’s revelation is always adapted to human capacity without loss of divine truth.
    - Accommodation reflects God’s gracious initiative, not human limitation imposed on God.
    - The concept safeguards the **perspicuity** and **reliability** of Scripture.
    - Accommodation is not a concession to error but a means of genuine communication.
    - "Accommodation is not a lowering of truth, but a form of God’s approach to man." (Holy Scripture)

2. **Incarnational analogy shapes revelation**
    - The incarnation of Christ is the paradigm for understanding how God speaks in Scripture.
    - Divine revelation enters history without ceasing to be divine.
    - The analogy guards against both docetism (denial of true humanity) and adoptionism (denial of true divinity) in revelation.
    - Scripture’s humanity does not negate its **divine authority**.
    - "The analogy of the incarnation helps us to avoid a false dilemma between divinity and humanity in Scripture." (Holy Scripture)

3. **Revelation is historically embedded**
    - God’s Word comes through real historical events and human language.
    - The historical context is not a barrier but the very medium of revelation.
    - The particularities of history do not relativize the universality of God’s message.
    - The **redemptive-historical** character of revelation is essential for understanding accommodation.
    - "God’s revelation is not abstract, but comes to us in the concreteness of history." (Holy Scripture)

4. **Scripture’s authority is not diminished by accommodation**
    - The authority of Scripture is rooted in its divine origin, not in the avoidance of human forms.
    - Accommodation does not entail error or mythologizing.
    - The trustworthiness of Scripture is maintained even as it speaks in culturally conditioned ways.
    - The **self-attestation** of Scripture is compatible with its accommodated form.
    - "The authority of Scripture is not threatened by its human form, but is confirmed in it." (Holy Scripture)

5. **Rejection of dualism between divine and human in revelation**
    - Berkouwer resists separating the divine and human aspects of revelation.
    - The unity of the divine message and human form is analogous to the unity of Christ’s natures.
    - Dualistic approaches lead to skepticism or docetism regarding Scripture.
    - The incarnational analogy affirms both the full divinity and full humanity of revelation.
    - "We must not posit a dualism between the divine and the human, but see their unity in revelation." (Holy Scripture)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced articulation of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** has influenced Reformed approaches to **biblical authority** and **hermeneutics**, especially in the context of modern challenges to Scripture’s reliability. His work provided a mediating position between rigid inerrantism and liberal reductionism, emphasizing the dynamic, historical, and personal nature of revelation. Berkouwer’s legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the relationship between divine truth and human language in theological method.
