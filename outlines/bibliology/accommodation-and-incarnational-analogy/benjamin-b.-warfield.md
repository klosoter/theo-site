# Benjamin B. Warfield (1851–1921)

Benjamin B. Warfield articulated a robust doctrine of **divine accommodation** grounded in the **inspiration** and **inerrancy** of Scripture, emphasizing that God communicates truth through human language and historical context without compromising His own perfection. Warfield employed the **incarnational analogy** to illustrate how the **divine and human** aspects of Scripture coexist, much like the two natures of Christ, ensuring that revelation is both accessible and authoritative.

- "The incarnation of the Son of God is the supreme example of the accommodation of God to the conditions of human life." ("The Biblical Idea of Revelation")

## Key Works

- "The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible"
- "Revelation and Inspiration"
- "The Biblical Idea of Revelation"
- "The Divine and Human in the Bible" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- Selected articles in The Presbyterian and Reformed Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation is Divine Condescension**
   - God adapts His revelation to human limitations without error or loss of truth.
   - Accommodation is not deception but a gracious act of **condescension**.
   - Scripture’s human form is a necessary means for true communication.
   - Warfield distinguishes accommodation from any notion of doctrinal compromise.
   - "God speaks to men in human words, because only so can He speak to them at all." ("The Biblical Idea of Revelation")

2. **Incarnational Analogy for Scripture**
   - The union of **divine and human** in Scripture mirrors the hypostatic union in Christ.
   - Both natures are present without confusion, division, or diminution.
   - The human authors’ personalities and contexts are fully engaged, yet the product remains fully **divine**.
   - This analogy safeguards both the authority and accessibility of revelation.
   - "As Christ was both God and man, so the Scriptures are both divine and human." ("The Divine and Human in the Bible")

3. **Organic Inspiration**
   - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but an organic process involving the whole person of the human author.
   - The Holy Spirit superintends the process to ensure **inerrancy**.
   - Human faculties, styles, and historical settings are genuinely operative.
   - The result is a text that is fully trustworthy as the Word of God.
   - "The Scriptures are the product of divine inspiration, organically given through human agents." ("The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible")

4. **Rejection of Errancy in Accommodation**
   - Accommodation does not entail acceptance of error or myth in Scripture.
   - Warfield opposes views that see accommodation as a concession to ancient ignorance.
   - The divine message remains uncorrupted despite adaptation to human context.
   - He insists on the **infallibility** of revelation, even in accommodated forms.
   - "Accommodation is not the admission of error, but the adaptation of truth to human capacity." ("Revelation and Inspiration")

5. **Scripture as Both Culturally Situated and Universally Authoritative**
   - The Bible’s message is expressed in the idioms and categories of its original audience.
   - This cultural particularity does not limit its **universal authority**.
   - Warfield affirms the ongoing relevance of Scripture for all times and places.
   - The incarnational model explains how Scripture transcends its immediate context.
   - "The Bible is the Word of God given in the words of men in history." ("The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** has profoundly shaped Reformed understandings of **Scripture’s authority** and humanity. His insistence on the organic, non-mechanical nature of inspiration provided a theological framework that preserves both the divine origin and human character of the biblical text. Warfield’s legacy endures in contemporary debates over inerrancy and hermeneutics, where his careful distinctions continue to inform evangelical and Reformed scholarship.
