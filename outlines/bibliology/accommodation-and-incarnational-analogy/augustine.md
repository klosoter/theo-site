# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s approach to **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** is rooted in his understanding of God’s self-revelation within the limits of human language and history. He emphasizes that **Scripture** and the **Incarnation** both involve God stooping to human weakness, using forms and expressions accessible to finite minds, while never compromising divine truth. This perspective shapes his doctrine of **revelation** and his interpretation of biblical texts.

- "For who would be so foolish as to send his son to school to learn what the teacher wishes to teach, and yet find fault with the teacher because he speaks in a manner intelligible to children?" (On Christian Doctrine, 2.6.8)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Accommodation in Revelation**
    - God adapts His communication to human limitations.
    - Scripture employs human language, metaphors, and cultural forms.
    - Accommodation is an act of divine mercy, not deception.
    - The purpose is to make **divine truth** accessible without diminishing its content.
    - "God, in order to be understood by men, has clothed Himself in the language of men." (On Christian Doctrine, 2.6.8)

2. **Incarnational Analogy**
    - The **Incarnation** is the supreme example of accommodation.
    - Christ’s taking on flesh parallels God’s use of human words in Scripture.
    - Both involve condescension without loss of divinity or truth.
    - The analogy shapes Augustine’s understanding of how God relates to creation.
    - "The Word was made flesh, that our infirmity might be carried, not that His majesty might be impaired." (Sermon 187)

3. **Scripture’s Humanity and Divinity**
    - Scripture is both a divine and human product.
    - Human authors’ personalities and contexts are evident in the text.
    - The Holy Spirit ensures the truthfulness and authority of Scripture.
    - The dual nature of Scripture reflects the dual nature of Christ.
    - "The Scriptures are the letters of God to us, adapted to our weakness." (Expositions on the Psalms, 56.1)

4. **Hermeneutics of Charity and Humility**
    - Readers must approach Scripture with humility, recognizing their limitations.
    - The principle of **love** guides interpretation, reflecting God’s accommodating purpose.
    - Difficult passages are opportunities for growth in understanding and virtue.
    - Augustine’s hermeneutic resists prideful speculation and demands dependence on God.
    - "Whoever, therefore, thinks that he understands the divine Scriptures or any part of them so that it does not build the double love of God and of our neighbor does not understand it at all." (On Christian Doctrine, 1.36.40)

5. **Progressive Revelation**
    - God’s revelation unfolds gradually, suited to humanity’s historical development.
    - The Old Testament contains shadows and types, clarified in Christ.
    - Accommodation explains the presence of anthropomorphisms and “hard” texts.
    - The fullness of revelation is found in the person and work of Christ.
    - "The New Testament is hidden in the Old; the Old is made manifest in the New." (Questions on the Heptateuch, 2.73)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s doctrine of **accommodation** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, influencing both medieval and Reformation approaches to **Scripture** and **Christology**. His use of the **incarnational analogy** provided a theological framework for understanding the relationship between divine revelation and human language. Later theologians, including Calvin and the Reformers, drew on Augustine’s insights to articulate doctrines of inspiration and hermeneutics. His emphasis on humility and charity in interpretation remains foundational for contemporary biblical theology.
