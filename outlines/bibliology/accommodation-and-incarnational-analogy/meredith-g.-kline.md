# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline advanced a distinctive understanding of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** within the doctrine of Scripture, emphasizing the way divine revelation is communicated through culturally and historically situated forms. He argued that God’s self-disclosure is always **covenantal**, employing human language and ancient Near Eastern forms as a mode of **condescension**. For Kline, the analogy between the **incarnation of Christ** and the **inscripturation** of the Word underscores both the full divinity and genuine humanity of Scripture.

- "The Word of God comes to man in the form of a covenant document, accommodated to the capacities of the human recipients." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation as Divine Condescension**
    - God reveals himself using forms and language familiar to the original audience.
    - Accommodation is not a concession to error but a gracious act of **covenantal communication**.
    - The ancient Near Eastern treaty form is a primary example of accommodation in Scripture.
    - Divine accommodation preserves both the transcendence and immanence of God.
    - "God’s revelation is always an act of condescension, taking form in the cultural and historical context of the recipients." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

2. **Covenantal Structure of Revelation**
    - All revelation is mediated through **covenant**, shaping both content and form.
    - The Bible’s literary forms mirror ancient suzerainty treaties, reflecting God’s sovereign initiative.
    - The **covenant document** is both divine and human, analogous to the two natures of Christ.
    - The authority of Scripture is inseparable from its covenantal character.
    - "The Scriptures are the documentary embodiment of the covenant relationship." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

3. **Incarnational Analogy for Scripture**
    - The **incarnation** of Christ provides the model for understanding the dual nature of Scripture.
    - Scripture is fully divine in origin and fully human in form and expression.
    - The analogy safeguards against both docetism (denying humanity) and adoptionism (denying divinity) in bibliology.
    - The **Word written** participates in the same mystery as the **Word made flesh**.
    - "The incarnational analogy helps us appreciate the full humanity and full divinity of the biblical text." (Images of the Spirit)

4. **Organic Inspiration**
    - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but a dynamic, organic process.
    - Human authors’ personalities, vocabularies, and historical contexts are genuinely operative.
    - The Spirit superintends the process, ensuring the text is both human and infallibly divine.
    - Organic inspiration aligns with the **incarnational analogy**, emphasizing unity without confusion.
    - "The Spirit’s work in inspiration is analogous to his work in the incarnation—real, pervasive, yet non-coercive." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
    - Interpretation must account for the unfolding of revelation in history.
    - Accommodation and incarnational analogy are best understood within a **redemptive-historical** framework.
    - Typology and symbolism in Scripture reflect God’s progressive self-revelation.
    - The unity of Scripture is maintained through its covenantal and Christocentric structure.
    - "The history of redemption is the matrix in which the accommodated forms of revelation are to be understood." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s articulation of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** has significantly shaped Reformed approaches to the doctrine of Scripture, especially in relation to ancient Near Eastern backgrounds and covenant theology. His emphasis on the **covenantal structure** of revelation and the organic unity of the Bible has influenced generations of biblical theologians and exegetes. Kline’s work continues to be a touchstone for discussions on the nature of inspiration, hermeneutics, and the relationship between divine and human elements in Scripture.
