# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s approach to **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** is rooted in his conviction that God reveals Himself through **Scripture** in ways accessible to human understanding, supremely in the **incarnation of Christ**. For Luther, divine self-disclosure always involves God “clothing” Himself in human words and forms, so that the infinite becomes knowable without ceasing to be divine. This dynamic is central to his doctrine of **the Word**, both written and incarnate.

- "God speaks with us in the Scriptures as one speaks with a child." (Table Talk)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis
- The Bondage of the Will
- Luther’s Prefaces to the Bible
- Sermons on John’s Gospel
- Table Talk

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Self-Revelation is Accommodated**
    - God adapts His communication to human limitations, using ordinary language and imagery.
    - Accommodation is not a concession to error, but a gracious act enabling true knowledge of God.
    - The **Scriptures** are the primary locus of this accommodated revelation.
    - Luther sees accommodation as necessary due to human finitude and sin.
    - "God must clothe Himself in our language, otherwise we cannot understand Him." (Table Talk)

2. **The Incarnation as the Supreme Analogy**
    - The **incarnation** is the ultimate example of God accommodating Himself to humanity.
    - Christ’s humanity does not diminish His divinity, but makes God accessible.
    - The pattern of the Word becoming flesh shapes Luther’s understanding of all revelation.
    - The incarnational analogy undergirds Luther’s sacramental theology, especially the **Lord’s Supper**.
    - "He who would find God must look into the manger and the cross." (Sermons on John)

3. **The Hiddenness and Revealedness of God**
    - God is both **Deus absconditus** (hidden God) and **Deus revelatus** (revealed God).
    - Accommodation bridges the gap between God’s transcendence and His presence in history.
    - The cross is the paradoxical locus of God’s self-revelation and concealment.
    - Human reason cannot penetrate God’s essence apart from His accommodated revelation.
    - "God reveals Himself under the opposite, in weakness and foolishness." (Heidelberg Disputation)

4. **The Word as Vehicle of Accommodation**
    - The **Word of God** comes to us in human speech, yet remains divine in power and authority.
    - Luther emphasizes the external, preached Word as the means by which God addresses sinners.
    - The written and spoken Word are both forms of God’s accommodated self-communication.
    - The Spirit works through the Word, not apart from its human form.
    - "The Holy Spirit is not given apart from the external Word." (Preface to the Psalms)

5. **Faith Receives the Accommodated Revelation**
    - Faith is the means by which believers apprehend God’s accommodated self-disclosure.
    - The humility of faith corresponds to the humility of God’s revelation in Christ and Scripture.
    - Faith trusts God’s promises even when they come in lowly, veiled forms.
    - The incarnational analogy shapes Luther’s doctrine of justification by faith alone.
    - "Faith clings to the Word, even when it appears weak or foolish." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s theology of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** profoundly shaped Protestant understandings of **revelation** and **Scripture**. His insistence on God’s self-humbling in both Word and flesh provided a model for later Reformed and Lutheran thought, influencing debates on biblical authority and hermeneutics. Luther’s emphasis on the paradox of divine hiddenness and revelation continues to inform contemporary discussions of the relationship between transcendence and immanence in Christian theology.
