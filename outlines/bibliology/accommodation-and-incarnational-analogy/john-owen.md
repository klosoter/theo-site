# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen’s doctrine of **accommodation** is rooted in his high view of **Scripture’s inspiration** and the **condescension** of God in revelation. He employs an **incarnational analogy** to explain how divine truth is communicated through human language, emphasizing that God adapts his self-disclosure to the limitations of human understanding without compromising the **divine authority** or **inerrancy** of Scripture.

- "God is pleased to speak unto us 'as unto children,' in a manner suited unto our weakness and capacity." ("The Reason of Faith")

## Key Works

- "The Reason of Faith"
- "Biblical Theology"
- "The Divine Original of the Scriptures"
- "A Discourse Concerning the Holy Spirit"
- "The Works of John Owen" (esp. Volumes 4 and 16)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation as Divine Condescension**
    - God reveals himself by stooping to human limitations.
    - Accommodation is an act of **grace**, not a concession to error.
    - The language of Scripture is shaped by human modes of thought.
    - Divine truth remains unaltered despite adaptation.
    - "God, in infinite condescension, accommodates the expressions of his mind and will unto our weakness." ("The Reason of Faith")

2. **Incarnational Analogy in Revelation**
    - The union of divine and human in Scripture parallels the **hypostatic union**.
    - Human language serves as the vehicle for divine communication.
    - The analogy safeguards both the **divinity** and **humanity** of Scripture.
    - This model avoids both docetism (denial of humanity) and adoptionism (denial of divinity) in bibliology.
    - "As the eternal Word was made flesh, so the Word of God is delivered unto us in human words." ("The Divine Original of the Scriptures")

3. **Organic Inspiration**
    - The Spirit superintends the human authors without overriding their faculties.
    - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but a providential guidance.
    - Human authors’ personalities and contexts are preserved.
    - The result is a fully **divine** and fully **human** text.
    - "The Holy Ghost did not use the penmen of the Scripture as irrational instruments, but as rational agents." ("The Reason of Faith")

4. **Scripture’s Clarity and Authority**
    - Accommodation does not undermine the **perspicuity** of Scripture.
    - The adapted form is sufficient for saving knowledge.
    - Authority is grounded in the divine source, not the mode of delivery.
    - The clarity of Scripture is compatible with its accommodated form.
    - "The Scripture is plain in all things necessary unto salvation, though delivered in expressions suited to our capacity." ("The Reason of Faith")

5. **Rejection of Errancy in Accommodation**
    - Accommodation does not entail the presence of error in Scripture.
    - God’s adaptation is always truthful and reliable.
    - Human limitations are addressed, not human misconceptions endorsed.
    - The **inerrancy** of Scripture is maintained alongside accommodation.
    - "There is no accommodation of divine truth to the errors of men in the Scripture, but only to their capacity." ("The Divine Original of the Scriptures")

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s robust articulation of **accommodation** and his use of the **incarnational analogy** have shaped Reformed approaches to **Scripture’s inspiration** and hermeneutics. His insistence on the integrity of both the divine and human aspects of revelation influenced later orthodox treatments of biblical authority. Owen’s careful distinctions continue to inform debates on **inerrancy**, **clarity**, and the nature of **revelation** in contemporary theology.
