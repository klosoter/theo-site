# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a **Reformed confessional** approach to **divine revelation**, emphasizing that God accommodates Himself to human limitations through **Scripture** and ultimately in the **incarnation of Christ**. The documents affirm that God's self-disclosure is both **authoritative** and **adapted** to human understanding, employing **incarnational analogy** to explain how the infinite God makes Himself known in finite terms.

- "We know Him by two means: first, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe... second, He makes Himself more clearly and fully known to us by His holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 2–7, 18
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 19, 31, 33, 122
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. I.6, III/IV.6–7
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Beets, 1983)
- The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism: A Reformation Synthesis (Lyle Bierma)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation in Divine Revelation**
   - God reveals Himself in ways suited to human capacity.
   - **Scripture** uses human language and concepts to communicate divine truth.
   - Accommodation does not compromise the **truthfulness** or **authority** of revelation.
   - The finite cannot fully comprehend the infinite, necessitating divine adaptation.
   - "We confess that this Word of God was not sent nor delivered by the will of man, but that holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit." (Belgic Confession, Art. 3)

2. **Incarnational Analogy in Christology**
   - The **incarnation** is the supreme example of God accommodating Himself to humanity.
   - Christ is both fully God and fully man, uniting divine and human natures.
   - The mystery of the incarnation models how God’s revelation comes in human form.
   - The analogy underscores the reliability and humility of God’s self-disclosure.
   - "Therefore we confess... that He assumed the true human nature, with all its infirmities, sin excepted, being conceived in the womb of the blessed Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit." (Belgic Confession, Art. 18)

3. **Authority and Clarity of Scripture**
   - **Scripture** is the ultimate standard for faith and life.
   - The clarity of Scripture is sufficient for salvation, despite accommodation.
   - Human language does not obscure but communicates God’s will effectively.
   - The Spirit illumines the accommodated Word for true understanding.
   - "We believe that this Holy Scripture fully contains the will of God, and that whatever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

4. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
   - God is transcendent and distinct from creation.
   - Accommodation preserves the **Creator-creature distinction** without collapsing it.
   - Human knowledge of God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
   - The forms of revelation respect God’s majesty and human finitude.
   - "We know Him... by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe; which is before our eyes as a most elegant book." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

5. **Covenantal Context of Revelation**
   - God’s accommodation is covenantal, aiming at relationship and redemption.
   - The **covenant of grace** is progressively revealed through accommodated means.
   - The incarnational analogy is central to understanding covenant fulfillment in Christ.
   - The sacraments are visible words, further accommodating divine grace to human senses.
   - "God Himself first revealed Himself to our forefathers, and later, by His holy and divine Word, more clearly and fully." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 19)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have shaped **Reformed confessional identity** by grounding the doctrines of **revelation** and **incarnation** in the principles of accommodation and analogy. Their articulation of these themes has influenced later Reformed theology, especially in discussions of **Scripture’s authority** and the nature of **Christ’s person**. By emphasizing both the transcendence and immanence of God, these confessions continue to inform contemporary debates on how God makes Himself known in history and language.
