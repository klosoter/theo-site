# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos advanced a theology of **revelation** that emphasized both **divine accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy**, understanding **Scripture** as God's self-disclosure through human authors in real historical contexts. He insisted that revelation is unified, authoritative, and unfolds progressively within the framework of **redemptive history**.

- "Revelation is always adapted to the stage of history in which it is given and to the capacity of those to whom it is addressed." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "The Self-Disclosure of Jesus" (in The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church)
- "The Doctrine of Revelation in the Old Testament" (Princeton Theological Review)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Progressive and Accommodated**
    - God reveals Himself in stages, adapting His communication to human capacity.
    - Accommodation does not compromise the **truthfulness** or **authority** of revelation.
    - The form of revelation is conditioned by historical and cultural context.
    - The principle of accommodation safeguards the unity of **redemptive history**.
    "The principle of accommodation is not a lowering of truth, but a fitting of truth to the needs of man." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Incarnational Analogy in Scripture**
    - The union of divine and human elements in Scripture parallels the **incarnation** of Christ.
    - Scripture is fully divine in origin and fully human in expression.
    - The incarnational analogy preserves both the **infallibility** and the genuine humanity of the biblical text.
    - This analogy underscores the organic, not mechanical, nature of inspiration.
    "As in the incarnation, so in Scripture, the human is the organ of the divine." (Reformed Dogmatics)

3. **Organic Inspiration**
    - Inspiration is not dictation but a dynamic, organic process.
    - Human authors retain their personalities, styles, and historical situatedness.
    - The Spirit superintends the process to ensure the **inerrancy** of Scripture.
    - Organic inspiration aligns with the broader pattern of God's dealings in history.
    "The Spirit does not suppress the human, but uses it as an instrument for the divine." (Reformed Dogmatics)

4. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Revelation unfolds according to a unified, divine plan centered on **Christ**.
    - Accommodation serves the progressive unveiling of the **covenant**.
    - The incarnational analogy highlights the continuity between Old and New Testaments.
    - The unity of Scripture is rooted in the unity of God's redemptive purpose.
    "The history of revelation is the history of redemption." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Theological Epistemology Rooted in Revelation**
    - Human knowledge of God depends on God's self-disclosure.
    - Accommodation is necessary due to the Creator-creature distinction.
    - The incarnational analogy affirms that true knowledge of God is possible through accommodated revelation.
    - Vos rejects rationalism and mysticism in favor of a **revelational epistemology**.
    "All knowledge of God rests on revelation, and all revelation is accommodated." (Reformed Dogmatics)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** has profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to **biblical theology** and the doctrine of Scripture. His organic model of inspiration and emphasis on redemptive history provided a framework for understanding the unity and diversity of the biblical canon. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of revelation, inspiration, and hermeneutics, especially within confessional Reformed circles.
