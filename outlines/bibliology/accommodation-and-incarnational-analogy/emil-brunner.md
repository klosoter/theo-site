# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner developed a distinctive approach to **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** within the framework of **dialectical theology**. He emphasized the necessity of God's self-revelation adapting to human limitations, while insisting that the **Word becomes flesh** in a way that both veils and unveils divine truth. Brunner’s theology underscores the paradoxical nature of revelation, where God’s communication is both genuinely divine and truly accessible to finite, sinful humanity.

- "God’s revelation is always an accommodation to the human situation, a condescension of the eternal to the temporal." ("The Divine-Human Encounter")

## Key Works

- "The Divine-Human Encounter" (1943)
- "Revelation and Reason" (1946)
- "The Christian Doctrine of God" (1946)
- "The Mediator" (1934)
- "Dogmatics, Vol. I: The Christian Doctrine of God" (1949)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Divine Accommodation**
    - God’s self-disclosure is always adapted to human finitude and sinfulness.
    - Accommodation is not deception but a necessary act of divine love.
    - Revelation is never a direct unveiling of God’s essence but always mediated.
    - Human language and concepts are used by God to communicate truth analogically.
    - "God reveals Himself by veiling Himself, adapting His Word to our capacity." ("Revelation and Reason")

2. **Incarnational Analogy in Revelation**
    - The incarnation is the supreme model for understanding all divine accommodation.
    - God’s Word becomes flesh, uniting the divine and human without confusion.
    - All revelation participates analogically in the logic of the incarnation.
    - The analogy preserves both the transcendence and immanence of God.
    - "The Incarnation is the clue to all revelation: God’s coming to man in a form he can receive." ("The Mediator")

3. **Rejection of Purely Propositional Revelation**
    - Revelation is fundamentally personal and relational, not merely doctrinal.
    - Truth is encountered in the event of divine-human meeting, not abstract statements.
    - Propositional content serves the relational encounter but is not its essence.
    - The incarnational analogy resists reducing revelation to static formulas.
    - "Revelation is not the communication of truths, but the meeting of persons." ("The Divine-Human Encounter")

4. **Analogy and the Limits of Human Knowledge**
    - Human knowledge of God is always analogical, never univocal.
    - The gap between Creator and creature is bridged by God’s initiative, not human ascent.
    - Analogy safeguards both the reality and the mystery of revelation.
    - Accommodation ensures that revelation is true, though never exhaustive.
    - "We know God only in the analogy of faith, never in direct apprehension." ("Dogmatics, Vol. I")

5. **Christocentric Focus of Accommodation**
    - Jesus Christ is the definitive act of divine accommodation.
    - All revelation is interpreted through the person and work of Christ.
    - The incarnational analogy finds its center in the cross and resurrection.
    - Christ mediates both the veiling and unveiling of God’s self-revelation.
    - "In Christ, God’s accommodation reaches its climax and its fulfillment." ("The Mediator")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s articulation of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** significantly shaped 20th-century Protestant thought, especially within the Neo-Orthodox movement. His insistence on the paradox and relational nature of revelation influenced later discussions on the limits of theological language and the nature of **divine self-disclosure**. Brunner’s work remains a touchstone for debates on how God’s transcendence and immanence are held together in revelation, and his Christocentric approach continues to inform contemporary theology.
