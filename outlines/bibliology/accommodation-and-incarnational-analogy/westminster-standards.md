# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a doctrine of **divine accommodation** rooted in the Creator-creature distinction, emphasizing that God reveals Himself in ways suited to human **finitude** and **sinfulness**. This accommodation is especially evident in the **incarnation of Christ**, which serves as the supreme analogy for how God makes Himself known in **Scripture** and **redemptive history**. The Standards uphold that God's self-disclosure is always true, yet necessarily **condescending** to human capacity.

- "The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God's part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of covenant." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 1, 7, 8)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 36–40, 55–57)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 21–23)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on the reading and preaching of Scripture)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on the covenant of grace)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Accommodation is Necessary**
    - God’s infinite majesty requires Him to reveal Himself in ways suited to human limitations.
    - All revelation is an act of **condescension**, not a surrender of divine truth.
    - Accommodation is not deception but a gracious adaptation.
    - The **covenant** is the primary mode of this accommodation.
    - "There is a distance to be acknowledged between God and the creature." (WCF 7.1)

2. **Scripture as Accommodated Revelation**
    - The Bible is the supreme means by which God accommodates His truth to humanity.
    - Human language and concepts are employed, yet the message remains infallible.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are maintained within this accommodation.
    - The Holy Spirit enables understanding despite human weakness.
    - "All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all." (WCF 1.7)

3. **Incarnation as the Supreme Analogy**
    - The **incarnation** is the ultimate act of divine accommodation.
    - Christ’s two natures illustrate how the infinite can be truly, yet not exhaustively, known.
    - The union of divine and human in Christ models God’s approach in revelation.
    - The person and work of Christ ground the possibility of true knowledge of God.
    - "The Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, did... take upon him man's nature." (WSC 21)

4. **Covenantal Mediation**
    - God’s accommodation is expressed through **covenant** relationships.
    - The **mediator** (Christ) bridges the gap between God and humanity.
    - The covenant of grace is the context for redemptive accommodation.
    - All benefits of revelation flow through the work of the mediator.
    - "The covenant of grace was made with Christ as the second Adam, and in him with all the elect as his seed." (WLC 31)

5. **Preservation of Divine Truth**
    - Accommodation does not compromise the **inerrancy** or authority of revelation.
    - God remains sovereign over the mode and content of His self-disclosure.
    - Human reception is enabled by the Spirit, ensuring the truth is preserved.
    - The analogy of faith governs interpretation, safeguarding doctrinal integrity.
    - "The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself." (WCF 1.9)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology’s** understanding of accommodation and the incarnational analogy, providing a robust framework for discussing how the infinite God makes Himself known to finite creatures. Their articulation of **covenantal condescension** and the centrality of the **incarnation** continues to inform debates on biblical interpretation, Christology, and the doctrine of revelation. The Standards’ careful balance of divine transcendence and immanence remains a touchstone for confessional Reformed communities worldwide.
