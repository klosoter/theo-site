# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge approached the doctrine of **accommodation** and the **incarnational analogy** with a strong commitment to the **verbal inspiration** and **inerrancy** of Scripture. He affirmed that God, in revealing Himself, adapts His communication to human capacities without compromising the truth or authority of **divine revelation**. Hodge saw the incarnation of Christ as a fitting analogy for understanding how the infinite God makes Himself known in finite, human language.

- "Revelation is not the communication of truths unknown before, but the communication of truths in a manner adapted to our faculties." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially chapters on Revelation and Inspiration)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans (relevant for his treatment of revelation)
- Princeton Review articles on the doctrine of Scripture
- The Way of Life (for his approach to Christology and revelation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation is Divine Condescension**
   - God adapts His revelation to human limitations without error or deception.
   - Accommodation is an act of **grace**, not a concession to human fallibility.
   - The form of revelation is suited to human understanding, but its content remains divine.
   - Hodge rejects any view of accommodation that implies the presence of error in Scripture.
   - "God, in making known his will, must speak in language intelligible to men." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Verbal Inspiration Safeguards Truth**
   - The **Holy Spirit** superintends the process of inspiration to ensure accuracy.
   - Accommodation does not undermine the **inerrancy** of Scripture.
   - Human authors are real agents, but their words are ultimately God's words.
   - The divine and human elements in Scripture are analogous to the two natures of Christ.
   - "The Scriptures are the word of God, written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Incarnational Analogy Clarifies Revelation**
   - The union of divine and human in Christ is a model for understanding Scripture’s dual authorship.
   - Just as Christ’s humanity did not diminish His divinity, Scripture’s humanity does not diminish its divinity.
   - The analogy upholds both the full deity and true humanity of Christ, and likewise, the divine and human in Scripture.
   - This analogy protects against both docetism (denying humanity) and adoptionism (denying divinity) in bibliology.
   - "The relation between the divine and human in the Scriptures is analogous to that in the person of Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Progressive Revelation and Historical Context**
   - God reveals Himself progressively, accommodating to the historical and cultural context of His people.
   - Earlier revelations are preparatory and partial, culminating in Christ.
   - The historical context shapes the form, but not the truth, of revelation.
   - Hodge insists that accommodation never entails doctrinal error or myth.
   - "Revelation is progressive, but never erroneous or misleading." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Rejection of Rationalistic and Liberal Accommodation**
   - Hodge opposes views that treat biblical accommodation as evidence of error or myth.
   - He critiques Schleiermacher and others who subordinate revelation to human reason.
   - For Hodge, accommodation is compatible with **objective, propositional revelation**.
   - He maintains the authority and sufficiency of Scripture against modernist reinterpretations.
   - "The Bible is not a record of human thoughts about God, but a revelation from God Himself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of **verbal inspiration** and his careful articulation of accommodation shaped the Princeton tradition and influenced generations of Reformed theologians. His use of the **incarnational analogy** provided a framework for understanding the dual authorship of Scripture that remains influential in conservative Reformed circles. While later theologians have nuanced or critiqued aspects of his approach, Hodge’s insistence on the reliability and authority of Scripture continues to inform contemporary debates on revelation and hermeneutics.
