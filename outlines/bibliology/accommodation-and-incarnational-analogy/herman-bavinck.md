# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck developed a robust doctrine of **accommodation** grounded in the reality of **divine revelation** and the **incarnation** of Christ. He argued that God’s self-disclosure is always adapted to human limitations, and that the **incarnational analogy**—God’s Word becoming flesh in Christ—serves as the model for understanding how Scripture communicates eternal truths in human language and history.

- "Revelation is always adapted to the measure of the creature, and in this accommodation God’s condescension is most gloriously revealed." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1:349)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation as Divine Condescension**
    - God’s revelation is always adapted to the finite capacities of human beings.
    - Accommodation is not deception but a gracious act of **condescension**.
    - The language and forms of Scripture reflect the historical and cultural context of its recipients.
    - Accommodation preserves both the **sovereignty** and **immanence** of God.
    - "God accommodates himself to the level of the creature, not by diminishing his truth, but by adapting its form." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1:349)

2. **Incarnational Analogy in Revelation**
    - The incarnation of Christ is the supreme example of divine accommodation.
    - Just as Christ is fully God and fully man, Scripture is both fully divine and fully human.
    - The **incarnational analogy** explains how eternal truth can be communicated through temporal means.
    - This analogy safeguards the unity and reliability of **special revelation**.
    - "The incarnation of the Word is the model for all revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1:352)

3. **Organic Inspiration of Scripture**
    - Inspiration is not mechanical but organic, involving the whole person of the biblical authors.
    - The human authors’ personalities, styles, and historical situations are genuinely present in Scripture.
    - The Spirit superintends the process, ensuring the truth and authority of the text.
    - This view upholds both the **divinity** and **humanity** of Scripture.
    - "The Holy Spirit did not suppress the individuality of the authors, but sanctified and used it." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1:430)

4. **Unity of General and Special Revelation**
    - God reveals himself both in nature (**general revelation**) and in Scripture (**special revelation**).
    - Both forms of revelation are accommodated to human understanding.
    - The incarnational analogy bridges the gap between creation and redemption.
    - This unity affirms the coherence of God’s self-disclosure in all spheres.
    - "All revelation is one in principle, differing only in mode and degree." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1:307)

5. **Rejection of Rationalism and Mysticism**
    - Bavinck rejects both rationalist reduction of revelation to human reason and mystical detachment from history.
    - True knowledge of God is possible only through God’s accommodated self-revelation.
    - The incarnational analogy resists both extremes by rooting revelation in history and personhood.
    - This approach maintains the **objectivity** and **historicity** of revelation.
    - "God’s revelation is historical, personal, and objective, never a product of human speculation." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1:360)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s doctrine of **accommodation** and his use of the **incarnational analogy** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of revelation and Scripture. His organic and Christological approach provided a mediating path between liberal and fundamentalist views, influencing later theologians such as G.C. Berkouwer and contemporary discussions on biblical authority. Bavinck’s insights continue to inform debates on the relationship between divine transcendence and immanence, and the nature of **special revelation** in a modern context.
