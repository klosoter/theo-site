# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the issues of **accommodation** and **incarnational analogy** with a strong commitment to the **verbal inspiration** and **inerrancy** of Scripture, emphasizing that God's self-revelation is both fully divine and genuinely accessible to human understanding. He affirmed that while God accommodates Himself to human limitations, this does not entail any compromise of **divine truthfulness** or the **authority of Scripture**. Murray was cautious about analogies between the **incarnation of Christ** and the nature of Scripture, preferring to stress the uniqueness of each.

- "The divine accommodation in revelation is not a surrender of truth but the condescension of grace." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Key Works

- The Inspiration and Infallibility of the Holy Scriptures (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)
- Principles of Conduct
- The Epistle to the Romans
- "The Attestation of Scripture" (in The Infallible Word, co-authored)
- Redemption Accomplished and Applied

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Accommodation affirms divine condescension, not error**
   - God reveals Himself in ways suited to human capacity without compromising truth.
   - Accommodation is an act of **grace**, not a concession to human fallibility.
   - The language of Scripture is genuinely human yet fully trustworthy.
   - Divine accommodation safeguards, rather than undermines, **inerrancy**.
   - "Accommodation is not to be equated with the admission of error or myth." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

2. **Scripture’s inspiration is verbal and plenary**
   - Every word of Scripture is inspired by the Holy Spirit.
   - The human authors were fully engaged, yet their words are the very Word of God.
   - Inspiration extends to all parts of Scripture, not just doctrinal or moral sections.
   - The divine and human elements in Scripture are united without confusion or division.
   - "The inspiration of Scripture is not mechanical but organic and plenary." (The Infallible Word)

3. **Cautious use of incarnational analogy**
   - Murray recognized parallels between the incarnation and Scripture but warned against overextending the analogy.
   - The union of divine and human in Christ is unique and not identical to the union in Scripture.
   - The analogy may help illustrate the mystery of Scripture’s dual authorship but must not blur distinctions.
   - Christ’s sinlessness is not directly analogous to the inerrancy of Scripture.
   - "The analogy between the incarnation and Scripture must be handled with care lest we obscure the uniqueness of Christ." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

4. **Scripture’s authority is absolute and objective**
   - The Bible’s authority derives from its divine origin, not from human recognition.
   - Accommodation does not diminish the binding authority of Scripture.
   - The church’s task is to receive and submit to the Word, not to judge it.
   - Objective authority is essential for the church’s faith and practice.
   - "The authority of Scripture is not contingent upon our understanding or acceptance." (The Infallible Word)

5. **Revelation is both historical and redemptive**
   - God’s self-disclosure unfolds in the context of real history.
   - Accommodation is evident in the progressive nature of revelation.
   - The incarnational pattern is seen in God’s acts and words within redemptive history.
   - The fullness of revelation culminates in Christ, the Word incarnate.
   - "Revelation is always adapted to the historical situation but never at the expense of its redemptive purpose." (Principles of Conduct)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s careful articulation of **accommodation** and his nuanced approach to the **incarnational analogy** have shaped Reformed discussions on the doctrine of Scripture, especially regarding its **inspiration** and **authority**. His insistence on the integrity of both the divine and human elements in revelation has influenced generations of Westminster theologians. Murray’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to uphold the full trustworthiness of Scripture while acknowledging the reality of God’s gracious condescension.
