# Scott Oliphint (1961– )

Scott Oliphint is a contemporary Reformed theologian who strongly rejects the **analogia entis** (analogy of being) in favor of the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith), following the tradition of **Cornelius Van Til**. Oliphint insists that all true knowledge of God is possible only through **revelation** and that human reason, unaided by Scripture, cannot bridge the ontological gap between Creator and creature. He maintains that **covenantal epistemology** and the **Creator-creature distinction** are essential for a proper theological method.

- "There is no point of contact between God and man except that which God Himself establishes by His revelation." (Reasons for Faith)

## Key Works

- Reasons for Faith: Philosophy in the Service of Theology
- Covenantal Apologetics: Principles and Practice in Defense of Our Faith
- The Battle Belongs to the Lord: The Power of Scripture for Defending Our Faith
- "The Consistency of Van Til’s Methodology" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- God With Us: Divine Condescension and the Attributes of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of analogia entis**
    - Denies any natural or ontological analogy between God and creation apart from revelation.
    - Argues that the analogia entis undermines the **Creator-creature distinction**.
    - Sees the analogia entis as foundational to Roman Catholic and some neo-orthodox theologies, which he critiques.
    - Maintains that all knowledge of God must be grounded in **Scripture**.
    - "The analogia entis is not only unnecessary but theologically dangerous." (Reasons for Faith)

2. **Affirmation of analogia fidei**
    - Holds that knowledge of God is possible only through the analogy of faith, rooted in revelation.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of **Scripture** as the principium cognoscendi.
    - Insists that theological language must be governed by God's self-disclosure.
    - Connects analogia fidei to the Reformed tradition’s emphasis on **sola Scriptura**.
    - "The analogia fidei is the only safe ground for Christian theology." (Covenantal Apologetics)

3. **Covenantal epistemology**
    - Argues that all human knowledge is covenantally conditioned.
    - Believes that epistemology must be shaped by the **covenant relationship** between God and humanity.
    - Rejects any notion of autonomous human reason.
    - Insists that presuppositions are governed by one's covenantal status (in Adam or in Christ).
    - "All knowledge is covenantal; there is no neutral ground." (Covenantal Apologetics)

4. **Creator-creature distinction**
    - Maintains a sharp ontological distinction between God and creation.
    - Argues that this distinction is the foundation for all Reformed theology.
    - Warns that analogia entis blurs this distinction and leads to idolatry.
    - Upholds **incomprehensibility**: God is known truly but never exhaustively.
    - "The Creator-creature distinction is the sine qua non of Christian theology." (God With Us)

5. **Van Tilian presuppositionalism**
    - Follows Van Til in critiquing all forms of natural theology that rely on analogia entis.
    - Emphasizes the antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought.
    - Argues that only a presuppositional approach is faithful to the analogia fidei.
    - Sees apologetics as necessarily theological and revelational.
    - "Presuppositionalism is simply the consistent application of the analogia fidei." (Reasons for Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Oliphint has played a significant role in advancing **presuppositional apologetics** and reinforcing the Reformed critique of the analogia entis in contemporary theology. His work has shaped a new generation of Reformed thinkers to prioritize the **analogia fidei** and the **Creator-creature distinction** in both theology and apologetics. By articulating a robust covenantal epistemology, Oliphint has contributed to ongoing debates about the foundations of theological method and the limits of human reason in knowing God.
