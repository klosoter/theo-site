# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin firmly rejected the **analogia entis**—the idea that there is a formal analogy between God’s being and human being—insisting instead on the **analogia fidei**, where true knowledge of God is possible only through **divine revelation** and **faith**. For Calvin, the **Creator-creature distinction** is absolute, and any knowledge of God must be grounded in **Scripture** rather than speculative metaphysics. This stance shaped his approach to **theology proper** and the doctrine of **revelation**.

- "God in himself is incomprehensible; and the only knowledge of him that men can attain is by his works." (Institutes I.5.9)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I)
- Commentary on Romans
- Sermons on Job
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (ed. John T. McNeill)
- Calvin’s Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (T.H.L. Parker)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God’s essence is wholly other and cannot be grasped by human reason.
    - Any similarity between God and creation is by God’s condescension, not by shared being.
    - Human knowledge of God is always accommodated to our finite capacity.
    - Calvin denies any natural point of contact between God’s being and ours.
    - "We ought to contemplate God’s works, but never attempt to penetrate his essence." (Institutes I.5.9)

2. **Primacy of Divine Revelation**
    - True knowledge of God comes only through God’s self-disclosure in Scripture.
    - Human reason is insufficient for knowing God apart from revelation.
    - The Holy Spirit illumines the mind to receive divine truth.
    - Revelation is always particular and redemptive, not general or speculative.
    - "Scripture, gathering up the otherwise confused knowledge of God in our minds, dispels the darkness and gives us a clear view of the true God." (Institutes I.6.1)

3. **Rejection of Analogia Entis**
    - Calvin opposes the idea that there is an ontological analogy between God and humanity.
    - He views analogia entis as a form of idolatry, reducing God to human categories.
    - Knowledge of God is not based on shared being but on God’s gracious initiative.
    - Calvin’s theology is wary of speculative metaphysics and philosophical theology.
    - "It is not fitting to measure God by our own senses." (Institutes I.13.2)

4. **Analogia Fidei: Knowledge by Faith**
    - Faith is the means by which we apprehend God’s self-revelation.
    - The analogia fidei is grounded in the correspondence between God’s Word and our faith.
    - The Spirit creates the capacity for faith, not human nature itself.
    - All theological knowledge is subordinate to and derived from Scripture.
    - "The Word of God is the school of the Holy Spirit." (Institutes I.9.3)

5. **Accommodation in Divine Revelation**
    - God accommodates his revelation to human weakness and limitation.
    - Scriptural language is anthropomorphic, suited to our understanding.
    - Accommodation safeguards the transcendence and mystery of God.
    - This principle undergirds Calvin’s exegesis and doctrine of revelation.
    - "For who even of slight intelligence does not understand that, as nurses commonly do with infants, God is wont in a measure to ‘lisp’ in speaking to us?" (Institutes I.13.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s rejection of the **analogia entis** and his insistence on the **analogia fidei** have profoundly shaped the trajectory of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the absolute distinction between God and creation and the necessity of revelation for true knowledge of God. His approach influenced later Reformed theologians, including Karl Barth, who also opposed the analogia entis. Calvin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on **Scripture**, **faith**, and the **sovereignty of God** in all theological knowledge.
