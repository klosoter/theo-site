# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck firmly rejected the **analogia entis** as a basis for theological knowledge, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei**—the analogy of faith—whereby all true knowledge of God is grounded in **divine revelation** and interpreted through **Scripture**. For Bavinck, human knowledge of God is real yet analogical, always dependent on God's self-disclosure and never on an independent metaphysical similarity between Creator and creature.

- "Between God and us there is no similarity that is not at the same time a dissimilarity." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2:304)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- Philosophy of Revelation
- The Wonderful Works of God
- "The Catholicity of Christianity and the Church" (essay)
- Bavinck on the Christian Life: Following Jesus in Faithful Service (secondary, Bolt)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the analogia entis**
    - Bavinck critiques the **analogia entis** as a Roman Catholic concept that posits a metaphysical continuity between God and creation.
    - He argues that this approach undermines the **Creator-creature distinction** central to Reformed theology.
    - The analogia entis leads to natural theology that is independent of **special revelation**.
    - Bavinck insists that knowledge of God must be grounded in God's self-revelation, not in human metaphysical speculation.
    - "The doctrine of the analogia entis is the insurmountable obstacle to knowledge of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2:304)

2. **Primacy of the analogia fidei**
    - Bavinck upholds the **analogia fidei** as the only proper method for theological knowledge.
    - This analogy is rooted in the correspondence between **Scripture** and faith, not in being itself.
    - The analogia fidei maintains the transcendence of God while allowing for true knowledge through revelation.
    - It ensures that theology remains a discipline of faith, not autonomous reason.
    - "All our knowledge of God is derived from his revelation and is therefore analogical." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2:304)

3. **Creator-creature distinction**
    - Bavinck emphasizes the absolute qualitative distinction between God and creation.
    - Human language about God is always analogical, never univocal or purely equivocal.
    - This distinction safeguards both divine transcendence and immanence.
    - The **image of God** in humanity is a reflection, not an ontological participation in the divine essence.
    - "There is no univocal concept between God and the creature." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2:304)

4. **Revelation as the foundation of theology**
    - For Bavinck, all knowledge of God depends on **special revelation**.
    - Natural theology is possible only as it is illuminated and corrected by Scripture.
    - The **Word of God** is the norming norm for all theological reflection.
    - Revelation is both propositional and personal, culminating in Christ.
    - "Revelation is the presupposition, the foundation, and the content of all theology." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1:212)

5. **Analogy and mystery in theological language**
    - Bavinck affirms that analogical language preserves the mystery of God while enabling real knowledge.
    - The analogical relationship is grounded in God's act of creation and accommodation to human understanding.
    - Mystery is not a barrier but a necessary aspect of finite knowledge of the infinite.
    - Theological statements are true, yet always limited by the Creator-creature distinction.
    - "Mystery is the lifeblood of dogmatics." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2:29)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck's robust articulation of the **analogia fidei** has profoundly shaped modern Reformed theology, especially in its approach to **revelation** and the Creator-creature distinction. His critique of the analogia entis continues to influence discussions on natural theology and the limits of human reason in knowing God. Bavinck's careful balance of analogy and mystery has provided a durable framework for engaging both classical and contemporary theological challenges.
