### ESSAY
The conflict between analogia entis and analogia fidei turns on the possibility, ground, and scope of creaturely knowledge of the God who is absolutely unique. The core conceptual undertaking is to uphold **divine simplicity** and the **Creator-creature distinction** without collapsing theological language into either univocity that domesticates God or equivocity that renders revelation ineffable. Analogy promises a middle path, but the dispute concerns which analogy, where it is anchored, and how it authorizes theological judgments. I will argue that a Reformed account of **analogical knowledge** locates analogy not in a metaphysical scale of being that ascends to God, but in the asymmetrical relation of the triune Lord to his creatures through **creation**, **providence**, **covenant**, **general revelation**, and **special revelation**. On this account, analogy is real and cognitive, yet governed by the principle that God names himself and creatures signify him only as accommodated by his self-revelation. This preserves an ordered yet chastened **natural theology**, honors Romans 1, and avoids the twin perils of univocity and agnosticism.

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) supplies the classical architecture of analogia entis by integrating metaphysics and theology through participation. In the Summa Theologiae and De Veritate, he defends that names said of God and creatures are neither purely univocal nor purely equivocal but analogical. The metaphysical ground is his doctrine of act and potency, participation, and the distinction between essence and existence in creatures, with God as ipsum esse subsistens. For Aquinas, creatures possess real perfections by participation in God’s perfection as their exemplary and efficient cause. Predicates like good or wise reflect creaturely perfections that are real likenesses of God but finite and composite, whereas God possesses these perfections in a simple and identical way. Analogy here has two relevant modes. By analogy of attribution, a term is primarily predicated of one thing and secondarily of another by reference to that primary. By analogy of proportionality, a proportional similitude structures use across different orders, as sight in the eye corresponds to sight in the mind. Aquinas uses both to secure theological language that affirms real, though analogical, knowledge of God. His Five Ways are not independent proofs that extract God from created data as if God were a genus member. They advance from motion, causality, contingency, gradation, and teleology to a necessary cause whose simplicity and transcendence are inferred precisely because causal regress analysis discloses created dependence. In this framework, **natural theology** is neither autonomous nor exhaustive but a rational participation in the light of being that itself is created. The claim is that analogia entis, rightly construed, is a grammar for confessing that creatures speak truly of God without imperiling divine uniqueness.

The strengths of Aquinas are considerable for dogmatic coherence. **Divine simplicity** is safeguarded because every composite perfection in creatures reduces to the simple fullness of God. The **Creator-creature distinction** is maintained by the doctrine of participation which secures both likeness and greater unlikeness. And **general revelation** finds a principled account in the natural desire to know causes and the imprint of the divine in the order of creation. Yet the Thomistic legacy is not monolithic. Later Thomists such as Cajetan codified analogy into a technical taxonomy that sometimes occluded its dynamic in Aquinas, and debates over the nature-grace relation in modern Catholicism exposed fault lines. If nature is complete as a self-sufficient order, then analogy risks underwriting an extrinsicist grace that decks an independent creaturely metaphysics with supernatural elevation. If nature is intrinsically ordered to the vision of God, then analogy must be rethought in terms of created desire that both indicates and exceeds natural capacity.

Erich Przywara (1889–1972) is decisive for the modern fate of analogia entis because he reframed it not as a scholastic device but as the very rhythm of Christian metaphysics. In Analogia Entis he articulates the principle of similarity-in-greater-dissimilarity that John of the Fourth Lateran Council had expressed concisely. Przywara radicalizes Aquinas’s participation by insisting that the creature’s essence-existence composition places it in a perpetual tension of receptivity to the divine act that sustains it. Analogical being denotes a diapason between God’s transcendent absoluteness and the creature’s ever-dependent becoming. The energies of created orders, including cultural and historical life, all unfold within this creaturely dynamism of essence and existence, which is precisely where grace both perfects and judges nature. Przywara resists a closed nature and an extrinsic grace. His metaphysics intensifies the Creator-creature asymmetry while locating it interior to created finitude. Crucially, he rejects any univocal foothold of reason in God, yet he contends that metaphysics, precisely as metaphysics, is ordered to the theological because the very being of the creature is analogical. Theology thus does not despise metaphysics but renders it true to its own proper object.

Karl Barth (1886–1968) famously declared the analogia entis to be the invention of Antichrist. The polemic was directed especially at Przywara’s program, not Aquinas’s subtle texts abstractly considered, but the theological point was unambiguous. For Barth, any analogy grounded in being rather than in revelation inevitably claims a point of contact that grants man, as man, some capacity for God that is not strictly an act of grace given in Jesus Christ. In Church Dogmatics I.1, Barth reconstructs theology around God’s self-revelation, which is triune, Christocentric, and free. Revelation is not a datum within the created order. It is God’s self-interpreting act whereby God gives himself to be known in the Word and Spirit. In this light, analogia fidei names the correspondence established by the Holy Spirit between God’s Word and the hearing of faith. It is an analogia relationis grounded in the union of God and man in Christ and enacted in the obedient relation of the believer. For Barth, the order of knowing is not from being to God but from God’s act to the reconstitution of creaturely knowing. His famous Nein to Brunner on natural theology shows that the truth of **general revelation** cannot be abstracted into a natural religion. Every valid knowledge of God is knowledge of God in his self-revelation.

Barth’s reconstruction has strengths that should temper quick Protestant triumphalism over Catholic metaphysics. He places **covenant** at the center of the knowledge of God and insists that talk of God must be determined by God’s gracious self-giving in Christ. This guards against speculative appropriation of classical theism detached from the economy. He exposes how an untethered analogia entis can drift into confidence in a neutral metaphysical reason. He restates analogia fidei not as a hermeneutical slogan that Scripture interprets Scripture, but as a dogmatic claim that only faith, created by the Spirit, can correspond to God’s Word. Yet Barth’s account, in rejecting analogia entis tout court, struggles to acknowledge the creature’s ongoing relation to God in **creation** and **providence** that Scripture itself affirms. Romans 1 is not only a warning about idolatry but a claim about the perspicuous power and divinity of God in the things that have been made. Psalm 19 does not say the heavens once spoke but that they continually declare the glory of God. Barthian exegesis often reconstrues these affirmations into corollaries of revelation. The result is an ethical and soteriological recoding of ontology that risks denying that creatures as creatures bear a rational imprint of their Creator.

Herman Bavinck (1854–1921) offers a constructive path that repairs some of these tensions without surrendering a Reformed stance. In Reformed Dogmatics he advances an organic relation between **general revelation** and **special revelation**. God’s revelation is one, diversified in mode and scope, and both orders are from God’s triune will and wisdom. Bavinck fiercely protects **divine simplicity** and the **Creator-creature distinction**, and he insists that all creaturely names for God are analogical and accommodated. He draws on the Reformed scholastic distinction between **archetypal** and **ectypal** theology. Only God has archetypal theology, a perfect knowledge of himself. Creatures receive ectypal theology through revelation, which is true yet finite and ectypal. This reframes analogy not as an ascent by being but as a mode of reception under God’s self-communication. Nevertheless, Bavinck acknowledges that because creation is from the Word, it participates by design in a rational order that signifies God. The **sensus divinitatis** and the testimony of creation are real. The noetic effects of sin distort but do not erase this revelation. Grace restores and elevates nature without dissolving nature into grace. Bavinck is wary of an analogia entis untethered from Scripture and redemptive history, but he does not share Barth’s strict prohibition against **natural theology**. For Bavinck, natural theology is legitimate when normed by special revelation and repented of as autonomous confidence. Here, analogy becomes the grammar of an obedient science of God.

Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987) radicalizes the Reformed stance on analogy by pressing the antithesis between believer and unbeliever while intensifying the metaphysical groundwork for **analogical knowledge**. Van Til distinguishes univocal, equivocal, and analogical predication, arguing that only analogical predication is consistent with the **Creator-creature distinction**. On his account, all human knowledge is analogical because only God knows himself and all things exhaustively and originally. Human knowledge is derivative, covenantally situated, and dependent on revelation. This dependence does not reduce truth to fideism. Instead it honors **divine aseity** and **simplicity**. Van Til’s doctrine of the ontological Trinity supplies the philosophical depth. Human predication is coherent because reality is not composed of brute facts. Facts are what they are by the plan of the triune God. Hence Van Til can affirm with the Reformed orthodox that there is **general revelation** and that Romans 1 leaves all without excuse, yet he denies that there exists a neutral natural theology shared by believer and unbeliever. The unbeliever suppresses general revelation. The believer, by regeneration and Scripture, can reconstruct creaturely knowledge according to truth. Van Til’s critique of Thomism targets not Aquinas’s careful deployment of analogy but Protestant scholastic borrowings that, in his judgment, allowed nature to become too autonomous. His critique of Barth charges that Barth’s dialectical account collapses into historicism or equivocity, since revelation as sheer event deprives theology of stable divine propositions.

These five figures delineate the problem and open a constructive way through it. Analogia entis gives us a powerful metaphysical idiom for how creatures can signify God without collapsing into univocity. Yet its Catholic development often situated nature as a closed integrity, risking extrinsicism or an overconfident natural theology. Barth retrieved the primacy of revelation and anchored analogy in the obedience of faith. Yet he muted the created medium of revelation that Scripture celebrates. Bavinck and Van Til preserve the strengths of both while restructuring the ground. The Reformed scholastic archetypal-ectypal distinction safeguards the asymmetry of divine and human knowledge without sacrificing truth, and Van Til’s insistence on **analogical knowledge** as the only mode available to creatures drives theology to confess dependence on God’s self-revelation at every point. The result is not a refusal of analogy of being, but its conversion into an analogy of being under **covenant**, where being’s signifying capacity is itself an effect of the Word who creates and orders all things toward the glory of God in Christ.

Internal debates on both sides sharpen the contours. Within the Catholic tradition, the quarrel over nature and grace, exemplified in twentieth-century ressourcement, split those who defended a strict pure nature from those who insisted on an intrinsic openness of nature to the supernatural. Przywara’s own proposal cut across that division by depicting the creature’s inner tension as the stage for grace’s perfecting work. Yet his program left many Protestants unsure whether the resulting metaphysics could avoid ontological continuity that erodes **divine aseity**. Within the Reformed tradition, disputes over **natural theology** have at times pitted those seeking retrieval of Thomistic arguments for God’s existence against those, following Van Til, who reject the project of neutral proofs. Careful Reformed orthodox sources, however, show that both parties share commitments to **general revelation**, **accommodation**, and analogical predication. Turretin and Junius do not traffic in univocity. They construe theology as a science derived from God’s own knowledge communicated to us. The real question is whether post-Reformation Protestantism can reclaim what is sound in classical analogia entis while refusing any suggestion that being as such, apart from God’s self-interpretation, authorizes knowledge of God.

External debates also complicate the scene. Duns Scotus’s univocity of being sought to ground theology and metaphysics by ensuring that being is said in the same sense of God and creatures. This move, whether rightly attributed to Scotus or not, is widely judged to jeopardize transcendence by placing God and creatures under a common concept. Thomists and Reformed alike can object that univocity wrongly posits a meta-level that contains God. Modern critics like Heidegger charge that analogia entis is the essence of onto-theology and thus the root of Western metaphysics’ forgetfulness of Being. For Christian classical theists, this critique is overdrawn. Analogy was developed precisely to avoid treating God as a highest being among beings. The analytic turn in contemporary theology sometimes suggests that univocal core meanings are necessary to avoid equivocation. The Reformed reply points to the success of analogical accounts of predication that secure cross-contextual reference without univocity by grounding terms in God’s naming of himself and the intrinsic intentionality of creatures as created to signify God.

Contemporary debates revolve around retrieval and reconfiguration. Protestant interest in natural law and classical theism sometimes reopens Thomistic pathways, while the legacy of Barth warns against intellectual impatience that treats metaphysical clarity as enough for theology. Analytic theology has sharpened tools for discussing reference, metaphor, and properties, and can be recruited to articulate how analogical terms like good and wise apply to God. Yet the most crucial contemporary pressure is cultural rather than academic. Secular nominalism and expressive individualism erode confidence in rational order. A Reformed account of analogy must therefore teach candidates to say why the world’s intelligibility is not a brute given but the effect of God’s wise providence. **Analogical knowledge** is possible because the triune God makes the world to speak his praise and makes Scripture to speak his name.

The position I defend can now be summarized and defended against probable examiner challenges. First, we affirm that all true predication about God by creatures is analogical. The anchor is the **Creator-creature distinction**. God is simple, infinite, and a se, while creatures are composite, finite, and dependent. Univocity would domesticate God by placing him under creaturely concepts. Equivocity would make revelation unintelligible. Analogy is the only mode that honors both transcendence and knowledge. Second, we affirm **general revelation** and a chastened **natural theology**. Romans 1 obligates us to say that the created order witnesses to God’s eternal power and divine nature. But we deny that fallen reason, operating as allegedly neutral, can from that witness construct a salvific or even fully adequate theism. The noetic effects of sin and the antithesis between belief and unbelief bar that path. Natural theology, so far as it is legitimate, is a ministry of sanctified reason that, under **analogical knowledge** and **accommodation**, articulates what special revelation already authorizes. Third, we reject the analogia entis where it functions as an autonomous metaphysical ladder. The being of creatures analogically reflects God only because the triune God wills and orders creation to be a theater of his glory. There is no independent scale running up to God. Fourth, we affirm an analogia fidei in both senses relevant to this debate. As a hermeneutical rule, the proportion of faith directs Scripture to interpret Scripture, so dogma is normed by revelation. As a dogmatic principle, the Holy Spirit establishes the correspondence between God’s Word and our believing response. This does not eliminate created media or creaturely reasoning, but it governs them.

Examiners will press whether this Reformed position collapses into Barthianism when it insists that knowledge is by faith. The answer is no. We maintain that **general revelation** is revelation, not just a cipher decoded by special revelation. The created order is already speech from God. What special revelation gives is the redemptive context and corrective lens by which that speech is heard rightly. We also differ from Barth in asserting that revelation includes divinely authorized propositions about God. While Barth worries about propositionalism, the Reformed insist that confessional judgments are warranted by God’s own communicative action, and that **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **immutability** are not speculative theses but exegetical deliverances rendered in analogical terms.

Another likely objection concerns whether Van Til’s insistence that all knowledge is analogical reduces theological language to mere similitudes. The response recurs to the **archetypal-ectypal** distinction. Our knowledge is not approximate in the sense of probably true but inaccurate. It is true as ectypal knowledge, because God himself grants and norms it. The analogy is between God’s perfect knowledge and our finite knowledge, not between truth and probability. Furthermore, the biblical doctrine of **accommodation** assures that divine speech takes forms we can grasp without ceasing to be divine in origin and authority.

A different examiner might press whether affirming any analogy of being concedes to the Catholic schema. We answer that the Reformed do recognize an analogy of being in a derivative sense. Creation is from the triune God through the Word. The being of creatures, in its very order and directedness, is already a sign of God. But while this yields an analogy of being, it is not an independent metaphysical pathway. It is a theological reading of being as effect and sign of God’s action. It is therefore an analogia entis under **covenant**, not over it.

Finally, a question about Scotist univocity. Must we not have some univocity if our terms are to refer at all. The Reformed answer agrees that terms like existence and goodness have conceptual continuity across uses. But they do not name a genus under which God falls. Their continuity is secured by God’s authorship of minds and meanings and by the intrinsic purposiveness of creation to signify God. That is, the epistemic bridge is not a shared genus but God’s own ensuring that his self-naming can reach creatures through created signs.

This Reformed position preserves the best in both Aquinas and Barth while correcting their excesses in deployment. From Aquinas we receive the metaphysics of participation, the discipline of **analogical predication**, and the habit of refusing univocity. From Barth we receive the priority of grace, the Christological concentration of knowledge of God, and the insistence that theology answers to God’s free self-revelation. From Bavinck and Van Til we receive the covenantal ordering of knowing, a cleansed **natural theology**, a deepened doctrine of **general revelation**, and a principled account of why all creaturely knowledge is analogical without being uncertain. This posture produces a dogmatics that is neither allergic to metaphysics nor captive to it, one that speaks of God with reverence because it speaks as God’s covenant-partner, in words God has first spoken.

The broader implications for adjacent loci are clear. In **Trinity**, analogical predication grounds the confession that the names Father, Son, and Spirit truly name God as he is, though they do not grant comprehension. In **Christology**, the hypostatic union demands exact predication rules such that what is said of the person is said truly, analogically, across natures, without confusion. In **soteriology**, justification and adoption presuppose that God’s righteousness and our righteousness are neither univocal nor equivocal, yet through union with Christ there is a real participation that is covenantal rather than ontological. In **ecclesiology**, the church’s confession is analogically true as it echoes God’s Word, a derivative authority that forbids sovereignty over Scripture but also forbids skepticism about creed. And in **ethics**, analogia entis under covenant explodes both moralism and antinomianism. The created order is a repository of common grace and common signs, yet only in the **covenant** of grace is the creature restored to read them aright.

To prepare for oral defense, one must be ready to answer succinctly. Analogia entis, rightly valued as a bulwark against univocity, cannot be adopted as an independent road to God. Analogia fidei, rightly feared as fideistic if severed from creation, must be affirmed as the decisive principle because God’s self-revelation is the ground and measure of all our talk about him. The negotiation is not a compromise but a reorientation: analogy is not a way up but a way down, the mode in which God communicates himself to us, and in which the world he made testifies to him. Under the light of **divine simplicity**, we speak many names that name one God, as he has named himself. Under the gravity of the **Creator-creature distinction**, we never forget that all our knowledge of God is creaturely and thus analogical, but true and saving because it rests on God’s own truthfulness. That is the path through the old controversy that prepares a candidate to defend the confession with clarity, humility, and courage.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Analogia entis is an analogy of being that grounds theological predication in creaturely participation in God, while analogia fidei grounds the correspondence of human knowledge to God in God’s self-revelation and the obedience of faith; both aim to secure true yet non-univocal knowledge under **divine simplicity** and the **Creator-creature distinction**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Thomas Aquinas: analogical predication via participation, enabling a disciplined **natural theology**.
  - Erich Przywara: modern synthesis of analogia entis as similarity-in-greater-dissimilarity, nature-grace in dynamic tension.
  - Karl Barth: rejection of analogia entis, affirmation of analogia fidei as Spirit-wrought correspondence to revelation, Christocentric method.
  - Herman Bavinck: organic relation of **general revelation** and **special revelation**, **archetypal-ectypal** frame, analogical language by **accommodation**.
  - Cornelius Van Til: all knowledge is **analogical**, antithesis and noetic effects of sin, chastened **natural theology** under **covenant**.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Catholic nature-grace and modes of analogy; Reformed disputes on the scope of **natural theology** and relation to Thomism; Protestant confusion between hermeneutical and Barthian senses of analogia fidei.
  - External: Scotist univocity, Heideggerian critique of onto-theology, analytic demands for univocal core meanings.
  - Contemporary: Retrievals of **classical theism**, analytic accounts of analogical predication, Protestant natural law, enduring Barth–Thomist standoff.
- Defended position: A Reformed posture that affirms robust analogical predication and a real analogy of being only as grounded in **creation**, **providence**, and **covenant**, rejects analogia entis as an autonomous metaphysical ladder, and upholds analogia fidei as the governing principle by which **general revelation** and **special revelation** together yield obedient, true **analogical knowledge** of God.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does rejecting analogia entis deny Romans 1? No; we affirm **general revelation** and a chastened **natural theology** normed by Scripture.
  - Is Van Til’s analogical knowledge equivocation? No; it yields true ectypal knowledge grounded in God’s self-naming and **accommodation**.
  - Does Barth eliminate creation’s witness? He safeguards revelation but underplays ongoing created signification; we affirm both.
  - Is some univocity required for reference? No genus is shared; reference holds by God’s authorship of minds and meanings and created signification.
  - How do simplicity and analogy cohere? Many predicates name the one simple God analogically, each indicating God as he is without implying composition.
