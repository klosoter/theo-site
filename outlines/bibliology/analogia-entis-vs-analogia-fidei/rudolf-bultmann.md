# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann rejected the **analogia entis** as a viable means of knowing God, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei**, where knowledge of God is grounded in **revelation** and received by **faith**. For Bultmann, human concepts and natural reason are insufficient for apprehending the divine; only through the **kerygma** and existential encounter with the **Word of God** can true knowledge of God be attained.

- "God is not an object in the world, nor can he be grasped by human thought or language." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)
- Existence and Faith (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the analogia entis**
    - Denies that there is a natural analogy between God and creation accessible through human reason.
    - Argues that all human language about God is fundamentally inadequate apart from revelation.
    - Sees the analogia entis as leading to objectification and domestication of God.
    - Maintains that God is wholly other and cannot be reached by metaphysical speculation.
    - "There is no direct knowledge of God apart from his self-revelation." (Faith and Understanding)

2. **Primacy of the analogia fidei**
    - Asserts that knowledge of God comes only through faith in response to revelation.
    - Emphasizes the centrality of the biblical witness and the proclamation (kerygma).
    - Faith is an existential response, not a rational deduction from nature.
    - The analogia fidei preserves the transcendence and freedom of God in revelation.
    - "Faith is the only possible attitude toward God, for God is not an object but the ground of existence." (Existence and Faith)

3. **Demythologization and existential interpretation**
    - Proposes that the biblical message must be interpreted existentially, not mythologically.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind biblical language.
    - The analogia fidei is maintained by focusing on the encounter with the Word, not metaphysical analogies.
    - Human existence is transformed by the kerygma, not by speculative theology.
    - "What matters is not the mythological world picture but the existential decision demanded by the kerygma." (New Testament and Mythology)

4. **Critique of natural theology**
    - Rejects any theology that claims knowledge of God apart from revelation in Christ.
    - Sees natural theology as a product of human pride and autonomy.
    - Argues that natural theology undermines the radical nature of faith.
    - Maintains that God is revealed only in the event of faith, not in the structures of creation.
    - "The question of God is not a theoretical question but one of existence." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Centrality of the kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is the locus of God's self-revelation.
    - The kerygma confronts individuals with the demand for existential decision.
    - Knowledge of God is inseparable from the event of proclamation and response in faith.
    - The analogia fidei is actualized in the encounter with the preached Word.
    - "The Word of God is not a doctrine but an event that addresses me here and now." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s rejection of the **analogia entis** and his emphasis on the **analogia fidei** profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology, especially in the realms of **biblical hermeneutics** and existential interpretation. His approach influenced the trajectory of **demythologization** and the understanding of revelation as event rather than doctrine. While controversial, his insistence on the radical otherness of God and the necessity of faith in response to revelation continues to provoke theological reflection and debate.
