# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann critically engages the debate between **analogia entis** and **analogia fidei**, siding with a **revelation-centered** approach that prioritizes God's self-disclosure in Christ over metaphysical speculation. He rejects the possibility of a natural analogy between God and humanity apart from **revelation**, emphasizing the **Christological** and **eschatological** dimensions of theological knowledge. For Moltmann, true knowledge of God is grounded in the event of **reconciliation** and the **history of Jesus Christ**.

- "The knowledge of God is possible only through God’s own self-revelation in the history of Jesus Christ." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- God in Creation (1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation over Natural Theology**
    - Rejects **analogia entis** as insufficient for true knowledge of God.
    - Asserts that God can only be known through **self-revelation** in Christ.
    - Critiques attempts to ground theology in metaphysical or ontological analogies.
    - Emphasizes the discontinuity between Creator and creation apart from revelation.
    - "There is no path from man to God that does not lead through the history of Christ." (The Crucified God)

2. **Primacy of the Analogia Fidei**
    - Affirms that faith, not being, is the proper analogy for theological knowledge.
    - The **analogia fidei** is rooted in the event of Christ and the witness of **Scripture**.
    - Human knowledge of God is always a response to divine initiative.
    - The church’s confession is the locus of analogical knowledge of God.
    - "Faith is the participation in the history of Christ, not the extension of human possibilities." (Theology of Hope)

3. **Christological Mediation**
    - Christ is the exclusive mediator of knowledge between God and humanity.
    - All analogical language about God must be tested by the cross and resurrection.
    - The **crucified God** reveals divine solidarity with human suffering.
    - **Christology** corrects and limits speculative analogies.
    - "The cross is the contradiction of all religious and metaphysical analogies." (The Crucified God)

4. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - Knowledge of God is oriented toward the future promised in Christ.
    - The **analogia fidei** is dynamic, shaped by hope in God’s coming kingdom.
    - **Eschatology** relativizes all present analogies and concepts.
    - The future of God’s revelation breaks open static metaphysical systems.
    - "Christian theology is eschatological, or it is not Christian at all." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Trinitarian Relationality**
    - The **Trinity** is the ground and goal of all analogical knowledge.
    - Human relationships reflect, but do not replicate, the relationality of the triune God.
    - The analogia relationis is preferred over analogia entis.
    - The Trinity’s openness invites participation, not metaphysical speculation.
    - "The Trinity is not a metaphysical speculation but the expression of God’s openness to the world." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s rejection of the **analogia entis** and his robust articulation of the **analogia fidei** have significantly shaped modern Protestant theology, especially in the realms of **Christology** and **eschatology**. His work has influenced debates on the nature of **revelation** and the limits of natural theology, challenging theologians to ground their knowledge of God in the event of Christ rather than in abstract metaphysics. Moltmann’s emphasis on the **Trinity** and relationality continues to inspire constructive theological reflection and ecumenical dialogue.
