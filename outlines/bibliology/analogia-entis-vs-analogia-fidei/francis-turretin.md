# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin firmly rejected the **analogia entis** (analogy of being) as a foundation for theology, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith) as the proper means by which finite creatures know the infinite God. For Turretin, **revelation** and **Scripture** provide the only reliable access to divine truth, and human knowledge of God is always analogical, grounded in what God has revealed rather than in metaphysical similarity between Creator and creature.

- "Between God and the creature no similarity can be expressed without implying a greater dissimilarity." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Catechism for the Churches of Geneva
- Selected Theological Questions (various disputations)
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the Analogia Entis**
    - Denies that there is a metaphysical continuity or shared "being" between God and creatures.
    - Argues that any attempt to know God through the analogy of being undermines divine transcendence.
    - Sees the analogia entis as a root of Roman Catholic natural theology, which he opposes.
    - Maintains that only revelation, not ontology, bridges the gap between Creator and creature.
    - "We deny that there is any analogy of being between God and creatures, but only of names and attributes." (Institutes)

2. **Primacy of the Analogia Fidei**
    - Asserts that knowledge of God comes through the analogy of faith, grounded in Scripture.
    - Emphasizes the unity and coherence of biblical revelation as the interpretive key.
    - Holds that Scripture interprets Scripture, forming the basis for all theological reasoning.
    - Insists that faith, not reason or metaphysics, is the proper starting point for theology.
    - "The analogy of faith is the rule of interpreting Scripture by Scripture." (Institutes)

3. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - Stresses the infinite qualitative difference between God and all created things.
    - Maintains that God's essence is incomprehensible to finite minds.
    - Argues that all human language about God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - Upholds divine aseity and independence as foundational to theology.
    - "God is known by us, not as he is in himself, but as he has revealed himself." (Institutes)

4. **Necessity of Revelation**
    - Affirms that true knowledge of God depends entirely on divine self-disclosure.
    - Rejects autonomous reason as a source for theological knowledge.
    - Sees general revelation as insufficient for saving knowledge of God.
    - Places special revelation (Scripture) at the center of theological method.
    - "Revelation is the foundation of all our knowledge of God." (Institutes)

5. **Anti-Scholastic and Anti-Roman Polemic**
    - Critiques Roman Catholic theology for relying on philosophical categories foreign to Scripture.
    - Opposes the use of Aristotelian metaphysics as a basis for understanding God.
    - Warns that analogia entis leads to idolatry by domesticating the divine mystery.
    - Advocates a Reformed scholasticism rooted in biblical exegesis, not speculative reason.
    - "We must beware lest, by philosophizing too boldly, we lose the simplicity of the faith." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous defense of the **analogia fidei** shaped the trajectory of Reformed orthodoxy, reinforcing the centrality of **revelation** and the **Creator-creature distinction** in Protestant theology. His polemics against the analogia entis influenced later Reformed theologians, including Bavinck and Van Til, in their critiques of natural theology. Turretin’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the limits of human knowledge of God and the necessity of Scripture as the norm for all theological reflection.
