# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg critically engaged the debate between **analogia entis** (analogy of being) and **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith), ultimately favoring a dynamic, historical approach to **revelation** that transcends both classical models. He argued that **God’s self-disclosure** occurs in history and is accessible through rational inquiry, challenging the strict separation between **natural theology** and **revelation**. Pannenberg’s theology seeks to integrate **reason** and **faith** without collapsing one into the other.

- "The knowledge of God is possible only because God himself makes himself knowable in the openness of history." (Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vols. 1–3 (1988–1993)
- Basic Questions in Theology (1970)
- Theology and the Philosophy of Science (1976)
- Jesus—God and Man (1968)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Historical Event**
    - Revelation is not a static deposit but unfolds in the course of universal history.
    - God’s self-disclosure is accessible to all, not limited to the church or a special community.
    - The meaning of revelation is open to rational investigation and public verification.
    - This approach challenges both the analogia entis and analogia fidei by rooting knowledge of God in historical reality.
    - "Revelation is not a private event but a public, historical occurrence." (Revelation as History)

2. **Critique of Analogia Entis**
    - Pannenberg rejects the idea that human reason can ascend to God through analogy of being alone.
    - He sees analogia entis as insufficient for grasping the dynamic, historical character of God’s revelation.
    - The analogy of being risks making God an object within the world’s ontological structure.
    - True knowledge of God depends on God’s initiative in history, not on metaphysical similarity.
    - "The analogia entis cannot bridge the gulf between God and man apart from revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Revision of Analogia Fidei**
    - Pannenberg critiques Barth’s analogia fidei for isolating revelation from universal history and reason.
    - He insists that faith must be open to rational scrutiny and historical evidence.
    - Revelation is not a closed circle of faith but invites universal participation and verification.
    - The analogia fidei must be reinterpreted in light of God’s self-revelation in history.
    - "Faith must not withdraw from the claims of reason and history." (Basic Questions in Theology)

4. **Integration of Reason and Faith**
    - Pannenberg advocates for a theology that is both rationally coherent and faithful to revelation.
    - He opposes fideism and rationalism, seeking a critical correlation between faith and reason.
    - Theological claims must be open to public argument and historical investigation.
    - This integration challenges the dichotomy often assumed between analogia entis and analogia fidei.
    - "Theology must be prepared to expose its truth claims to the judgment of reason." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

5. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - Full knowledge of God is only possible in the eschatological consummation of history.
    - Present knowledge is provisional, awaiting final clarification at the end of history.
    - The openness of history allows for ongoing revelation and understanding.
    - This eschatological perspective relativizes both analogia entis and analogia fidei as incomplete.
    - "Only at the end will the truth of God’s revelation be fully manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to **revelation** and the analogy debate has significantly influenced modern theology, especially in discussions of **public theology** and the relationship between faith and reason. By insisting on the historical and rational accessibility of God’s self-disclosure, he offered a mediating position that challenged both neo-scholastic and Barthian paradigms. His work continues to shape conversations about the **nature of theological knowledge** and the possibility of a universal, historically grounded theology.
