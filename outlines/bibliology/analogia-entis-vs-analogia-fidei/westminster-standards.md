# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards decisively reject the **analogia entis** (analogy of being) as a foundation for knowing God, instead grounding all true knowledge of God in the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith). They emphasize that God is known only through his **self-revelation** in **Scripture**, and that human reason, unaided by revelation, cannot attain true knowledge of the divine. This stance upholds the **Creator-creature distinction** and the necessity of **special revelation** for theological understanding.

- "The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God's part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of covenant." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 1, 2, and 7)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 1–7)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 1–4)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on the reading and preaching of Scripture)
- John Murray, "The Theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is by Divine Initiative**
    - God is utterly transcendent and unknowable apart from his own act of **self-revelation**.
    - Human knowledge of God depends entirely on God's voluntary **condescension**.
    - The **analogia entis** is rejected as insufficient for true knowledge of God.
    - All saving knowledge is mediated through **special revelation**.
    - "Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God, and of his will, which is necessary unto salvation." (WCF 1.1)

2. **Scripture as the Only Infallible Rule**
    - The **Holy Scriptures** are the supreme and only infallible standard for faith and life.
    - All doctrines must be derived from and tested by the **analogia fidei**—the analogy of faith within Scripture.
    - Human reason and tradition are subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are emphasized for all matters of salvation.
    - "The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture." (WCF 1.6)

3. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - There is an infinite qualitative distinction between God and all creatures.
    - God’s being and attributes are not accessible through any shared ontological ground with creation.
    - The **analogia entis** is seen as compromising the uniqueness and sovereignty of God.
    - True knowledge of God is always analogical, not univocal or equivocal, and grounded in revelation.
    - "There is but one only, living, and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions." (WCF 2.1)

4. **Faith as the Means of Knowledge**
    - Knowledge of God is appropriated through **faith**, not autonomous reason.
    - The **analogia fidei** refers to interpreting Scripture in light of Scripture, maintaining doctrinal coherence.
    - Faith is a gift of God, produced by the Holy Spirit through the Word.
    - The act of faith rests on the authority of God speaking in Scripture.
    - "By this faith, a Christian believeth to be true whatsoever is revealed in the Word, for the authority of God himself speaking therein." (WLC Q.72)

5. **Covenant as the Framework of Revelation**
    - God’s knowledge is communicated to humanity through the **covenant of grace**.
    - The covenant structure underscores God’s initiative and the necessity of revelation.
    - The **analogia fidei** is preserved within the unfolding of redemptive history.
    - The covenant relationship is the context for understanding God’s self-disclosure.
    - "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works... Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace." (WCF 7.2–3)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** by rejecting the **analogia entis** and insisting on the **analogia fidei** as the only proper basis for knowing God. Their emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the sufficiency of **Scripture** has influenced generations of confessional Reformed churches and theologians. This legacy continues to inform contemporary debates over natural theology, revelation, and the limits of human reason in theology.
