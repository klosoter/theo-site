# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a staunch advocate of the **analogia fidei** over the **analogia entis**, emphasizing the primacy of **revelation** and the necessity of **Scripture** as the only proper ground for theological knowledge. He critiques the **analogia entis** as undermining the **Creator-creature distinction** and insists that all true knowledge of God is mediated through **Christ** and interpreted by faith.

- "The analogia entis, as a theological principle, is fundamentally at odds with the Reformation’s insistence on the sufficiency and finality of revelation in Christ and Scripture." (God’s Word in Servant-Form, p. 125)

## Key Works

- God’s Word in Servant-Form: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck on the Doctrine of Scripture
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology" in New Dictionary of Biblical Theology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology" in Westminster Theological Journal

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Redemptive-Historical**
   - God’s self-disclosure is always tied to his redemptive acts in history.
   - The **analogia fidei** arises from the pattern of revelation culminating in Christ.
   - There is no neutral or natural knowledge of God apart from revelation.
   - The **analogia entis** is rejected as it posits a continuity between God and creation apart from redemptive revelation.
   - "Revelation is always redemptive in character, never a mere extension of creation." (God’s Word in Servant-Form, p. 110)

2. **Scripture as the Norming Norm**
   - Scripture is the only infallible rule for faith and life.
   - The **analogia fidei** is grounded in the self-attesting authority of Scripture.
   - The **analogia entis** is seen as an extra-biblical principle that competes with sola Scriptura.
   - All theological reasoning must be subordinate to the biblical witness.
   - "The analogia fidei is nothing other than the confession that Scripture alone is the norm of all theology." (God’s Word in Servant-Form, p. 128)

3. **Christocentric Epistemology**
   - True knowledge of God is possible only through union with Christ.
   - The **analogia fidei** is inseparable from a Christ-centered approach to theology.
   - The **analogia entis** is critiqued for bypassing the necessity of Christ as mediator.
   - Faith, not natural reason, is the means by which God is known.
   - "All knowledge of God is mediated through Christ and appropriated by faith." (By Faith, Not by Sight, p. 37)

4. **Creator-Creature Distinction Maintained**
   - The ontological gap between God and humanity is absolute.
   - The **analogia entis** blurs this distinction by positing a metaphysical similarity.
   - The **analogia fidei** preserves the distinction by rooting knowledge in revelation, not nature.
   - Human knowledge is always analogical, never univocal or equivocal.
   - "The Creator-creature distinction is not overcome by analogy but maintained by revelation." (God’s Word in Servant-Form, p. 132)

5. **Reformed Confessionalism**
   - Gaffin aligns with the Reformed tradition’s rejection of the **analogia entis**.
   - The **Westminster Standards** reflect the **analogia fidei** as a hermeneutical principle.
   - Confessional theology is always subordinate to Scripture, not philosophical speculation.
   - The Reformed tradition’s emphasis on faith alone (sola fide) shapes its approach to analogy.
   - "The Reformed confessions are clear: theology proceeds by faith, not by an analogy of being." (God’s Word in Servant-Form, p. 129)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust defense of the **analogia fidei** has reinforced the Reformed commitment to **sola Scriptura** and the centrality of **redemptive-historical revelation**. His work has shaped generations of Westminster theologians in their approach to the relationship between **nature and grace**. By critiquing the **analogia entis**, Gaffin has helped clarify the distinctives of Reformed epistemology and hermeneutics, ensuring that the Creator-creature distinction remains foundational in contemporary theology.
