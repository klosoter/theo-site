# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame firmly rejects the **analogia entis** as a foundation for theological knowledge, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei** as the proper mode of theological reasoning. He grounds knowledge of God in **revelation**, emphasizing the necessity of **Scripture** and the **Creator-creature distinction** while maintaining that all human knowledge is analogical, dependent on God’s self-disclosure.

- "The analogia entis is not only unnecessary but also unbiblical; our knowledge of God is possible only because God has revealed himself to us." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought (1995)
- Apologetics to the Glory of God (1994)
- A History of Western Philosophy and Theology (2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Foundation of Knowledge**
    - All true knowledge of God depends on his **self-revelation** in Scripture.
    - Human reason is insufficient apart from God’s initiative in revealing himself.
    - The **analogia fidei** prioritizes the interpretive authority of the Bible.
    - Revelation is both propositional and personal, involving God’s covenantal presence.
    - "We know God only because he has chosen to reveal himself to us." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

2. **Rejection of the Analogia Entis**
    - The **analogia entis** is seen as a Roman Catholic error that undermines the Creator-creature distinction.
    - Frame argues it leads to autonomous human reasoning apart from revelation.
    - He maintains that analogical knowledge is possible only through God’s self-communication.
    - The analogia entis risks making God accessible through natural theology rather than redemptive revelation.
    - "The analogia entis is not a biblical doctrine, but a philosophical construction foreign to Scripture." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Primacy of the Analogia Fidei**
    - The **analogia fidei** insists that all theological statements must be governed by Scripture.
    - Human language about God is analogical, shaped by the pattern of biblical revelation.
    - The analogy of faith guards against speculative theology.
    - This approach is rooted in the Reformation’s commitment to **sola Scriptura**.
    - "The analogy of faith means that Scripture interprets Scripture, and all our theology must be subject to its authority." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

4. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God is ontologically distinct from creation; there is no shared being between God and humans.
    - Knowledge of God is always analogical, never univocal or equivocal.
    - The distinction safeguards God’s transcendence and sovereignty.
    - Any attempt to bridge the gap apart from revelation is idolatrous.
    - "We must always remember that God is the Creator and we are his creatures; our knowledge is dependent and derivative." (Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought)

5. **Covenantal Epistemology**
    - Knowledge is personal, ethical, and covenantal, not merely abstract or neutral.
    - The knower is always in a covenant relationship with God, either in obedience or rebellion.
    - Epistemology is inseparable from theology and ethics.
    - The **analogia fidei** is rooted in the covenantal context of revelation.
    - "All human knowledge is covenantal: it is either obedient or disobedient to God’s revelation." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s robust defense of the **analogia fidei** has shaped contemporary Reformed epistemology, reinforcing the centrality of **Scripture** and the **Creator-creature distinction** in theological method. His critique of the analogia entis has influenced generations of students and scholars, particularly within the Van Tilian tradition. Frame’s work continues to serve as a touchstone for those seeking a consistently biblical approach to the knowledge of God.
