### ESSAY
The dispute between **analogia entis** and **analogia fidei** focuses the most basic question in theology: how can human beings speak truly of the God who is infinite, simple, and absolutely distinct from creatures. On one side, the **analogia entis**, the analogy of being, claims that because creatures receive their being from God, there is an ordered resemblance between Creator and creature that grounds meaningful predication about God. On the other, the **analogia fidei**, the analogy of faith, insists that our knowledge of God is grounded not in a general metaphysical structure of being but in God’s self‑revelation received by faith. At Westminster, examiners will test whether you can show that this is not a mere slogan battle, but an argument about **ontology**, **epistemology**, **prolegomena**, and the very conditions of **theological language**, and whether you can locate Aquinas, Barth, Przywara, Bavinck, and Van Til with precision inside that argument.

At the conceptual level, the issue emerges from a set of tensions. First, the Creator–creature distinction as articulated in **classical theism**: God is not the highest instance within a genus but pure act, whose **essence and existence are identical**, possessing **incommunicable attributes** such as **aseity**, **simplicity**, and **immutability**. If God is thus ontologically unique, human concepts, which arise from creatures, seem unfit for God. If this thought is radicalized, we reach equivocity: language about God says nothing truly about him. Second, Scripture clearly speaks of God using creaturely predicates, some clearly analogical. God is wise, just, and good, yet his wisdom is unsearchable, his justice unjudgeable, his goodness transcendent. Third, fallen human beings know God both as created image‑bearers and as sinners whose minds are darkened. Any Christian account of **analogy** must honor the reality of **general revelation** and **natural knowledge of God**, the noetic effects of sin, and the necessity and sufficiency of **special revelation**.

Thomas Aquinas is the key architect of the classical **analogia entis**. Formed by Aristotelian metaphysics and the earlier Augustinian and Dionysian traditions of participation, Aquinas articulates a structured account of how language can meaningfully ascend from creatures to God without collapsing him into creation. In the Summa Theologiae, he insists that words applied to God and creatures are neither purely univocal nor purely equivocal but analogical. Univocal language would place God and creature under a common genus and destroy the Creator–creature distinction; equivocal language would render revelation meaningless. The key is the doctrine of **participation**: creatures have being, goodness, and wisdom by receiving them from God who is being itself, goodness itself, wisdom itself. Because created perfections are real, though finite, participations in the divine perfections, we can truly, though imperfectly, predicate these names of God.

This is not a merely semantic move but a metaphysical one. The **analogia entis** presupposes a robust account of **causality** and **participation**, especially as summarized in the fourth way: we observe degrees of being and goodness in creatures and infer a maximal cause, God. The order of being grounds the order of knowing. Yet Aquinas does not claim that natural reason possesses comprehensive or salvific knowledge. He acknowledges that what reason can learn of God is confused and mixed with error owing to sin, so that grace and revelation are needed. Still, natural theology, operating by **analogy of proportionality** and **analogy of attribution**, yields true propositional knowledge about God.

Internal questions will press you here: does Aquinas’s account, in practice, risk sliding toward univocity when he uses the same terms across the Creator–creature divide. The Thomist answer is that the mode of signification and the reality signified differ. When we say “God is wise,” the term “wise” signifies wisdom in a mode taken from creatures, but it refers analogically to the simple, undivided being of God, where wisdom is identical with essence. God is not within a genus, but our language, derived from creatures, is rightly applied to him because he is the cause and archetype of the perfections we name.

Karl Barth’s mature theology defines itself over against this Thomistic and neo‑scholastic tradition at a decisive point: in his view, the **analogia entis** is the fundamental theological error. Famously, in his exchange with the Catholic philosopher Erich Przywara, Barth declared the **analogia entis** to be “the invention of Antichrist,” because it allegedly posits a point of continuity between God and creature apart from and prior to Jesus Christ. For Barth, the only legitimate **analogy** between God and humanity is the **analogia fidei**, the analogy of faith: a correspondence created by God’s self‑revelation in Christ and in the Spirit’s act of faith. Theology, he insists from the Romans commentary forward and especially in Church Dogmatics I.1, must begin not from a general notion of being or causality but from God’s concrete self‑speech in Christ witnessed in Scripture. Any attempt to infer God from an ordered structure of created being is, for Barth, a capitulation to natural religion.

Barth’s rejection is not a bare fideism. It rests on three deeper convictions. First, divine freedom: God is free in his self‑revelation and cannot be systematized within a metaphysical framework that precedes his Word. Second, the radicality of sin: Romans 1 does not authorize a constructive natural theology, but rather exposes and judges the idolatrous misuse of revelation by sinners. Third, the Christological concentration of all revelation: God is known only “in the face of Jesus Christ.” Any “God of the philosophers” is, at best, an abstraction, and at worst, a rival idol. The **analogia fidei**, as Barth defines it, is an event in which the Holy Spirit conforms human concepts and language to God’s self‑interpretation; there is no static structural analogy of being, only a dynamic, revelational analogy of relation.

Examiners will press you: does Barth thereby deny all natural knowledge of God and contradict the catholic and Reformed affirmation of general revelation. Barth occasionally speaks of a “secular parable” of revelation, and in Church Dogmatics II.1 he gives a complex account of the knowledge of God that humans possess as covenant partners, even in their rebellion. Yet he rigorously rejects any independent natural theology that could be developed apart from faith. Romans 1 reveals only that humanity already stands under the accusation of having distorted the knowledge of God. Barth fears that any appeal to **analogia entis** will function as a Trojan horse for a natural knowledge that does not pass under the judgment of Christ and Scripture.

Erich Przywara, Barth’s Roman Catholic interlocutor, offers the most sophisticated twentieth‑century retrieval of the **analogia entis** and thereby reshapes the debate. In his Analogia Entis and later essays, Przywara deepens the Thomistic doctrine of participation into what he calls a “unity‑in‑tension” between the ever‑greater God and finite creatures. His famous formula is the “ever greater dissimilarity within every similarity.” Drawing on the Fourth Lateran Council’s statement that no similarity between Creator and creature is so great that an even greater dissimilarity cannot be found, Przywara portrays analogy not as a static scale of being, but as a rhythmic movement of transcendence and immanence. The **analogia entis** is the basic structure of creatureliness: to be a creature is to exist in an essential, never overcomeable tension of dependence upon, and difference from, God.

Przywara’s development addresses a key objection: that classical analogy shrinks God to fit our categories. His solution is to show that the very structure of **analogy** safeguards divine incomprehensibility. Every true affirmation of similarity implies a deeper, asymmetrical difference. Yet he insists that this structure is itself the fruit of God’s creative act; it is not an autonomous ladder of ascent. Grace, in his Catholic account, builds on nature; the order of being is ordered from within to the order of grace. Here he demarcates his position from Barth: the **analogia entis** is not an independent bridge to God, but the ontological presupposition that makes the **analogia fidei** possible, as the historical realization of grace within creation. Recent Catholic and Protestant scholars have appealed to Przywara to argue that Barth’s dismissal of the **analogia entis** overdraws the dichotomy and that a properly Christological **analogia entis** is compatible with a strong doctrine of revelation.

At this point, a Reformed student at Westminster must articulate a position that is neither simply Thomist nor simply Barthian. Herman Bavinck is crucial here as a mediator. In his Reformed Dogmatics, Bavinck repeatedly emphasizes that all our knowledge of God is **ectypal** rather than **archetypal**: God alone has archetypal knowledge of himself, perfect, immediate, and comprehensive; creatures can only have a finite replica of that knowledge in accordance with their created capacity. This distinction already implies analogy: there is a real correspondence between God’s knowledge and ours, and between God’s being and our concepts of it, yet marked by qualitative difference. For Bavinck, the image of God in humanity, the **covenantal relation** of Creator to creation, and the universality of **general revelation** together form the basis of **analogical knowledge**.

Bavinck explicitly rejects both univocity and equivocity. He affirms with the catholic tradition that predicates such as “true,” “good,” and “just” are said analogically of God and creatures because they refer to perfections that have their fullness in God and are reflected in creatures. Yet he is wary of any speculative **natural theology** detached from Scripture. In his hands, the **analogia entis** is not a ladder by which autonomous reason climbs to God, but the created backdrop against which the **analogia fidei** unfolds. Scripture, as the principium cognoscendi, normatively interprets general revelation and gives us a **Christological** and **Trinitarian** specification of the God whose eternal power and divine nature are already manifested in creation.

Cornelius Van Til radicalizes and systematizes this Bavinckian instinct into a presuppositional Reformed critique of both classical Thomism and Barthian dialectical theology. For Van Til, the central axiom is the **absolute Creator–creature distinction** combined with a robust doctrine of **covenant** and **revelation**: God is the self‑contained ontological Trinity, and all facts are what they are by virtue of his plan. Human knowledge is **analogical** because it is always reinterpretive of God’s original self‑knowledge. Van Til uses the language of **analogical thinking** not in Aquinas’s technical sense but to insist that our knowledge is genuinely true yet never exhaustive and always dependent. There is no neutral territory; all reasoning presupposes either submission to or rebellion against divine revelation.

Van Til thus opposes the **analogia entis** as he understands it in Roman Catholic natural theology, because he judges that it posits a continuity of being and a degree of rational autonomy. At the same time, he criticizes Barth for an “analogical” concept of revelation that, in his reading, dissolves the concrete self‑identical truth of God into dialectical event, undermining propositional revelation and the reliability of Scripture. Van Til defends a strong **analogia fidei** in the Pauline sense, where Scripture interprets Scripture, yet insists that this hermeneutical rule is grounded in God’s comprehensive self‑knowledge and sovereign control of history. For him, Romans 1 demonstrates not merely the culpable misuse of revelation, but also the inescapable clarity of God’s general revelation: unbelievers know God and suppress the truth. This yields a Reformed version of natural theology, though never independent from Scripture.

Internal Reformed debates will surface here. Some Kuyperians and Van Tillians have rejected almost all talk of **natural theology**, while others, following Bavinck and more recently some analytic Reformed theologians, argue for a chastened, subordinate natural theology that is obedient to Scripture and aware of sin’s noetic effects. The crucial issue for an examiner is whether you can affirm that creation itself, as a revelatory medium, establishes a genuine analogical relation of being and meaning between God and creatures, without attributing autonomous authority to unaided reason. If you deny any ontological basis for analogy in creation, you slide toward Barth’s suspicion of metaphysics and risk undermining the objectivity of general revelation. If you affirm a robust **analogia entis** detached from **covenant** and **Word**, you risk granting nature a self‑standing revelatory sufficiency.

This brings us to the external debate between classical Thomism and Barth. The Thomist insists that without some **analogia entis**, Barth cannot explain how Scripture’s words latch onto God. Even the Christ whom Barth champions is a finite creature in his humanity, so any predication about the divine nature, even Christologically grounded, presupposes some ordered resemblance between the creature and the Creator. Moreover, Thomists argue, Romans 1 and Acts 17 portray not merely the guilt of idolaters, but the intelligibility of God’s eternal power and deity from the things that have been made. A blanket negation of natural theology, they say, implicitly denies the goodness of creation and the rationality of faith.

Barth’s school responds by accusing Thomism of domesticating revelation under a metaphysics driven more by Aristotle than by Scripture. The existential distance between the sinner and the holy God can never be bridged by ascending causal reasoning. Furthermore, they argue, what passes as natural theology in practice often yields a generic theism that cannot be concretely identified with the God of the gospel. Any **analogia entis** that one might propose must be crucified and resurrected in the light of the cross and resurrection; there is no straight road from naked being to the triune God.

A Reformed covenantal position, in my judgment, can and should mediate here by affirming a properly delimited **analogia entis** that is already shaped by **creation**, **covenant**, and **Christology**, and by insisting that the fullness of **analogia fidei** governs and corrects our natural knowledge. First, ontologically, the Creator–creature relation instituted in Genesis establishes a real analogy of being: creatures reflect God as images within a created order that is very good and transparently revelatory. This is not a neutral metaphysical fabric, but the stage of the covenant. The very structure of creatureliness, including rationality and moral conscience, is a participatory gift. In this sense, Aquinas and Przywara are fundamentally right to say that there is an ordered similarity grounded in God’s causal primacy and that this grounds meaningful predication.

Second, epistemologically, however, due to sin, this ontological relation is never epistemically neutral. All natural knowledge of God is covenantal: fallen humans encounter general revelation as demand and judgment and react in suppression. Romans 1 must be read in light of the whole canon. This means that while the ontological **analogia entis** remains, the only saving and rightly ordered knowledge arises where the **analogia fidei** is established by the Spirit’s giving of faith through the Word. Here Barth’s protest is salutary as a check against a speculative natural theology that ignores guilt and grace.

Third, linguistically, this position preserves the necessity of **analogical predication**: our theological concepts are true yet creaturely. With Aquinas and Bavinck, we deny univocity, especially in its Scotist sense of a common concept of being embracing God and creatures, since that would erode **divine simplicity** and aseity. We also deny equivocity or radical negative theology, since that would contradict God’s self‑communication and render Scripture’s affirmations vacuous. The analogical character of theological language is thus tied to the ectypal status of our knowledge: God’s own self‑knowledge is archetypal, ours is derivative; yet the content is genuinely corresponding because God has constructed both creation and revelation.

Contemporary debates on theological language and metaphysics further test this position. Some analytic theologians attempt to model analogy using tools from philosophy of language, sometimes pressing in a more univocal direction for the sake of clarity. Postmetaphysical and postliberal theologians, influenced by Barth and later Wittgensteinian themes, tend to resist strong claims about metaphysical structures like **analogia entis**, emphasizing instead the grammar internal to the scriptural narrative and the practices of the church. Meanwhile, ecumenical dialogues have re‑read Barth more sympathetically, suggesting that what he rejected was less the Thomist analogy as such and more a decadent version that functioned as a foundation independent of Christ.

Under oral examination, you should anticipate a challenge like this: does your affirmation of a covenantal **analogia entis** smuggle in an alien metaphysics that stands over Scripture. The answer must be that the metaphysical account is itself exegetically driven. Scripture not only tells us that God created all things by his Word and for his glory, but also that creatures reveal his invisible attributes and that humans remain image‑bearers even in sin. These affirmations have metaphysical implications: there is an ordered likeness between God and creatures grounded in God’s creative act. To deny this, or to treat creation as a merely opaque backdrop to revelation, is to undercut the biblical doctrine of creation and the doctrine of providence, where God continually upholds and addresses the world.

Another likely question: how do you keep your covenantal analogy from collapsing into either Thomism or Barthianism. In distinction from Thomism, one resists constructing a freestanding **natural theology** whose principles are accessible apart from Scripture and faith. The analogical structure of being is read from Scripture and not imposed upon it. In distinction from Barthianism, one affirms that this structure is truly there in the created order as such, so that even unbelievers, while suppressing the truth, genuinely know God and are without excuse. This both intensifies human guilt and underwrites common‑grace discourse in science, philosophy, and culture, where terms like truth, goodness, and beauty genuinely, though imperfectly, resonate with their divine archetypes.

Finally, one must show how this discussion interfaces with adjacent loci. In **Trinitarian theology**, analogy safeguards the simultaneity of divine incomprehensibility and knowledge: our confessing that God is one in essence and three in persons says something true, yet the mode of the divine life remains beyond our comprehension. In **Christology**, the incarnation provides the climactic analogical manifestation: the human nature of Christ, as creaturely, is the supreme site where the **analogia entis** and **analogia fidei** converge, since in him the fullness of deity dwells bodily and is known by faith. In **soteriology**, the Spirit’s work of illumination does not create a new ontology but heals and elevates our analogical capacity, reordering our minds to see creation and Scripture truthfully. In **apologetics**, a Van Tillian presuppositionalism can be articulated as an argument from the impossibility of the contrary, precisely because the entire created order, including the unbeliever’s reasoning, is structured analogically toward God.

The deeper lesson is that the battle slogan “analogia entis versus analogia fidei” can be misleading if it suggests a simple either/or. The Reformed, covenantal position defended here insists that there is a God‑given **analogy of being** rooted in creation and participation, which provides the ontological and semantic conditions under which revelation can be meaningful. Yet this analogy is the theater, not the norm, of theology; theology is governed by the **analogy of faith**, the Spirit‑wrought correspondence between God’s self‑speech in Scripture and the church’s confession. The path between Aquinas and Barth thus lies not in a weak compromise, but in a principled retrieval of **analogical knowledge** that is rigorously trinitarian, Christocentric, and covenantal.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Analogia entis** is the analogy of being, an ontological and semantic correspondence between God and creatures grounded in creation and participation; **analogia fidei** is the analogy of faith, the correspondence between God’s self‑revelation and the believer’s knowledge grounded in Word and Spirit.
- Decisive figures and stance: Aquinas – classical **analogia entis** via participation and causality; Barth – rejection of **analogia entis**, insistence on **analogia fidei** rooted in revelation alone; Przywara – twentieth‑century deepening of **analogia entis** as unity‑in‑tension; Bavinck – Reformed **ectypal** knowledge and analogical predication integrating creation and revelation; Van Til – presuppositional **analogical knowledge** under strong Creator–creature distinction and covenant.
- Debates: Internal – Thomist handling of univocity vs analogy, Reformed tensions over **natural theology** and general revelation; External – Thomist metaphysical realism versus Barthian anti‑natural theology and Reformed critiques of both; Contemporary – analytic models of theological language, postmetaphysical suspicion of **metaphysics**, ecumenical rereadings of Barth and Aquinas.
- Defended position: A Reformed, covenantal account that affirms a real but nonautonomous **analogia entis** grounded in creation and providence, fully normed and completed by **analogia fidei** grounded in Scripture and the Spirit, maintaining the absolute Creator–creature distinction while rejecting both univocity and skeptical equivocity.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - Does Barth deny all natural knowledge of God? He denies constructive natural theology independent of Christ, but acknowledges a judged and distorted knowledge under Romans 1, which Reformed theology must read more robustly.
  - Can you affirm any **analogia entis** as Reformed? Yes, as a covenantal, derivative analogy of being grounded in creation and image‑bearing, never as an autonomous foundation apart from Scripture.
  - How does sin affect analogy. It does not destroy the ontological analogy of being but corrupts its epistemic use, so only **analogia fidei** in Christ yields saving, rightly ordered knowledge.
  - Why not embrace univocal concepts for clarity. Univocity compromises **divine simplicity** and the Creator–creature distinction; analogy preserves true predication while honoring God’s incomprehensibility.
  - How does this relate to apologetics. Because all created reality is structured analogically toward God, unbelieving thought presupposes God even while denying him, which a Van Tillian presuppositionalism exploits by appeal to the impossibility of the contrary.
