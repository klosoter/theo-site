# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer was a leading Dutch Reformed theologian who strongly critiqued the **analogia entis** (analogy of being) as a foundation for knowing God, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith) rooted in **revelation** and **Scripture**. He argued that true knowledge of God is possible only through God's self-disclosure in Christ and the Word, rejecting any natural theology that claims access to God apart from **redemptive history**.

- "The analogia entis is not a bridge but a chasm between God and man." (General Revelation)

## Key Works

- General Revelation (De Algemene Openbaring)
- The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth
- Holy Scripture
- Faith and Revelation
- Studies in Dogmatics (series)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the analogia entis**
    - Denies that human reason or being can provide a natural point of contact with God.
    - Critiques Roman Catholic theology for positing an ontological analogy between Creator and creature.
    - Argues that the analogia entis undermines the radical distinction between God and creation.
    - Sees the analogia entis as incompatible with the Reformation’s doctrine of **sola Scriptura**.
    - "The analogia entis is theologically dangerous because it presumes a continuity that revelation denies." (General Revelation)

2. **Affirmation of the analogia fidei**
    - Emphasizes that knowledge of God is possible only through faith in divine revelation.
    - Grounds theology in the self-revelation of God in Scripture, not in human speculation.
    - Stresses that faith is the only proper response to God’s Word.
    - Sees the analogia fidei as preserving the Creator-creature distinction while allowing true knowledge of God.
    - "Faith itself is the analogical bond, not being, but the response to revelation." (General Revelation)

3. **Primacy of revelation in theology**
    - Asserts that all theological knowledge must begin with God’s initiative in revelation.
    - Rejects any autonomous philosophical starting point for theology.
    - Holds that revelation is both propositional and personal, centered in Christ.
    - Maintains that Scripture is the normative witness to God’s self-disclosure.
    - "Revelation is not a supplement to human knowledge, but its radical reorientation." (Faith and Revelation)

4. **Christocentric epistemology**
    - Insists that Christ is the center and content of all true knowledge of God.
    - Argues that the incarnation is the definitive act of divine self-revelation.
    - Sees all analogical knowledge as mediated through Christ and the Spirit.
    - Rejects any abstract or speculative knowledge of God apart from Christ.
    - "In Christ, the distance between God and man is bridged, not by being, but by grace." (The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth)

5. **Critical engagement with natural theology**
    - Recognizes the reality of general revelation but denies its sufficiency for saving knowledge.
    - Warns against constructing theology on the basis of philosophical or natural categories.
    - Affirms that creation testifies to God, but only Scripture interprets this testimony rightly.
    - Engages Roman Catholic and neo-orthodox views critically, seeking a Reformed balance.
    - "General revelation is not a foundation for theology, but a witness interpreted by faith." (General Revelation)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s critique of the **analogia entis** shaped twentieth-century Reformed theology’s approach to the relationship between **revelation** and reason. His insistence on the **analogia fidei** reinforced the centrality of Scripture and faith in theological method, influencing both academic and ecclesial discussions. Berkouwer’s careful engagement with Roman Catholic and Barthian thought made him a pivotal figure in ecumenical dialogue, while his work continues to inform debates on the limits of natural theology and the necessity of divine self-revelation.
