# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the relationship between **God and humanity** by emphasizing the immediacy of **religious experience** and the limits of human knowledge of the divine. In the debate between **analogia entis** (analogy of being) and **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith), Schleiermacher rejected both traditional Thomistic metaphysics and strict confessionalism, proposing instead that all God-talk arises from the **feeling of absolute dependence** and is mediated through the **Christian community**. His approach privileges the **subjective consciousness** of faith over metaphysical speculation.

- "The essence of religion consists in the feeling of an absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
   - True knowledge of God is rooted in the **feeling of absolute dependence**.
   - Religious language is expressive, not descriptive, of metaphysical realities.
   - The **subjective consciousness** is the locus of revelation.
   - Theology articulates the communal experience of faith, not objective analogies.
   - "Religion’s essence is neither thinking nor acting, but intuition and feeling." (On Religion)

2. **Rejection of Analogia Entis**
   - Denies a direct ontological analogy between God and creation.
   - Critiques metaphysical speculation as inadequate for expressing divine reality.
   - Argues that **God’s being** is qualitatively distinct from human being.
   - Emphasizes the infinite qualitative difference between God and humanity.
   - "God is not an object among objects, nor is He to be found by analogy with finite being." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Mediation through the Christian Community**
   - Doctrine arises from the **corporate consciousness** of the church.
   - Theological statements reflect the faith of the community, not metaphysical truths.
   - The **analogia fidei** is reinterpreted as the shared experience of redemption.
   - Scripture and tradition are expressions of communal faith, not direct analogies.
   - "Dogmatic statements are accounts of the Christian religious self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Christ as the Archetype of God-Consciousness**
   - Christ uniquely embodies the perfect **God-consciousness**.
   - The analogy between God and humanity is mediated through Christ’s person.
   - Christ’s role is existential and exemplary, not metaphysical.
   - The believer’s relationship to God is patterned after Christ’s consciousness.
   - "In Christ, the divine essence is revealed in the highest possible form of human consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Doctrine as Expression, Not Explanation**
   - Doctrines express the **inner life of faith**, not metaphysical realities.
   - Theological language is symbolic and poetic, not strictly analogical.
   - The **analogia fidei** is a function of faith’s self-understanding.
   - Theological statements are provisional and historically conditioned.
   - "Dogmatics is the science which presents the Christian faith in its essence as it exists at any given time." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reorientation of theology around **religious experience** profoundly shaped modern Protestant thought, moving the focus from metaphysical analogies to the **subjective consciousness** of faith. His critique of the **analogia entis** influenced later theologians, including Barth, who saw him as both a precursor and a foil. Schleiermacher’s emphasis on the communal and expressive nature of doctrine continues to inform contemporary debates on the nature of **revelation** and the limits of theological language. His legacy endures in the ongoing tension between **faith and reason** in modern theology.
