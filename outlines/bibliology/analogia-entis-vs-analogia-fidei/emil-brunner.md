# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner was a leading figure in **dialectical theology** who engaged deeply with the debate between **analogia entis** (analogy of being) and **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith). Brunner rejected the Thomistic **analogia entis** as a basis for knowing God, insisting instead that true knowledge of God comes only through **revelation** and the **encounter** between God and humanity in Christ. He maintained that human reason is insufficient for grasping divine reality apart from the self-disclosure of God.

- "There is no way from us to God—not even a via negativa—not even a via dialectica nor paradoxica. The God who stood at the end of all these ways was not God but a mere idol, the projection of our own thoughts." (Nature and Grace)

## Key Works

- Nature and Grace: A Discussion with Karl Barth
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- Dogmatics, Vol. 1: The Christian Doctrine of God
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the analogia entis**
    - Brunner argued that the **analogia entis** presumes a continuity between God and creation that undermines divine transcendence.
    - He saw the analogy of being as a product of **natural theology**, which he believed was fundamentally flawed after the Fall.
    - Brunner insisted that any attempt to know God apart from revelation leads to idolatry.
    - He critiqued Roman Catholic theology for relying on philosophical speculation rather than biblical revelation.
    - "The analogia entis is the invention of Antichrist." (Nature and Grace)

2. **Primacy of revelation in the analogia fidei**
    - Brunner held that knowledge of God is possible only through God's **self-revelation** in Christ.
    - The **analogia fidei** emphasizes the discontinuity between Creator and creature, bridged only by grace.
    - Faith is not a human achievement but a response to the divine initiative.
    - The encounter with God is always mediated by the Word and the Spirit, not by human reason.
    - "Faith is the act in which man is grasped by God’s revelation." (Revelation and Reason)

3. **Affirmation of a "point of contact" (Anknüpfungspunkt)**
    - Brunner controversially argued that there remains a vestige of the **imago Dei** that allows for the possibility of revelation.
    - This "point of contact" is not a capacity for God, but a relational openness created and addressed by God.
    - He distinguished his view from both Barth’s total denial and Roman Catholic optimism about human nature.
    - The point of contact is actualized only in the event of revelation, not as an inherent human faculty.
    - "The possibility of revelation is grounded in the fact that man is created in the image of God." (Nature and Grace)

4. **Christocentric epistemology**
    - For Brunner, all true knowledge of God is mediated through **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ is both the content and the means of revelation, excluding any independent natural knowledge of God.
    - The **analogia fidei** is realized in the believer’s relationship with Christ, not in abstract metaphysics.
    - The incarnation is the decisive event in which God makes Himself known to humanity.
    - "In Jesus Christ, God Himself becomes the answer to our question about Him." (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

5. **Critical engagement with natural theology**
    - Brunner acknowledged the human search for God but denied its sufficiency for saving knowledge.
    - He maintained that **natural revelation** is ambiguous and must be interpreted in light of special revelation.
    - Brunner’s position sought a middle way between Barth’s radical rejection and Roman Catholic affirmation of natural theology.
    - He argued that creation points to God but cannot reveal Him savingly apart from Christ.
    - "Nature does not reveal God as Redeemer; only revelation does that." (Nature and Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s critique of the **analogia entis** and his defense of the **analogia fidei** shaped Protestant debates about revelation, reason, and the limits of natural theology. His nuanced position on the "point of contact" sparked significant controversy, especially with Karl Barth, and remains a reference point in discussions of **revelation** and **epistemology**. Brunner’s work continues to influence Reformed and ecumenical theology, particularly in articulating the boundaries between faith and reason. His insistence on the centrality of Christ and revelation has left a lasting mark on twentieth-century theology.
