# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas is the foremost medieval proponent of the **analogia entis** (analogy of being), a doctrine asserting that human language about God is neither univocal nor purely equivocal but analogical, grounded in the real participation of creatures in the being of God. For Aquinas, **natural theology** is possible because there is a genuine, though analogical, correspondence between **created being** and **divine being**, allowing reason to know God from the created order. This stands in contrast to later Reformed emphases on the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith), which roots theological knowledge in **revelation** rather than being.

- "Between creator and creature no similitude can be expressed without implying a greater dissimilitude." (Summa Contra Gentiles I.30)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I, q.13 ("The Names of God")
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book I
- De Veritate, q.2 ("On the Mode of Divine Knowledge")
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- F.C. Copleston, Aquinas (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Analogy of Being as the Foundation of Theological Language**
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - Analogy is possible because creatures participate in God's being.
    - This participation grounds the possibility of **natural theology**.
    - The analogy of being preserves both God's transcendence and immanence.
    - "All our knowledge of God is derived from creatures." (Summa Theologiae I, q.12, a.12)

2. **Distinction Between Creator and Creature**
    - There is an infinite qualitative difference between God and creation.
    - Any similarity between God and creatures implies a greater dissimilarity.
    - The doctrine of analogy safeguards against collapsing God into creation.
    - The **doctrine of participation** explains how creatures reflect God's being.
    - "Between God and creatures there is no similarity so great that a greater dissimilarity cannot be seen between them." (Fourth Lateran Council, cited in Summa Contra Gentiles I.30)

3. **Possibility of Natural Knowledge of God**
    - Human reason can attain true, though limited, knowledge of God from creation.
    - The **analogia entis** undergirds arguments for God's existence (e.g., the Five Ways).
    - This knowledge is preparatory for, but not identical with, knowledge by faith.
    - Natural theology is possible because of the real participation of creatures in God.
    - "We know God more perfectly according as many and more perfect effects of His are demonstrated to us." (Summa Theologiae I, q.12, a.12)

4. **Theological Epistemology: Faith Perfects Reason**
    - Reason provides genuine, though analogical, knowledge of God.
    - **Faith** is necessary for knowledge of mysteries beyond reason (e.g., Trinity).
    - There is a harmony, not a conflict, between faith and reason.
    - The analogy of being allows for a gradation of knowledge, from natural to revealed.
    - "Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.8)

5. **Rejection of Pure Univocity or Equivocity**
    - Univocal language would compromise divine transcendence.
    - Equivocal language would make theology impossible.
    - Analogy is the only way to speak truly, though imperfectly, of God.
    - This approach shapes Aquinas’s doctrine of **divine names**.
    - "Names said of God and creatures are said neither in a purely equivocal nor in a purely univocal sense, but in an analogical sense." (Summa Theologiae I, q.13, a.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of the **analogia entis** became foundational for Roman Catholic theology and shaped subsequent debates about the possibility and limits of **natural theology**. His approach was later critiqued by Protestant theologians, especially those emphasizing the **analogia fidei** and the primacy of revelation. The analogia entis remains a central point of dialogue and contention between Catholic and Reformed traditions, influencing figures such as Karl Barth and shaping twentieth-century theological discourse. Aquinas’s careful articulation of analogy continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between **reason, revelation, and theological language**.
