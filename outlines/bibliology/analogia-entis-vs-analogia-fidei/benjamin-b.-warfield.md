# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield firmly rejected the **analogia entis** (analogy of being) as a basis for theological knowledge, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith) grounded in **Scripture’s self-attestation** and the **Reformed doctrine of revelation**. For Warfield, true knowledge of God is possible only through **divine self-disclosure** in Scripture, not through speculative reasoning from creation or human nature.

- "The Bible is the Word of God in such a sense that whatever it says, God says." (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)

## Key Works

- The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible
- Revelation and Inspiration
- Calvin and Calvinism
- The Plan of Salvation
- Selected Shorter Writings (esp. essays on revelation and knowledge of God)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Redemptive and Special**
    - God’s self-revelation is given supremely in Scripture, not in nature.
    - **General revelation** is insufficient for saving knowledge of God.
    - The **analogia fidei** arises from God’s initiative in revealing Himself.
    - Human knowledge of God is dependent on God’s gracious act of communication.
    - "Revelation is thus always supernatural, and always redemptive." (Revelation and Inspiration)

2. **Rejection of Analogia Entis**
    - Warfield opposes the idea that human reason or being can ascend to God.
    - The **analogia entis** is seen as a Roman Catholic error, undermining sola Scriptura.
    - Human nature is not a reliable analog for divine being due to the noetic effects of sin.
    - True knowledge of God is not accessible through metaphysical speculation.
    - "The Reformation was, above all, a great revival of religion, and it was a great revival of religion because it was a great revival of theology." (Calvin and Calvinism)

3. **Scripture as the Norming Norm**
    - The **analogia fidei** means Scripture interprets Scripture.
    - Doctrinal coherence is achieved by reading all texts in light of the whole canon.
    - The authority of Scripture is self-authenticating and ultimate.
    - Theological method is grounded in exegesis, not philosophical analogy.
    - "The Bible is the norm of faith, the only rule of faith and practice." (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)

4. **Christocentric Revelation**
    - The fullness of God’s revelation is found in the person and work of Christ.
    - All knowledge of God is mediated through the incarnate Word.
    - The **analogia fidei** centers on Christ as the interpretive key to Scripture.
    - Warfield emphasizes the unity of Old and New Testaments in Christ.
    - "Christ is the key to the Scriptures, and the Scriptures are the key to Christ." (Selected Shorter Writings)

5. **Dependence on the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit enables true understanding of divine revelation.
    - Human reason is insufficient apart from the Spirit’s illumination.
    - The **analogia fidei** is not merely a hermeneutical principle but a spiritual reality.
    - Faith itself is a gift, not a human achievement.
    - "The Spirit who gave the Word must also give the understanding of the Word." (Revelation and Inspiration)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **analogia fidei** shaped twentieth-century Reformed theology’s approach to revelation and epistemology. His critique of the **analogia entis** reinforced the Protestant commitment to **sola Scriptura** and the sufficiency of special revelation. Warfield’s influence persists in debates over the relationship between reason, nature, and Scripture, especially in confessional Reformed circles. His work remains a touchstone for discussions of theological method and the nature of divine knowledge.
