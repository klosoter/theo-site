# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth was the most prominent critic of the **analogia entis** (analogy of being), which he saw as a fundamental error in Roman Catholic theology, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith) as the only proper basis for knowledge of God. For Barth, **revelation** is wholly grounded in God's sovereign self-disclosure in Christ, making all human attempts to know God apart from this revelation not only futile but idolatrous.

- "The analogia entis is the invention of Antichrist, and I think that because of it I have to reject Catholicism fundamentally." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1 (The Doctrine of the Word of God)
- Church Dogmatics II/1 (The Doctrine of God)
- Anselm: Fides Quaerens Intellectum
- Protestant Theology in the Nineteenth Century
- The Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is God's Self-Disclosure**
    - God can only be known as He reveals Himself; human reason cannot ascend to God.
    - **Revelation** is a free act of God, not a human achievement.
    - Jesus Christ is the center and content of all true revelation.
    - The **Word of God** is the sole source of theological knowledge.
    - "God reveals Himself. He reveals Himself through Himself. He reveals Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Rejection of the Analogia Entis**
    - The **analogia entis** presumes a continuity between God and creation that Barth denies.
    - Barth sees this analogy as a theological foundation for natural theology, which he rejects.
    - He argues that it leads to idolatry by projecting human concepts onto God.
    - For Barth, only God can establish the possibility of knowledge of Himself.
    - "The analogia entis is the invention of Antichrist." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **Affirmation of the Analogia Fidei**
    - The **analogia fidei** is grounded in faith and revelation, not in being.
    - Knowledge of God is possible only through God's gracious initiative.
    - Faith is the response to God's self-revelation, not a human capacity.
    - The analogy is established and maintained by the Holy Spirit.
    - "The analogy between God and man is not an analogy of being but an analogy of faith." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

4. **Christocentric Epistemology**
    - Jesus Christ is the only true revelation of God to humanity.
    - All theological knowledge must be measured by the person and work of Christ.
    - There is no independent access to God apart from Christ.
    - The **incarnation** is the decisive event for understanding God and humanity.
    - "In Jesus Christ God reveals Himself as the One who loves in freedom." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

5. **Critique of Natural Theology**
    - Barth rejects all forms of **natural theology** as attempts to know God apart from revelation.
    - He opposes any theological method that begins with human experience or reason.
    - The knowledge of God is always a miracle of grace, not a human achievement.
    - The church must resist all attempts to ground theology in anything other than God's Word.
    - "There is no such thing as a knowledge of God from nature." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth's rejection of the **analogia entis** and his insistence on the **analogia fidei** reshaped twentieth-century Protestant theology, especially in its understanding of **revelation** and the limits of human reason. His Christocentric approach challenged both Roman Catholic and liberal Protestant traditions, leading to renewed debates about the relationship between faith and reason. Barth's influence endures in contemporary discussions of **revelation**, epistemology, and the proper method of theology.
