# Bruce McCormack (1956– )

Bruce McCormack is a leading interpreter of **Karl Barth** and a prominent critic of the **analogia entis** (analogy of being), advocating instead for the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith) as the proper basis for theological knowledge. He argues that true knowledge of God is grounded in **divine self-revelation** rather than any inherent analogy between God and creation, aligning with a **Christocentric** and **revelational** epistemology.

- "The analogia entis is not only not the solution, it is the problem." (Orthodox and Modern, p. 109)

## Key Works

- Karl Barth’s Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology: Its Genesis and Development, 1909–1936
- Orthodox and Modern: Studies in the Theology of Karl Barth
- “Karl Barth’s Christology as a Resource for a Reformed Version of Kenoticism” (International Journal of Systematic Theology)
- “What’s at Stake in Current Debates over Justification?” (in Justification: What’s at Stake in the Current Debates)
- “The Being of God as Event: A Reading of Barth’s Doctrine of God” (in The Cambridge Companion to Karl Barth)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the Analogia Entis**
    - The **analogia entis** posits a metaphysical similarity between God and creation, which McCormack sees as undermining the **Creator-creature distinction**.
    - He argues that this analogy leads to a natural theology independent of **special revelation**.
    - McCormack follows Barth in viewing the analogia entis as a root of theological error, especially in Roman Catholic thought.
    - He insists that any knowledge of God must be grounded in God’s self-disclosure, not in human capacities.
    - "Barth’s rejection of the analogia entis was, at its root, a rejection of any form of natural theology." (Orthodox and Modern, p. 109)

2. **Primacy of the Analogia Fidei**
    - The **analogia fidei** asserts that knowledge of God is possible only through **faith** in response to **revelation**.
    - McCormack emphasizes that God is known as He gives Himself to be known in Christ and Scripture.
    - This approach maintains the **sovereignty of revelation** and the **freedom of God**.
    - It safeguards against projecting human concepts onto God.
    - "The analogia fidei is grounded in the event of revelation, not in any metaphysical structure of being." (Orthodox and Modern, p. 111)

3. **Christocentric Epistemology**
    - All true knowledge of God is mediated through **Jesus Christ** as the locus of revelation.
    - McCormack stresses that Christ is both the Revealer and the content of revelation.
    - This Christocentrism rules out any independent access to God apart from Christ.
    - It shapes the entire structure of theological method and doctrine.
    - "For Barth, the analogia fidei is nothing other than the Christological determination of all knowledge of God." (Karl Barth’s Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology, p. 452)

4. **Doctrine of Revelation**
    - Revelation is an act of God’s **sovereign self-disclosure** rather than a communication of information about a pre-existing divine essence.
    - McCormack highlights the event-character of revelation, emphasizing its dynamic and personal nature.
    - He rejects any static or abstract concept of God that can be accessed apart from revelation.
    - This commitment undergirds his critique of the analogia entis.
    - "God is who He is in the act of His self-revelation and not otherwise." (Orthodox and Modern, p. 120)

5. **Reformed Critique of Natural Theology**
    - McCormack stands in the **Reformed tradition** that is skeptical of natural theology’s ability to yield true knowledge of God.
    - He argues that natural theology inevitably leads to a domestication of God.
    - The analogia entis is seen as a theological compromise with philosophical metaphysics.
    - Only revelation, received by faith, provides a secure foundation for theology.
    - "The Reformed tradition’s suspicion of natural theology is vindicated in Barth’s rejection of the analogia entis." (Orthodox and Modern, p. 113)

## Legacy and Impact

Bruce McCormack’s work has been pivotal in the **Barth renaissance** within contemporary theology, especially in debates over the relationship between **revelation** and **natural theology**. His rigorous defense of the **analogia fidei** has shaped discussions on theological epistemology, Christology, and the doctrine of God. McCormack’s scholarship continues to influence Reformed and ecumenical conversations, reinforcing the centrality of **divine self-revelation** and the rejection of metaphysical speculation apart from Christ.
