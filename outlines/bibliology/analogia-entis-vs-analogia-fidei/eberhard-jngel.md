# Eberhard Jüngel (1934–2021)

Eberhard Jüngel was a leading Lutheran theologian who decisively rejected the **analogia entis** as a foundation for knowing God, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei** grounded in **God’s self-revelation in Christ**. For Jüngel, genuine knowledge of God is possible only through the dynamic event of **revelation** in the **Word of God**, not through metaphysical speculation or natural theology.

- "The analogia entis is not only not a presupposition of faith, it is its undoing." (God as the Mystery of the World)

## Key Works

- God as the Mystery of the World (Gott als Geheimnis der Welt)
- The Doctrine of the Trinity: God's Being Is in Becoming
- Karl Barth: A Theological Legacy
- Theological Essays (various essays on revelation and analogy)
- Entsprechungen: Gott, Wahrheit, Mensch (Correspondences: God, Truth, Human)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the analogia entis**
    - Argues that the analogy of being presumes a continuity between God and creation apart from revelation.
    - Views the analogia entis as the basis for **natural theology**, which he opposes.
    - Follows Karl Barth in seeing the analogia entis as a denial of the radical distinction between **Creator and creature**.
    - Believes it undermines the uniqueness of **God’s self-revelation in Christ**.
    "The analogia entis is the invention of the Antichrist." (God as the Mystery of the World)

2. **Primacy of the analogia fidei**
    - Asserts that knowledge of God is possible only through faith grounded in **revelation**.
    - The analogy of faith is rooted in the correspondence between **God’s Word** and human response.
    - Emphasizes that faith is a gift, not a human achievement or metaphysical capacity.
    - The analogia fidei safeguards the transcendence and freedom of God.
    "Faith alone is the place where God can be known as God." (God as the Mystery of the World)

3. **Revelation as event**
    - Revelation is not a static deposit but a dynamic event in which God addresses humanity.
    - The event of revelation is centered in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Human knowledge of God is always dependent on God’s initiative in revelation.
    - The **Word of God** is both the medium and content of revelation.
    "God happens—God comes to us—in the event of his Word." (God as the Mystery of the World)

4. **Christocentric epistemology**
    - Jesus Christ is the sole mediator of knowledge of God.
    - All theological reflection must be oriented to the reality disclosed in Christ.
    - Rejects any epistemology that bypasses the **incarnation** and cross.
    - The resurrection is the decisive event that grounds Christian knowledge of God.
    "God’s being is in becoming, and this becoming is revealed in Jesus Christ." (The Doctrine of the Trinity)

5. **Critique of metaphysical theology**
    - Opposes attempts to know God through abstract metaphysical speculation.
    - Argues that metaphysics tends to domesticate the **mystery of God**.
    - Theological language must be shaped by the grammar of faith, not philosophy.
    - Insists on the priority of **biblical revelation** over philosophical categories.
    "Theology must learn to speak of God by listening to God’s own speech." (God as the Mystery of the World)

## Legacy and Impact

Jüngel’s robust defense of the **analogia fidei** has significantly shaped modern Protestant theology, especially in its critique of **natural theology** and metaphysical approaches to God. His work deepened the Barthian tradition, emphasizing the centrality of **revelation** and the event-character of God’s self-disclosure. Jüngel’s insistence on the primacy of Christ and the Word continues to influence contemporary debates on the relationship between faith and reason. His legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the proper basis for theological knowledge and the limits of human reason before the mystery of God.
