# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther decisively rejected the **analogia entis** (analogy of being), insisting that knowledge of God comes only through the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith), grounded in **revelation** and **justification by faith**. For Luther, fallen human reason is incapable of ascending to God; instead, God must reveal Himself through **Scripture** and the person of **Christ**, making faith the sole means of true theological knowledge.

- "Between God and us there is no analogy of being, but only an analogy of relationship or of faith." (WA 39/2, 92)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Lectures on Romans (1515–1516)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- Three Treatises (1520)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the Analogia Entis**
    - Denies that there is a natural analogy between God’s being and human being.
    - Argues that human reason is radically corrupted by sin and cannot ascend to God.
    - Sees the analogia entis as a foundation for speculative theology, which he opposes.
    - Insists that attempts to know God apart from revelation lead to idolatry.
    - "The theologian of glory calls evil good and good evil. The theologian of the cross calls the thing what it actually is." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 21)

2. **Primacy of the Analogia Fidei**
    - Affirms that knowledge of God is possible only through faith in His self-revelation.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of **Scripture** as the norm for all theology.
    - Holds that faith receives and interprets God’s revelation, not reason.
    - Maintains that God is known only as He reveals Himself, especially in Christ.
    - "God can be found only in suffering and the cross." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 20)

3. **Theology of the Cross**
    - Contrasts the **theologian of the cross** with the **theologian of glory**.
    - Asserts that God reveals Himself in hiddenness, particularly in Christ’s suffering.
    - Rejects any attempt to know God through human speculation or metaphysics.
    - Sees the cross as the only true locus of divine revelation.
    - "He who does not know Christ does not know God hidden in suffering." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 21)

4. **Radical Dependence on Revelation**
    - Holds that God’s essence remains hidden apart from His self-disclosure.
    - Insists that all true knowledge of God is a gift, not an achievement of reason.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of the **Word of God** for any knowledge of God.
    - Rejects natural theology as a path to salvific knowledge.
    - "Let the man who would hear God speak, read Holy Scripture." (LW 52:12)

5. **Doctrine of Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Connects the analogia fidei to the doctrine of **justification**.
    - Argues that faith alone unites the believer to Christ and His benefits.
    - Maintains that justification is entirely God’s work, not a human achievement.
    - Sees justification as the interpretive key to all theology.
    - "Faith is a living, daring confidence in God’s grace." (Preface to Romans, LW 35:370)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s rejection of the **analogia entis** and his emphasis on the **analogia fidei** shaped the trajectory of Protestant theology, especially in its suspicion of natural theology and speculative metaphysics. His focus on **revelation**, **Scripture**, and the **theology of the cross** continues to influence Reformed and Lutheran traditions. Luther’s stance set a precedent for later theologians like Karl Barth, who also repudiated the analogia entis. The distinction between these two analogies remains a central issue in debates over the relationship between faith, reason, and revelation.
