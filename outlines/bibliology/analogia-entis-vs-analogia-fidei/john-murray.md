# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray firmly rejected the **analogia entis** as a basis for theological knowledge, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei**—the analogy of faith—as the only proper ground for understanding the relationship between God and humanity. For Murray, **revelation** is the sole source of true knowledge of God, and all theological reasoning must be governed by **Scripture** rather than speculative metaphysics.

- "There is no analogy of being between God and man; there is only the analogy of faith." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Key Works

- "The Theology of Karl Barth" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 4)
- Principles of Conduct
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT)
- "Systematic Theology" lectures (Westminster Theological Seminary archives)
- Redemption Accomplished and Applied

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is exclusively scriptural**
   - Divine self-disclosure comes only through **special revelation**.
   - **Scripture** is the normative and sufficient source for theology.
   - Human knowledge of God is dependent on God’s initiative in revelation.
   - Rejects all natural theology as a basis for knowing God.
   - "The only way by which we can know God is by what he has revealed to us in his Word." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

2. **Denial of analogia entis**
   - Rejects the idea of a metaphysical analogy of being between God and creatures.
   - Sees analogia entis as undermining the **Creator-creature distinction**.
   - Critiques Roman Catholic and neo-orthodox uses of analogia entis.
   - Argues it leads to speculative theology apart from revelation.
   - "The analogia entis is theologically disastrous because it blurs the distinction between God and man." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

3. **Affirmation of analogia fidei**
   - The analogy of faith means interpreting Scripture by Scripture.
   - All theological statements must be tested by the **whole counsel of God**.
   - The unity and coherence of biblical revelation are foundational.
   - The analogia fidei safeguards the transcendence and sovereignty of God.
   - "The analogy of faith is the principle that Scripture interprets Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

4. **Doctrine of God’s incomprehensibility**
   - God is truly known but never exhaustively comprehended.
   - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
   - The **Creator-creature distinction** is maintained in all theological formulation.
   - Incomprehensibility does not mean unknowability, but qualitative difference.
   - "We know God truly, but never as he knows himself." (Principles of Conduct)

5. **Opposition to speculative metaphysics**
   - Theology must avoid philosophical speculation not grounded in revelation.
   - Theological method is exegetical and confessional, not philosophical.
   - The **Reformed tradition** is characterized by its commitment to biblical authority.
   - Speculative approaches risk distorting the gospel and the knowledge of God.
   - "Theology must be governed by the exegesis of Scripture, not by metaphysical speculation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s rigorous defense of the **analogia fidei** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology’s approach to the doctrine of God and theological method. His rejection of the **analogia entis** reinforced the Westminster tradition’s emphasis on the sufficiency and primacy of Scripture. Murray’s influence persists in contemporary debates over natural theology, revelation, and the proper boundaries of systematic theology within confessional Reformed circles.
