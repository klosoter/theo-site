# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich rejected the **analogia entis** as a basis for theology, arguing that it leads to a problematic separation between God and the world. Instead, he advanced an **analogia fidei** approach, emphasizing that knowledge of God is possible only through **revelation** and the **self-disclosure of God** in history, particularly in **Jesus as the Christ**. Tillich’s method of **correlation** sought to relate existential human questions to theological answers, insisting that all theological language is **symbolic** and participates analogically in the reality of God.

- "The question of God cannot be answered by any analogy of being, but only by an analogy of faith." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the analogia entis**
    - Tillich argued that the **analogia entis** separates God from the world, making God an object among objects.
    - He believed this approach undermines the **transcendence** and **mystery** of God.
    - For Tillich, God is not a being but **Being-Itself**, beyond all finite categories.
    - The analogia entis leads to idolatry by confusing creaturely being with divine being.
    - "The God above God cannot be reached by any analogy of being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Primacy of the analogia fidei**
    - Tillich insisted that knowledge of God comes only through **faith** and **revelation**.
    - The analogia fidei maintains the distinction between Creator and creature while allowing for genuine knowledge of God.
    - Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned, and only in this context does analogy function properly.
    - The analogia fidei is grounded in the event of revelation, not in metaphysical speculation.
    - "Only in the act of faith does the analogy between God and man become real." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Symbolic nature of theological language**
    - All statements about God are **symbolic**, pointing beyond themselves to the divine reality.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point but do not exhaust it.
    - Analogy in theology is possible only through symbols that are rooted in revelation.
    - Literal language about God leads to conceptual idolatry and misunderstanding.
    - "Every theological statement is an assertion about the power of being in which everything participates." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Method of correlation**
    - Tillich’s method relates existential human questions to theological answers.
    - The correlation method avoids both rationalism and fideism by engaging culture and revelation.
    - Analogy is meaningful only within the existential situation of the human subject.
    - The analogia fidei is actualized in the encounter between the human question and the divine answer.
    - "The method of correlation explains the contents of the Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Christ as the center of revelation**
    - For Tillich, the **New Being** in Christ is the ultimate revelation of God.
    - Analogy between God and humanity is realized in the person and work of Christ.
    - Christ is the concrete symbol in whom the analogia fidei is fulfilled.
    - The event of Christ grounds all theological analogy and makes faith possible.
    - "In the Christ event, the divine self-manifestation becomes actual and the analogy of faith is established." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s critique of the **analogia entis** and his development of the **analogia fidei** have had a lasting influence on modern theology, especially in Protestant circles wary of natural theology. His emphasis on **symbolic language** and the **method of correlation** shaped subsequent discussions about the limits and possibilities of theological discourse. Tillich’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to relate Christian faith to existential questions and contemporary culture.
