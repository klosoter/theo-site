# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos firmly rejected the **analogia entis** as a foundation for theology, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei**—the analogy of faith—whereby knowledge of God is possible only through **special revelation** and not through any inherent similarity between Creator and creature. For Vos, the **Creator-creature distinction** is absolute, and any true knowledge of God must be grounded in **Scripture** and the **self-disclosure of God** in redemptive history.

- "The knowledge of God is possible only because God has revealed Himself, not because there is an ontological similarity between God and man." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics (especially Vol. 1: Theology Proper)
- "Revelation and Inspiration" (in The Princeton Theological Review)
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation (collected essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is the sole ground of knowledge of God**
    - True knowledge of God comes only through His **self-revelation**.
    - Human reason, unaided by revelation, cannot ascend to God.
    - The **analogia entis** is rejected as it presumes a metaphysical continuity between God and creation.
    - Vos insists that **Scripture** is the principium cognoscendi of theology.
    - "God can be known only in the manner and to the extent in which He has made Himself known." (Reformed Dogmatics)

2. **Creator-creature distinction is absolute**
    - There is an infinite qualitative difference between God and man.
    - Any analogy must respect the ontological gap between Creator and creature.
    - The **analogia entis** blurs this distinction and leads to natural theology.
    - Vos upholds the **Reformed emphasis** on the transcendence of God.
    - "The distance between God and the creature is not one of degree, but of kind." (Reformed Dogmatics)

3. **Analogia fidei as the proper theological method**
    - The analogy of faith means interpreting Scripture with Scripture.
    - All theological knowledge is mediated through the **Word of God**.
    - The **covenantal structure** of revelation shapes all understanding of God.
    - Vos sees the **analogia fidei** as safeguarding the sovereignty of divine revelation.
    - "The analogy of faith is the principle by which Scripture interprets itself." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Rejection of natural theology as a source of saving knowledge**
    - While general revelation renders all men without excuse, it cannot save.
    - Vos critiques any system that seeks knowledge of God apart from **redemptive revelation**.
    - The **analogia entis** is seen as foundational to Roman Catholic natural theology.
    - Only the **gospel** reveals God as Redeemer in Christ.
    - "Natural theology cannot bridge the gulf between sinful man and the holy God." (Reformed Dogmatics)

5. **Redemptive-historical approach to revelation**
    - Revelation unfolds progressively in history, culminating in Christ.
    - The meaning of revelation is tied to the acts of God in history.
    - The **analogia fidei** is rooted in the unity of redemptive history.
    - Vos’s biblical theology emphasizes the organic unity of God’s self-disclosure.
    - "Revelation is not static, but moves forward with the history of redemption." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s rejection of the **analogia entis** and his robust articulation of the **analogia fidei** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in its approach to revelation and the Creator-creature distinction. His influence is evident in the development of **biblical theology** as a discipline and in the ongoing Reformed critique of natural theology. Vos’s work continues to serve as a bulwark against attempts to ground theology in philosophical or ontological analogies apart from Scripture. His legacy endures in the confessional Reformed tradition’s commitment to the primacy of **special revelation**.
