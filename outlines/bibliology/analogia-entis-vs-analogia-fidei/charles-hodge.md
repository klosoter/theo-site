# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge firmly rejected the **analogia entis**—the notion that there is a natural analogy between God and creation—insisting instead on the **analogia fidei**, where all true knowledge of God is mediated through **divine revelation** and interpreted by faith. Hodge maintained that human reason, while valuable, is insufficient for theology apart from the **Scriptures** and the **Holy Spirit’s illumination**, emphasizing the **Creator-creature distinction** and the necessity of **special revelation** for true knowledge of God.

- "The only knowledge which we have of God is derived from his manifestations of himself." (Systematic Theology, I.339)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles (esp. on natural theology and revelation)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Foundation of Theology**
   - Theology must be grounded in **special revelation**, not in natural analogies.
   - The **Scriptures** are the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
   - Human knowledge of God is dependent on what God has chosen to reveal.
   - The **analogia fidei** ensures that doctrine is derived from the whole counsel of God’s Word.
   - "The Bible is to the theologian what nature is to the man of science." (Systematic Theology, I.10)

2. **Rejection of Analogia Entis**
   - Hodge opposed the idea that there is a direct analogy between God’s being and human being.
   - He argued that **natural theology** is insufficient for salvific knowledge of God.
   - The **Creator-creature distinction** is absolute; God is not to be conceived in terms of human categories.
   - Any knowledge of God from nature is only partial and preparatory, not saving.
   - "There is no analogy between the finite and the infinite, except as revealed by God himself." (Systematic Theology, I.339)

3. **Role of Faith in Knowledge of God**
   - True knowledge of God is possible only through **faith** in God’s revelation.
   - The **analogia fidei** means interpreting Scripture by Scripture, guided by the Spirit.
   - Faith is both the means and the context for theological understanding.
   - Human reason is subordinate to the authority of divine revelation.
   - "Faith is the organ of spiritual discernment." (Systematic Theology, I.47)

4. **Scripture Interprets Scripture**
   - The **analogia fidei** principle requires that unclear passages be interpreted in light of clearer ones.
   - Doctrine must be consistent with the total teaching of Scripture.
   - The unity and harmony of biblical revelation safeguard against error.
   - The church’s historic confessions are valuable insofar as they reflect this scriptural analogy.
   - "The analogy of faith is the scriptural rule that Scripture is its own interpreter." (Systematic Theology, I.187)

5. **Limits of Human Reason**
   - Human reason is finite and fallen, unable to ascend to God apart from revelation.
   - Philosophy and natural theology have a subordinate, not foundational, role in theology.
   - The **analogia entis** risks projecting human attributes onto God, leading to idolatry.
   - True theology is always a response to God’s initiative in revelation, not human speculation.
   - "Reason must be silent where revelation is silent." (Systematic Theology, I.53)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **analogia fidei** shaped the trajectory of **Reformed theology** in America, especially at Princeton Seminary. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the limits of human reason provided a bulwark against both rationalism and speculative theology. Hodge’s legacy endures in confessional Reformed circles, where his commitment to the **Creator-creature distinction** and the authority of revelation remains foundational for systematic theology.
