# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til was a leading Reformed apologist who vigorously rejected the **analogia entis** (analogy of being) as a foundation for knowing God, insisting instead on the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith) grounded in **revelation**. For Van Til, all true knowledge of God is analogical, shaped by the **Creator-creature distinction** and the self-attesting authority of **Scripture**.

- "The analogia entis is the essence of all non-Christian thought." (Christianity and Barthianism)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the analogia entis**
    - Van Til argued that the analogia entis undermines the **Creator-creature distinction** by positing a shared being between God and man.
    - He saw it as the root of **autonomous human reasoning** in theology.
    - The analogia entis leads to a natural theology that is independent of **special revelation**.
    - Van Til believed it inevitably results in a compromise of **biblical authority**.
    "The analogia entis is the essence of all non-Christian thought." (Christianity and Barthianism)

2. **Affirmation of the analogia fidei**
    - True knowledge of God is possible only by analogy, as revealed in **Scripture**.
    - The analogia fidei maintains the **absolute qualitative distinction** between God and man.
    - All human knowledge of God is dependent on **God’s self-revelation**.
    - This approach safeguards the **sovereignty of God** in revelation and knowledge.
    "We must think God’s thoughts after him, analogically, not univocally or equivocally." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Primacy of special revelation**
    - Van Til insisted that **special revelation** is the only sufficient and authoritative source for theology.
    - Natural theology, apart from revelation, is inherently **autonomous** and unreliable.
    - The **self-attesting** nature of Scripture is central to Van Til’s epistemology.
    - Human reason must be subordinate to the **Word of God**.
    "Revelation must be presupposed as the foundation of all knowledge." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Creator-creature distinction**
    - God is **ontologically distinct** from creation; there is no continuum of being.
    - Human knowledge is always **analogical**, never univocal or purely equivocal.
    - The distinction preserves both **divine transcendence** and the possibility of true knowledge.
    - Any system that blurs this distinction is, for Van Til, fundamentally **non-Christian**.
    "There is no point of identity between the divine and the human except by God’s voluntary condescension." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought**
    - Van Til emphasized the **antithesis** between worldviews grounded in revelation and those grounded in human autonomy.
    - The analogia entis is seen as a capitulation to **non-Christian philosophy**.
    - Only the analogia fidei maintains the **uniqueness of Christian theism**.
    - Apologetics must presuppose the **truth of Scripture** rather than seek neutral ground.
    "There is no common ground except that which is provided by God’s revelation." (Christianity and Barthianism)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s critique of the **analogia entis** and his robust defense of the **analogia fidei** have profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and epistemology, especially within the Westminster tradition. His insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the primacy of revelation continues to influence debates on natural theology and theological method. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of **presuppositional apologetics** and in the sharp delineation he drew between Christian and non-Christian systems of thought.
