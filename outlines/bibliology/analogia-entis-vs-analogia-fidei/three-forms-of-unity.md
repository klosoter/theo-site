# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The Three Forms of Unity—comprising the **Belgic Confession**, **Heidelberg Catechism**, and **Canons of Dort**—articulate a distinctly Reformed approach to the knowledge of God, rejecting the **analogia entis** (analogy of being) in favor of the **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith). These confessions emphasize that true knowledge of God is possible only through **special revelation** and the **Scriptures**, not through an inherent metaphysical similarity between God and humanity.

- "We know Him by two means: First, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe... Second, He makes Himself more clearly and fully known to us by His holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Article 2)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 2, 7, and 14
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Lord’s Days 6, 7, and 8
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially the Rejection of Errors
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- The Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (James T. Dennison Jr., ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Sufficient and Necessary**
    - The knowledge of God is grounded in **special revelation**, not in human reason or metaphysical analogy.
    - The Scriptures are the only infallible rule for faith and life.
    - Natural revelation is real but insufficient for saving knowledge of God.
    - The **analogia fidei** governs interpretation: Scripture interprets Scripture.
    - "We believe that those Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

2. **Rejection of Analogia Entis**
    - The confessions deny that there is a shared ontological "being" between God and humanity.
    - Human knowledge of God is not based on metaphysical similarity but on God's self-disclosure.
    - The Creator-creature distinction is maintained rigorously.
    - Any attempt to know God apart from His Word is condemned as idolatry.
    - "We must not presume to be wiser than God, but we must leave those things which He shows us in His Word without inquiring further than our capacity will admit." (Belgic Confession, Article 13)

3. **Christ as the Only Mediator of Knowledge**
    - True knowledge of God comes only through **Jesus Christ** as revealed in Scripture.
    - The **Heidelberg Catechism** emphasizes Christ as the only way to know God rightly.
    - Faith is the means by which believers apprehend divine truth.
    - The **analogia fidei** is Christocentric, centering all knowledge of God in Him.
    - "No man can know God unless God first makes Himself known to him in Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Day 6)

4. **Doctrine of Faith and the Analogy of Faith**
    - The **analogia fidei** is a hermeneutical principle: unclear passages are interpreted in light of clearer ones.
    - The unity and coherence of Scripture are emphasized.
    - Doctrinal formulations must be derived from the whole counsel of God.
    - The confessions warn against speculative theology not grounded in the biblical text.
    - "We believe that this Holy Scripture contains the will of God completely and that everything one must believe to be saved is sufficiently taught in it." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

5. **Total Depravity and the Limits of Natural Reason**
    - Human reason is corrupted by sin and cannot ascend to God unaided.
    - The **Canons of Dort** stress the necessity of grace for any true knowledge of God.
    - The **analogia entis** is rejected as it presumes unaided human capacity to know God.
    - Salvation and knowledge are entirely dependent on divine initiative.
    - "Man by the fall... has so far lost all the excellent gifts which he had received from God... that he has become wicked, perverse, and corrupt in all his ways." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Article 1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have decisively shaped the **Reformed doctrine of revelation**, firmly rejecting the **analogia entis** in favor of the **analogia fidei** as the proper means of knowing God. Their insistence on the sufficiency and necessity of Scripture, the centrality of Christ, and the Creator-creature distinction continues to influence Reformed theology and hermeneutics. These confessions remain foundational for Reformed churches worldwide, safeguarding the church from speculative and natural theology that undermines the primacy of divine revelation.
