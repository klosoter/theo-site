# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose approach to **epistemology** is shaped by a robust commitment to **redemptive-historical revelation** and the centrality of **union with Christ**. He emphasizes that true **knowledge of God** is inseparable from the work of the **Holy Spirit** and is grounded in the self-attesting authority of **Scripture** as the covenantal Word of God.

- "The knowledge of God is always a matter of revelation and response, never of autonomous human discovery." ("Revelation and Tradition," Westminster Theological Journal)

## Key Works

- "Revelation and Tradition: The Influence of the Apostle Paul on the Thought of Herman Ridderbos" (WTJ, 1976)
- "Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit" (1979)
- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation" (2006)
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology" (1978)
- Contributions to "The Infallible Word" (with E.J. Young and others)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Redemptive-Historical**
    - God’s self-disclosure unfolds progressively through the history of redemption.
    - The climax of revelation is in the person and work of **Christ**.
    - Knowledge of God is always **covenantal**, not abstract or philosophical.
    - The unity of **Scripture** is grounded in its redemptive-historical structure.
    "Revelation is inseparable from the history of redemption." ("Revelation and Tradition")

2. **Scripture’s Self-Attestation**
    - **Scripture** is the ultimate authority for knowledge of God.
    - The Bible is self-authenticating and does not appeal to external criteria for validation.
    - Human knowledge of God is dependent on the **Spirit’s witness** through the Word.
    - The sufficiency and clarity of **Scripture** are essential for epistemology.
    "The authority of Scripture is not derived but intrinsic." ("The Infallible Word")

3. **Pneumatological Epistemology**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables true knowledge of God in the believer.
    - Spiritual illumination is necessary for understanding divine revelation.
    - The Spirit applies the Word to the heart, making knowledge of God existentially real.
    - There is no neutral ground; epistemology is always spiritually conditioned.
    "The Spirit is the indispensable agent of all true knowledge of God." ("Perspectives on Pentecost")

4. **Union with Christ as Epistemological Center**
    - All saving knowledge of God is mediated through **union with Christ**.
    - Epistemology is not merely intellectual but participatory in Christ’s resurrection life.
    - Faith-union transforms the believer’s understanding and perception.
    - **Christ** is both the content and means of knowing God.
    "Union with Christ is the central reality of the Christian’s knowledge of God." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

5. **Antithesis and the Noetic Effects of Sin**
    - Human knowledge is radically affected by **sin**, creating an antithesis between belief and unbelief.
    - **Regeneration** is necessary to overcome epistemological rebellion.
    - The noetic effects of sin distort all autonomous attempts to know God.
    - Only in **Christ** is the mind renewed for true knowledge.
    "Apart from regeneration, the knowledge of God is always suppressed in unrighteousness." ("Revelation and Tradition")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary **Reformed epistemology** by integrating **redemptive-historical** and **pneumatological** emphases. His insistence on the centrality of **union with Christ** and the indispensable role of the **Holy Spirit** has influenced generations of Westminster theologians and pastors. Gaffin’s articulation of the antithesis between belief and unbelief continues to inform debates on the nature of knowledge and the authority of **Scripture** within evangelical and confessional circles.
