### ESSAY
Epistemology and the knowledge of God asks how creatures know the Creator and what legitimates their affirmations. The question is not whether humans form concepts about a highest being, but whether those concepts make contact with the living God under the strictures of the Creator–creature distinction, **divine simplicity**, and the fall. To define terms, knowledge of God in Christian theology is true, non-comprehensive, covenantally situated, **analogical knowledge**. It is true because God’s self-revelation does not deceive; non-comprehensive because the infinite cannot be circumscribed by the finite; covenantal because all human knowing occurs as image-bearers addressed by God as Lord; and analogical because our predicates about God neither collapse into univocal sameness with creatures nor evaporate into equivocal emptiness. The core claim I defend is this: God is knowable because and only because he reveals himself in **general revelation** and **special revelation**; this revelation provides the principia, both ontological and epistemic, for all human knowledge; fallen man suppresses this revelation, so only through the **self-authentication** of Scripture and the Spirit’s redemptive work does man come to a saving and rightly basic knowledge; and yet, even the unbeliever’s reason and science traffic in borrowed capital that presupposes the triune God. This covenantal account is metaphysically catholic in affirming the classical doctrine of God and semantically disciplined in its insistence on **analogical knowledge**, while epistemically it is presuppositional and transcendental, supplemented by a proper-function account of **warrant**.

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) supplies the classical architecture for speaking of God and knowing him by nature. In the Summa Theologiae, Aquinas argues that while we cannot know what God is, we can know that God is and what he is not by the via remotionis, and what he is analogically by the via eminentiae. The principle of **analogical predication** frames how created perfections name the uncreated. The predicate wise, applied to God, is neither univocal with creaturely wisdom nor purely equivocal; it is analogical, grounded in causal participation. On this basis, Aquinas defends a restricted **natural theology**. By reasoning from effects to cause in the order of being, the mind can know that there exists an uncaused cause, pure act, the one whose essence is existence, and can derive certain attributes such as simplicity, eternity, immutability, goodness. What it cannot do is penetrate to the mystery of the Trinity, which requires **special revelation**. Aquinas’s project is not rationalist autonomy. The light of human intellect is a created participation in the uncreated light and is ordered toward truth by God’s design. Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it, which for epistemology means revelation heals, completes, and elevates reason. Critics will press whether Aquinas’s causal metaphysics smuggles in an illicit continuity that undermines the Creator–creature distinction, or whether analogy ends in skepticism. The better reading is that Aquinas protects both transcendence and meaningful naming. **Divine simplicity** anchors the unity of God’s perfections, while analogy prevents univocal capture. Thus, Aquinas provides a disciplined semantics and a modest natural knowledge that situates creaturely intellect under God without usurping revelation. 

John Calvin (1509–1564) reframed the Reformed side of the conversation with an insistence on principia. God’s glory is the theater of the world, and all humans possess an ineradicable **sensus divinitatis**, a natural awareness of deity, and a seed of religion that renders them without excuse. Yet this sense is not a self-sufficient source of theology because of the **noetic effects of sin**. Fallen man, in unrighteousness, suppresses the truth disclosed in **general revelation**. Thus, while the heavens declare God’s glory and conscience accuses by the law written on the heart, this knowledge is twisted and idolatrous apart from grace. For Calvin, the principium cognoscendi externum is Scripture, and the internum is the Holy Spirit. Scripture bears its own marks of divinity and is recognized through the Spirit’s internal witness. Only through these spectacles does man read the world rightly. Calvin is not a proto-Barthian in repudiating **natural theology** tout court. He affirms that nature and history truly reveal God, and he can deploy arguments, but he refuses to grant them neutrality or ultimacy. Consequently, both the possibility of knowing God and the pathology of human knowing are bound to **covenant epistemology**, where knowledge exists within a relational structure of obedience and rebellion. Salvation is not a shift from error to information but from suppression to truthful reception of God’s self-disclosure.

Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) reconfigured modern epistemology such that the traditional project of rational theology appeared impossible. The critical turn limited theoretical reason to the conditions of possible experience. Concepts without intuitions are empty, and God, as supersensible, cannot be an object of theoretical cognition. The noumenal realm is unknowable in this sense. God becomes a postulate of practical reason, required for the highest good, but not a being whose existence can be proven by speculative metaphysics. The effect was not the death of religious thought but the transposition of theology into ethics or subjectivity. The old demonstrations whether cosmological or teleological were redescribed as dialectical illusions. Here lies the modern pressure point: if cognition is bounded by finite categories applied to phenomena, then the language of **analogical knowledge** seems either incoherent or smuggled. Kant’s challenge names a real vulnerability: a theology that assumes unexamined access to God as object. The response cannot be a return to precritical naiveté; it must show that revelation, metaphysics, and created cognition interlock in a way that undercuts Kant’s initial framing.

Karl Barth (1886–1968) sought to undercut modern religion as autonomous project by insisting that God is known only where God makes himself known, in Jesus Christ. Against liberal historicism and natural religion, Barth’s Nein to Emil Brunner on natural theology expresses a deep conviction: any appeal to **general revelation** becomes a Trojan horse for human self-assertion. Revelation is event, sovereign act, and there is no access to God in creation or conscience except in and through the event of Christ’s self-witness. Barth’s protest should be received as a prophetic caution about idolatry and an insistence on divine freedom. Yet his position over-corrects. By driving a wedge between creation and reconciliation, he downcuts the creational basis for language about God affirmed in Scripture itself. Romans 1 testifies to a revelation of God in the things that have been made, and Psalm 19 speaks of the heavens pouring forth knowledge. A theology that disallows all **natural theology** undermines the integrity of creation and yields practical incoherence for apologetics and culture-making. Barth’s intention to safeguard the lordship of grace is sound. But the Reformed orthodox already safeguarded it through a robust **federal theology** that binds creation and redemption under one Lord while grading the modes of revelation. Barth sharpened the modern stakes, but his denial cannot carry the exegetical and ecclesial load.

Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987) forms the Westminster bridge between classical Christian theism and an unapologetically presuppositional method. For Van Til, all knowledge is **covenantal**. The triune God is the ultimate reference point for every fact, every law, every inference. There is no brute fact. The mind’s interpretive activity is inescapably ethical, either covenant-keeping or covenant-breaking. He insists on **analogical knowledge** as the only way the creature can think God’s thoughts after him, thereby guarding **divine simplicity** and the Creator–creature distinction. The unbeliever’s reason is not an inert instrument but, as a faculty of a moral agent, is directed against God, although restrained and enabled by common grace. The upshot is methodological. One does not argue from a neutral platform to the high probability of theism. One exposes the autonomy claim as self-destructive and shows that the very possibility of logic, induction, moral normativity, and science presupposes the truth of Christian theism. This is a **transcendental argument**: what are the necessary conditions for the intelligibility of experience? Van Til’s answer is the self-contained ontological Trinity, whose unity and diversity ground the one and the many in knowledge and reality. Scripture, as God’s **self-authenticating** Word, is the principium of theology and the controlling authority for all intellectual endeavors. The charge of fideism or vicious **epistemic circularity** meets a principled reply: ultimate authorities are inescapably circular because they cannot be verified by a higher criterion without ceasing to be ultimate. The question is which circle renders reality intelligible without reducing reason to skepticism or pure will. Van Til does not deny **general revelation**; he denies its autonomous deployment. He also does not reject arguments; he subordinates them to the transcendental critique and presents them within the Christian system. A common examiner challenge is whether Van Til undercuts classical metaphysics. Properly read, he receives the metaphysical grammar of **divine simplicity**, immutability, and analogy, and insists that only such a God can serve as the a priori condition for knowledge. He rejects not Thomas but a certain Enlightenment appropriation of Thomas that abstracts reason from covenantal obedience.

Alvin Plantinga (born 1932) reopens the epistemic status of theistic belief within analytic philosophy. Classical foundationalism had demanded that rational belief either be self-evident, incorrigible, or evident to the senses, or else be inferred therefrom. Belief in God, not meeting these criteria, was deemed irrational unless supported by evidences. Plantinga exposes the arbitrariness of those criteria and proposes that belief in God can be properly basic. In Warranted Christian Belief he frames an Aquinas/Calvin model: God has designed humans with a cognitive faculty, the **sensus divinitatis**, that produces belief in God in appropriate circumstances, and a testimony of the Spirit that produces the great truths of the gospel in those regenerated by grace. On his account, a belief has **warrant** when it is produced by cognitive faculties functioning properly, in a congenial epistemic environment, according to a design plan aimed at truth. If Christianity is true, then theistic and Christian belief can be warranted without propositional evidences. Plantinga also addresses defeaters, evolution, and pluralism. The evolutionary argument against naturalism presses that if our cognitive faculties are aimed primarily at survival, the probability of reliable belief is low, undermining trust in reason under naturalism. On hiddenness and pluralism, he allows that defeaters can be rebutted by the total witness of Scripture, the internal instigation of the Spirit, and the noetic impact of sin. Plantinga’s project is not a comprehensive theology of revelation, but it yields a powerful repair to the rational status of Christian belief and integrates with the Reformed principia by showing that evidentialist strictures are unnecessary for rationality. Some object that this sidelines **natural theology** and apologetics. The better reading is that it relocates their function. Arguments can serve as part of a cumulative case and as a means by which the Spirit removes defeaters, but they are not epistemically mandatory.

Gathering these lines, we can arrange the debates along the promised layers. Internally, within the Reformed and classical traditions, how far can we go with **natural theology**? Aquinas and the Reformed orthodox affirm a real, limited natural knowledge of God’s existence and attributes. Calvin affirms this while highlighting the pathology of suppression and the primacy of Scripture’s **self-authentication**. Barth’s denial is too sweeping and fails to do justice to creation’s clarity. Van Til rejects autonomy, not nature, and insists on the network of presuppositions within which any appeal to nature occurs. Plantinga reframes the rationality question so that theistic belief need not wait on arguments to be justified or warranted. Here is the defended synthesis: affirm a chastened **natural theology** that is ministerial to Scripture, never magisterial, and deployed within **covenant epistemology**. This accepts that general revelation discloses the divine power and deity, that arguments can rightly articulate this disclosure, and that special revelation is necessary for saving knowledge and for the right ordering of all knowledge. It also accepts that the point of contact with unbelievers is not neutral epistemic criteria but shared creatureliness before the same God.

Externally, Kant’s restriction of theoretical knowledge is not the final word. It is framed within a world where revelation is not considered. But if the triune God creates both world and mind, and if he speaks, then the Kantian noumenal barrier is porous not because man vaults it but because God addresses the creature. **Analogical knowledge** is not a covert claim to univocal grasp but an admission that created concepts can be elevated by God’s self-disclosure to truly signify him. The evidentialist constraint that belief require inferential support fails for the same reason: it assumes a narrow and self-contradictory model of rationality. At the same time, Christian theology must discipline its claims with the rules learned from Aquinas’s semantics, Calvin’s principia, and Van Til’s covenantal critique. Against naturalism and scientism, the transcendental move is decisive. The orderliness of nature, the applicability of mathematics, the normativity of logic, the binding character of moral obligation, and the unity and diversity encountered in experience are not plausibly grounded in a closed natural system. Any attempt to justify induction, normativity, or intentionality in pure naturalism either smuggles in teleology or collapses into instrumentalism. The triune God, in whom unity and plurality coinhere without remainder, who creates by Word and Spirit, grounds the metaphysical preconditions for rational inquiry.

In contemporary registers, three pressure points dominate. First, the charge of divine hiddenness asks why a loving God would not make his existence more obvious. The reply runs along several tracks. Scripture affirms that God has made himself plain in the things that are made, that men suppress the truth in unrighteousness, and that God’s ends include drawing a people to himself by grace, not satisfying the demands of autonomous criteria. Epistemic distance serves covenantal testing; divine patience leads to repentance; and God distributes light according to his redemptive purposes. Hiddenness, then, is not a defeater of belief but a misreading of the moral theater of revelation. Second, evolutionary debunking arguments that reduce religious belief to adaptive byproducts undermine themselves. If our cognitive faculties are shaped by survival alone, then our confidence in their truth-tracking is undercut across the board. If, however, our faculties are designed by God for truth through **proper function**, then yes, sin degrades performance, but redemption restores it. Third, peer disagreement and pluralism press the rationality of maintaining faith under contestation. The Reformed answer is that God’s **self-authenticating** Word, the Spirit’s witness, and the lived noetic effects of sanctification establish a higher-order defeater defeater for the force of mere disagreement. At the same time, we are not epistemic isolationists. We receive common grace insights, test them under Scripture, and deploy public reasons that can be understood and sometimes even endorsed by unbelievers, while never granting that such reasons are epistemically ultimate.

Two frequent examiner objections deserve clear answers. First, is not the claim that Scripture is self-authenticating a vicious circle? It is a circle, but not a vice. All systems terminate in an authority. The empiricist cannot justify the reliability of sense experience without appealing to further sense experience or a theory that begs the question. The rationalist cannot establish the binding force of logic without employing logical norms. The Christian claims that the triune God who cannot lie has identified his Word as the canon by which all claims are measured. The circle is controlled by the identity of the ultimate authority and is open enough to invite testing of internal coherence, explanatory power, and existential fit, while never ceding its ultimacy to an external tribunal. Second, does presuppositionalism deny common ground and so make communication impossible? Properly construed, it denies neutral ground, not common ground. The common ground is ontological and epistemic, because all humans live in God’s world and are made in God’s image. This shared reality permits intelligible discourse. Denying neutrality means refusing the fiction that reason functions as a judge indifferent to God. Communication proceeds by pointing to the shared world, exposing the suppressed knowledge of God, and commending the Word through argument, life, and worship.

Conceptually, the defended position binds together Aquinas’s semantics, Calvin’s principia, Van Til’s transcendentalism, and Plantinga’s proper function. We can say of God only what he authorizes us to say, and what he authorizes us to say truly names him analogically, with metaphysical discipline supplied by **divine simplicity**. We know God by nature because he makes himself known in the theater of creation, and we know him savingly because he speaks in Scripture and climactically in Christ. The moral-epistemic pathology of sin does not obliterate knowledge but distorts it; redemption reorients the knower covenantally. The church should neither despise arguments nor idolize them. Theistic proofs, when reconstructed as **transcendental argument** within the Christian system, show that Christianity is not merely one hypothesis among others but the precondition for coherent thought and life. The Reformed epistemologist’s appeal to **warrant** secures the rational permissibility and propriety of belief in God without evidentialist props and explains how justification can be non-inferential yet responsive to defeaters. This synthesis is not a lowest common denominator. It is a principled posture: classical theism and **analogical knowledge** as guardrails for God-talk, **covenant epistemology** and presuppositional method as the backbone for apologetics, and proper-function epistemology as a close-range tool for handling defeaters.

Adjacent loci confirm the integration. Theology proper requires epistemic humility and precision. **Divine simplicity** entails that our distinct predicates do not divide God, which in turn requires analogy and rules out univocity that would compromise transcendence. Christology intensifies the epistemic stakes, for in the incarnate Son we have the definitive self-revelation of God, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. Scripture, as the Spirit-breathed Word, supplies the **principia cognoscendi** for any theology that would be Christian, calibrates the reception of **general revelation**, and bears its own marks of divinity. Ecclesiology matters because the triune God has appointed a community and means of grace for the formation of knowers. Soteriology turns on the renewal of the mind and the liberation of the will such that the sinner moves from suppression to confession. Ethics presupposes knowledge of God as lawgiver and enabler, and it confirms that knowing God is not bare cognition but obedient wisdom.

A final word on method. The presuppositional strategy is often caricatured as an argument from incredulity. Properly executed, it is an argument from the preconditions of intelligibility. The unity of abstract universals and concrete particulars, the rational structure of the cosmos, the binding force of moral normativity, the reliability of cognitive faculties, the personal character of reason itself, and the historicity of meaning are inexplicable within a strictly immanent frame. They cohere within a world created by the triune God, interpreted by his Word, and entered by the incarnate Logos. Our **analogical knowledge** is secured by his condescension, our rational trust is grounded in his faithfulness, and our defense is not in rhetoric but in the Lord of glory whom we sanctify in our hearts. This posture enables a candidate to answer the examiner’s most pressing question: can you say what you mean when you say that you know God? Yes. We know truly though not comprehensively, because God makes himself known; our terms are analogical, governed by **divine simplicity**; our certainty is covenantal and Spirit-wrought, not bravado; our use of nature is ministerial, not magisterial; and our argument is ultimately a confession, that in God’s light we see light.
