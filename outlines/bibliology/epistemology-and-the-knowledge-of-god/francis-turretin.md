# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin developed a rigorous **Reformed scholastic** approach to **epistemology**, emphasizing the necessity of **revelation** for true **knowledge of God**. He distinguished between **natural** and **supernatural theology**, arguing that while some knowledge of God is accessible through **natural reason**, saving knowledge requires **special revelation** as found in Scripture.

- "The knowledge of God, which is innate in us, is not sufficient for salvation, but must be completed by the doctrine revealed in the Word." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected writings in Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (ed. Richard Muller)
- The Doctrine of Scripture (various sections in Institutes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Natural and Supernatural Theology**
    - Affirms that **natural theology** provides a general, though limited, knowledge of God through creation.
    - **Supernatural theology** (special revelation) is necessary for salvific knowledge.
    - Natural reason is affected by the fall and cannot attain redemptive truth unaided.
    - The **light of nature** is sufficient for accountability but not for salvation.
    - "Natural theology, although it teaches that there is a God, does not teach what kind of God he is in respect to grace and mercy." (Institutes)

2. **Necessity and Sufficiency of Revelation**
    - **Scripture** is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of the knowledge of God.
    - Revelation is necessary due to the **noetic effects of sin**.
    - The **clarity** and **authority** of Scripture are foundational for true knowledge.
    - Human reason must be subordinated to divine revelation in theological matters.
    - "The Scriptures alone are the foundation of our faith and the rule of our knowledge of God." (Institutes)

3. **Analogical Knowledge of God**
    - Human knowledge of God is **analogical**, not univocal or equivocal.
    - God accommodates his revelation to human capacity.
    - There is a real, though limited, correspondence between divine and human knowledge.
    - The **incomprehensibility of God** does not preclude true knowledge.
    - "We know God not as he is in himself, but as he reveals himself to us." (Institutes)

4. **Role of Faith and Reason**
    - Faith is not irrational but is grounded in the **objective truth** of revelation.
    - Reason serves as a minister, not a master, in theology.
    - The **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** is necessary for certainty.
    - Faith involves assent to revealed truths beyond the reach of unaided reason.
    - "Faith rests not on human reason, but on the testimony of God who cannot lie." (Institutes)

5. **Certainty and Assurance in Knowledge of God**
    - True knowledge of God is accompanied by **certainty**, not mere opinion.
    - Certainty is rooted in the **divine authority** of revelation.
    - Assurance is possible through the Spirit's work and the clarity of Scripture.
    - Doubt is incompatible with the nature of saving faith.
    - "Certainty is founded on the infallible truth of God speaking in Scripture." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s epistemology shaped the **Reformed orthodox** tradition, providing a systematic defense of the necessity and sufficiency of **special revelation** for the knowledge of God. His careful distinctions between **natural and supernatural theology** influenced later Reformed theologians, including those at Westminster. Turretin’s emphasis on the **analogy of knowledge** and the authority of Scripture remains foundational in Reformed discussions of epistemology and the doctrine of God.
