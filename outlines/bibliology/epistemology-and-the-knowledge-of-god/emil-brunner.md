# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner’s epistemology centers on the conviction that **knowledge of God** is possible only through a personal, existential encounter initiated by God Himself. Rejecting both rationalism and pure subjectivism, Brunner emphasizes the necessity of **divine revelation** and the role of **faith** in true knowledge, while maintaining a sharp distinction between **general** and **special revelation**. He is known for his "eristics"—the idea that human reason is both enabled and limited by the **imago Dei** and the effects of the **Fall**.

- "God can be known only where He Himself has spoken and speaks, where He Himself gives Himself to be known." (Revelation and Reason)

## Key Works

- Revelation and Reason (1931)
- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- The Christian Doctrine of God (1946)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)
- Man in Revolt (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Personal Encounter**
    - Knowledge of God arises from a direct, personal encounter, not abstract propositions.
    - Revelation is God’s self-disclosure, not merely communication of facts.
    - Human response in faith is essential to genuine knowledge of God.
    - Revelation is always relational, involving both God and the human subject.
    - "Revelation is not the imparting of information, but the imparting of Himself." (Revelation and Reason)

2. **Distinction Between General and Special Revelation**
    - General revelation provides a basis for human awareness of God but is insufficient for salvation.
    - Special revelation, centered in Christ, is necessary for redemptive knowledge.
    - The effects of sin distort general revelation, necessitating special revelation.
    - The two forms of revelation are related but not identical in content or effect.
    - "General revelation is always ambiguous; only in Christ is God fully known." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

3. **Role and Limits of Reason**
    - Human reason is a gift of God but is limited by sin.
    - Reason can apprehend but not comprehend God’s self-revelation.
    - Rational proofs for God are inadequate apart from revelation.
    - Faith and reason are distinct but not opposed; faith transcends reason.
    - "Faith is not irrational, but it is supra-rational." (Revelation and Reason)

4. **Imago Dei and the Possibility of Knowledge**
    - Humans retain the image of God, enabling a capacity for relationship and knowledge.
    - The imago Dei is marred but not destroyed by the Fall.
    - This image grounds the possibility of communication between God and humanity.
    - Even in sin, humans are addressed by God and capable of response.
    - "The image of God in man is the presupposition of revelation." (Man in Revolt)

5. **Truth as Encounter**
    - Truth is not a static set of propositions but a dynamic event.
    - The knowledge of God is existential, involving the whole person.
    - Objective truth is encountered subjectively in the act of faith.
    - The Word of God is both event and message, not merely doctrine.
    - "Truth happens to us as an encounter." (Truth as Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s emphasis on **revelation as encounter** shaped 20th-century Protestant thought, especially in the context of **dialectical theology**. His nuanced distinction between general and special revelation influenced debates on **natural theology** and the limits of human reason. Though often contrasted with Karl Barth, Brunner’s work remains significant for discussions on the relationship between **faith and knowledge**, and the existential dimensions of knowing God. His legacy endures in both systematic theology and ecumenical dialogue.
