# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth revolutionized modern Christian **epistemology** by asserting that all true **knowledge of God** depends entirely on God's sovereign **self-revelation** in Jesus Christ, rather than on human reason or natural theology. For Barth, genuine **revelation** is a dynamic event initiated by God, mediated through the **Word of God**—in Christ, Scripture, and proclamation—and received by faith through the work of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "God is known only by God, and only through God’s own self-unveiling." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Karl Barth: A Biography (Eberhard Busch)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Only Source of Knowledge of God**
   - Human beings cannot attain knowledge of God through autonomous reason or observation.
   - God freely chooses to reveal himself in Jesus Christ.
   - Revelation is an event, not a static deposit of information.
   - All true knowledge of God is grounded in God’s initiative, not human discovery.
   "God reveals Himself. He reveals Himself through Himself. He reveals Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Rejection of Natural Theology**
   - Barth opposes any attempt to know God apart from revelation in Christ.
   - He critiques the analogia entis (analogy of being) as a basis for theology.
   - Human concepts and experiences cannot bridge the gap to divine reality.
   - The knowledge of God is not continuous with general human knowledge.
   "There is no such thing as a right road from man to God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **The Word of God as Threefold Form**
   - The Word of God is revealed as Jesus Christ (the Word incarnate).
   - Scripture is the witness to God’s revelation.
   - Proclamation (preaching) is the contemporary form of the Word.
   - All three forms are united by the action of the Holy Spirit.
   "The Word of God is God Himself in His revelation." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

4. **Faith as the Response to Revelation**
   - Knowledge of God is a gift received by faith, not achieved by effort.
   - Faith is created by the Holy Spirit in response to God’s self-disclosure.
   - Faith involves personal encounter, not mere assent to propositions.
   - The act of faith is inseparable from the event of revelation.
   "Faith is the gift of the meeting in which God gives Himself to be known." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

5. **Christocentric Epistemology**
   - Jesus Christ is the sole mediator and content of divine revelation.
   - All knowledge of God is measured by conformity to Christ.
   - Christ is both the Revealer and the Revelation.
   - The doctrine of election is grounded in Christ as the electing God and elected man.
   "In Jesus Christ God reveals Himself as the One who loves in freedom." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s **revelation-centered epistemology** decisively shaped twentieth-century theology, challenging both liberal Protestant reliance on experience and Roman Catholic natural theology. His insistence on the primacy of **God’s self-revelation** in Christ redirected theological method and remains foundational for much of contemporary Reformed and ecumenical theology. Barth’s critique of autonomous reason continues to provoke debate about the relationship between faith and reason, and his influence endures in discussions of **theology proper** and the doctrine of Scripture.
