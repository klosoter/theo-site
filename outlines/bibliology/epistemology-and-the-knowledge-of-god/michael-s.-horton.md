# Michael S. Horton (1964– )

Michael S. Horton approaches **epistemology** and the **knowledge of God** from a distinctly **Reformed** and **covenantal** perspective, emphasizing the priority of **divine revelation** over human speculation. He insists that true knowledge of God is possible only through God's **self-disclosure** in **Scripture** and in the person of **Jesus Christ**, rejecting both rationalist and subjectivist approaches that bypass revelation.

- "God is known only as he gives himself to be known, and this self-giving is covenantal, not speculative or autonomous." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way
- Covenant and Eschatology: The Divine Drama
- Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples
- People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology
- Introducing Covenant Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Covenantal and Christocentric**
    - God reveals himself through **covenant history**, culminating in Christ.
    - Knowledge of God is always mediated by God's **initiative** and promise.
    - Revelation is not merely propositional but relational and redemptive.
    - Christ is the ultimate self-revelation of God, the center of all knowledge of God.
    - "God’s revelation is not a set of timeless truths, but the unfolding of his covenantal drama in history." (Covenant and Eschatology)

2. **Scripture as the Norming Norm**
    - **Scripture** is the supreme authority for knowing God, above tradition or experience.
    - The Bible is both the source and standard for all theological knowledge.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are essential for epistemology.
    - The Holy Spirit illumines Scripture, enabling true knowledge of God.
    - "Scripture is not simply a record of revelation but is itself the living voice of God." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Rejection of Autonomy in Human Reason**
    - Human reason is fallen and cannot attain knowledge of God independently.
    - All attempts at autonomous theology are forms of idolatry.
    - Faith seeks understanding, but reason is always subordinate to revelation.
    - True knowledge requires humility and dependence on God’s self-disclosure.
    - "The quest for autonomous reason is the original sin of theology." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Knowledge of God is Redemptive and Relational**
    - Knowing God is inseparable from being reconciled to him in Christ.
    - The knowledge of God is not abstract but personal and covenantal.
    - Faith is a gift, not a human achievement or discovery.
    - The church is the context in which knowledge of God is nurtured and sustained.
    - "To know God is to be known by him, to be drawn into his saving fellowship." (Pilgrim Theology)

5. **The Role of the Holy Spirit in Epistemology**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables and authenticates true knowledge of God.
    - Illumination is necessary due to human sin and finitude.
    - The Spirit applies the Word, making it effective in the hearts of believers.
    - Assurance of knowledge is grounded in the Spirit’s witness, not subjective feeling.
    - "Without the Spirit, the Word remains a closed book and God an unknown stranger." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Horton has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed epistemology** by emphasizing the primacy of **revelation** and the necessity of the **covenant** framework for understanding the knowledge of God. His work has reinforced the centrality of **Scripture** and the **Holy Spirit** in theological method, challenging both liberal and fundamentalist approaches. Through his writings and teaching, Horton has influenced pastors, scholars, and laypeople to ground their knowledge of God in the drama of redemption rather than in speculative philosophy.
