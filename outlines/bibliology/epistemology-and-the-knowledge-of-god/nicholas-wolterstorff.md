# Nicholas Wolterstorff (1932–)

Nicholas Wolterstorff is a leading figure in **Reformed epistemology**, advocating that **belief in God** can be **properly basic** and rational apart from inferential evidence. He challenges classical foundationalism, emphasizing the role of **faith, community, and practices** in shaping **knowledge of God**. Wolterstorff’s approach integrates **philosophical rigor** with a commitment to the authority of **Scripture** and the lived experience of the Christian community.

- "It is entirely proper, rational, and warranted for one to accept belief in God without evidence or argument." (Reason within the Bounds of Religion)

## Key Works

- Reason within the Bounds of Religion (1976)
- Divine Discourse: Philosophical Reflections on the Claim that God Speaks (1995)
- Thomas Reid and the Story of Epistemology (2001)
- Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God (co-edited with Alvin Plantinga, 1983)
- Practices of Belief: Selected Essays (2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Classical Foundationalism**
    - Argues that classical foundationalism sets unjustifiably strict criteria for rational belief.
    - Maintains that many beliefs, including **belief in God**, are rational without inferential evidence.
    - Draws on the epistemology of Thomas Reid to support direct knowledge.
    - Sees foundationalism as incompatible with the lived reality of religious faith.
    - "Classical foundationalism is itself not properly basic and cannot meet its own standards." (Reason within the Bounds of Religion)

2. **Properly Basic Beliefs**
    - Asserts that **belief in God** can be properly basic, not needing inferential justification.
    - Proper basicality is determined by the context of **rational practices** and communities.
    - Emphasizes that religious experience can ground basic beliefs.
    - Challenges the idea that only self-evident or incorrigible beliefs are properly basic.
    - "It is entirely proper, rational, and warranted for one to accept belief in God without evidence or argument." (Reason within the Bounds of Religion)

3. **Role of Community and Practice**
    - Knowledge is shaped by the practices and traditions of a believing community.
    - Rationality is not abstract but embedded in communal life and liturgy.
    - The church’s practices form a context for recognizing **divine revelation**.
    - Emphasizes the formative power of **Scripture** within the community.
    - "Rationality is a social practice, not a set of timeless rules." (Reason within the Bounds of Religion)

4. **Divine Discourse and Revelation**
    - God genuinely speaks and communicates through **Scripture**.
    - Human language is a suitable medium for divine self-disclosure.
    - The act of God speaking is not reducible to human interpretation alone.
    - Emphasizes the **authority of Scripture** as divine discourse.
    - "God speaks, and Scripture is the principal medium of that speech." (Divine Discourse)

5. **Integration of Faith and Reason**
    - Faith and reason are not adversaries but mutually informing.
    - Rational reflection is a legitimate part of Christian faith.
    - Theological claims can be subject to philosophical analysis without undermining faith.
    - Openness to critique and dialogue with broader philosophical traditions.
    - "Faith seeks understanding, and understanding deepens faith." (Reason within the Bounds of Religion)

## Legacy and Impact

Wolterstorff’s work has profoundly shaped **Reformed epistemology**, especially through his defense of **properly basic beliefs** and critique of foundationalism. His emphasis on the communal and practice-oriented nature of knowledge has influenced both philosophy of religion and theological method. By insisting on the rationality of **belief in God** apart from evidentialist demands, he has provided a robust framework for Christian intellectual engagement in the modern academy. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of **religious knowledge** and the authority of **Scripture**.
