# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached **epistemology** and the **knowledge of God** through the lens of **Reformed revelation**, emphasizing the necessity of **special revelation** for true knowledge of God due to the effects of **sin** on human cognition. He maintained that **Scripture** is the divinely ordained medium through which God makes Himself known, and that all human knowledge of God is **covenantally** and **redemptively** conditioned.

- "Revelation is the communication of knowledge by God to man, which knowledge man could not otherwise have possessed." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics (especially Vol. 1: Theology Proper)
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "The Doctrine of Revelation in the History of Dogma" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)
- "The Self-Disclosure of Jesus" (in The Self-Disclosure of Jesus)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Redemptive-Historical**
    - God’s self-disclosure unfolds progressively within the history of redemption.
    - The knowledge of God is inseparable from His acts in history.
    - Revelation is not merely propositional but is embedded in God’s redemptive work.
    - The unity of revelation is centered in Christ as the culmination.
    - "Revelation is as much an act as it is a word." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Necessity of Special Revelation**
    - Human sin renders general revelation insufficient for salvific knowledge.
    - Special revelation is required for a true and saving knowledge of God.
    - Scripture is the normative and authoritative form of special revelation.
    - The Spirit enables the reception and understanding of this revelation.
    - "The necessity of special revelation arises from the fact that sin has darkened the mind of man." (Reformed Dogmatics)

3. **Covenantal Context of Knowledge**
    - Knowledge of God is always situated within the framework of the covenant.
    - The covenant relationship defines the possibility and character of knowing God.
    - God’s self-revelation is always personal and relational, not abstract.
    - The knowledge of God is both given and sustained by God Himself.
    - "All revelation is covenantal in character." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Organic Inspiration of Scripture**
    - Scripture is the product of divine and human agency, organically united.
    - The Bible’s authority rests on its divine origin and inspiration.
    - The unity and diversity of Scripture reflect God’s sovereign purpose.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures the reliability and clarity of revelation.
    - "The inspiration of Scripture is organic, not mechanical." (Reformed Dogmatics)

5. **Faith as the Means of Knowledge**
    - True knowledge of God is possible only through faith.
    - Faith is itself a gift of God, produced by the Spirit through the Word.
    - Faith involves both intellectual assent and personal trust in God’s revelation.
    - The epistemic posture of faith is necessary due to human finitude and sin.
    - "Faith is the organ for the appropriation of revelation." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s approach to **epistemology** profoundly shaped the development of **Reformed biblical theology**, emphasizing the redemptive-historical and covenantal dimensions of knowing God. His insistence on the necessity of **special revelation** and the organic unity of Scripture has influenced generations of theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. Vos’s work continues to serve as a foundational resource for understanding the relationship between revelation, faith, and the knowledge of God in a thoroughly Reformed framework.
