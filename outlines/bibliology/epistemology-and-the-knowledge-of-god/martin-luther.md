# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s approach to **epistemology** and the **knowledge of God** centers on the radical incapacity of fallen human reason to attain true knowledge of God apart from **divine revelation**. He insists that genuine knowledge of God comes only through **Scripture** and is received by **faith**, not by speculative philosophy or human works. For Luther, the **hiddenness of God** and the necessity of **theologia crucis** (theology of the cross) are central to understanding how God makes Himself known.

- "For apart from the Word and outside Christ, God is not known, nor can He be comprehended." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Lectures on Romans (1515–1516)
- Lectures on Genesis (1535–1545)
- Luther’s Prefaces to the Bible

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Knowledge of God is through Revelation Alone**
    - Human reason is fundamentally incapable of ascending to God on its own.
    - God must reveal Himself, primarily through **Scripture** and ultimately in **Christ**.
    - Natural theology is insufficient and often leads to idolatry or misunderstanding.
    - The **Word of God** is the only sure and certain source of divine knowledge.
    - "God in His own nature and majesty is to be left alone; in this regard, we have nothing to do with Him." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Theology of the Cross versus Theology of Glory**
    - True knowledge of God comes through the revelation of the cross, not human speculation.
    - The **theologia crucis** exposes the limits and failures of human wisdom.
    - God reveals Himself in weakness, suffering, and apparent foolishness.
    - The cross is the lens through which all knowledge of God must be interpreted.
    - "He deserves to be called a theologian... who comprehends the visible and manifest things of God seen through suffering and the cross." (Heidelberg Disputation)

3. **Faith as the Means of Knowing God**
    - **Faith** is the only proper response to God’s self-revelation.
    - Knowledge of God is personal, relational, and grounded in trust, not mere intellectual assent.
    - Faith is created and sustained by the Holy Spirit through the Word.
    - Certainty in knowledge of God comes from faith, not from rational demonstration.
    - "Faith is a living, daring confidence in God’s grace, so sure and certain that a man would stake his life on it a thousand times." (Preface to Romans)

4. **Scripture as the Norming Norm**
    - **Scripture** is the ultimate authority and the clear revelation of God’s will and character.
    - All theological claims must be tested by the plain sense of Scripture.
    - The clarity (perspicuity) of Scripture ensures that God’s revelation is accessible to all believers.
    - Human traditions and ecclesiastical authorities are subordinate to the Word.
    - "The true rule is this: God’s Word shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel can do so." (Smalcald Articles)

5. **Hiddenness and Revealedness of God**
    - God is both **Deus absconditus** (hidden God) and **Deus revelatus** (revealed God).
    - God’s essence remains incomprehensible apart from His self-disclosure.
    - The hiddenness of God humbles human pride and prevents presumption.
    - We encounter God as He chooses to reveal Himself, especially in Christ and the gospel.
    - "We know God only as He has made Himself known in Christ, not as He is in His hidden majesty." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s emphasis on **revelation**, **faith**, and the **theology of the cross** reshaped Protestant approaches to epistemology and the knowledge of God. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the limits of human reason profoundly influenced later Reformed and Lutheran theology. Luther’s distinction between the hidden and revealed God continues to inform discussions on divine mystery and the accessibility of God’s self-disclosure. His legacy endures in the ongoing Protestant commitment to sola scriptura and the centrality of Christ in knowing God.
