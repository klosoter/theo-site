# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached **epistemology** and the **knowledge of God** from a robustly **Reformed** and **presuppositional** standpoint, emphasizing the necessity of **revelation** for true knowledge. He maintained that human beings, as created in the **image of God**, possess an innate capacity for knowledge, but that **saving knowledge** of God is only possible through the **self-disclosure** of God in Scripture and by the work of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "The knowledge of God is not attained by human discovery but is given by divine self-disclosure." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT Commentary)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "Principles of Conduct"
- "The Nature of Faith" (essay)
- "Christian Baptism" (for his treatment of covenant and knowledge)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Foundation of Knowledge**
    - True knowledge of God depends entirely on God's **self-revelation**.
    - **General revelation** renders all people without excuse, but is insufficient for salvation.
    - **Special revelation** in Scripture is necessary for redemptive knowledge.
    - Revelation is both propositional and personal, involving God's acts and words.
    - "Revelation is the prerequisite of all knowledge of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **The Noetic Effects of Sin**
    - The fall has corrupted human faculties, including reason and perception.
    - Sin leads to the suppression of the truth revealed in creation.
    - Apart from grace, humans distort and reject true knowledge of God.
    - Regeneration is required to overcome this epistemic depravity.
    - "Sin affects the whole man, including his mind and understanding." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **The Necessity of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit enables the apprehension and acceptance of divine truth.
    - Illumination is essential for understanding Scripture rightly.
    - The Spirit applies the objective revelation subjectively to the believer.
    - Knowledge of God is thus both objective (revealed) and subjective (applied).
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who takes of the things of Christ and shows them unto us." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Covenantal Context of Knowledge**
    - Knowledge of God is always situated within the context of the **covenant**.
    - The covenant relationship grounds both the possibility and the content of knowing God.
    - The promises and commands of God are revealed within covenantal history.
    - Faithful knowledge is relational, not merely intellectual assent.
    - "The knowledge of God is covenantal in character." (Principles of Conduct)

5. **Objective and Subjective Dimensions of Faith**
    - Faith involves assent to revealed truth and personal trust in God.
    - Knowledge, assent, and trust are inseparable in true faith.
    - Saving knowledge is not mere cognition but involves the whole person.
    - The objectivity of revelation calls for a subjective response of faith.
    - "Faith is knowledge passing into conviction, and it is conviction passing into confidence." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of **revelation** and the **noetic effects of sin** has shaped Reformed epistemology, especially in emphasizing the necessity of **special revelation** and the work of the **Holy Spirit** for true knowledge of God. His covenantal approach to knowledge continues to influence contemporary discussions on the relationship between faith and reason. Murray’s careful exegesis and theological precision have made his writings foundational for students and pastors seeking to understand the epistemological implications of Reformed theology.
