# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame’s epistemology centers on the **covenantal relationship** between God and humanity, emphasizing that all knowledge of God is possible only through **divine revelation**. He is known for his **triperspectivalism**, which asserts that knowledge involves the interplay of the **normative, situational, and existential perspectives**, and he insists that **Scripture** is the ultimate standard for all human thought.

- "The knowledge of God is the most basic knowledge that we have, the presupposition of all our other knowledge." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought (1995)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Apologetics to the Glory of God (1994)
- A History of Western Philosophy and Theology (2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Knowledge is Covenantal**
    - Human knowledge of God is always personal and covenantal, not abstract or impersonal.
    - God initiates knowledge through **revelation**; humans are always responders.
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** shapes all epistemological questions.
    - All knowledge is ultimately dependent on God’s self-disclosure.
    - "Knowledge is a relationship between a subject and an object under the lordship of God." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

2. **Triperspectivalism in Epistemology**
    - Knowledge involves the **normative** (God’s standards), **situational** (facts of the world), and **existential** (knower’s self) perspectives.
    - Each perspective is interdependent and necessary for a full account of knowledge.
    - No single perspective is sufficient; all three must be integrated.
    - This model reflects the **Trinitarian** nature of reality and knowledge.
    - "Every act of knowing involves a subject, an object, and a standard." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

3. **Primacy of Divine Revelation**
    - **Scripture** is the ultimate authority and criterion for all knowledge.
    - General and special revelation are both necessary, but Scripture interprets all reality.
    - Human reason is subordinate to God’s revealed Word.
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables true knowledge of God.
    - "God’s revelation is the foundation of all human knowledge." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

4. **Antithesis and Common Grace**
    - There is a fundamental **antithesis** between Christian and non-Christian epistemologies.
    - Unbelievers suppress the truth in unrighteousness, yet can know things due to **common grace**.
    - All people have knowledge of God, but only believers acknowledge Him rightly.
    - Apologetics must account for both the clarity and suppression of God’s revelation.
    - "Unbelievers know God, but they suppress that knowledge." (Apologetics to the Glory of God)

5. **Integration of Faith and Reason**
    - Faith is not opposed to reason; rather, faith is the context for all true reasoning.
    - Rationality is possible only within the framework of **biblical theism**.
    - The autonomy of human reason is rejected; all thought is to be captive to Christ.
    - The Christian worldview provides the only coherent basis for knowledge.
    - "Faith governs reason, not the other way around." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s **triperspectivalism** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed epistemology, especially within the Westminster tradition. His emphasis on the **covenantal nature of knowledge** and the centrality of **Scripture** as epistemic authority has influenced generations of theologians and apologists. Frame’s work continues to provide a robust framework for integrating theology, philosophy, and apologetics in the pursuit of the knowledge of God.
