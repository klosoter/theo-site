# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher revolutionized **epistemology** in theology by grounding the **knowledge of God** in the immediate **feeling of absolute dependence** rather than in rational proofs or external revelation. He emphasized the subjective, experiential dimension of **religious consciousness**, arguing that all theological knowledge arises from the self-consciousness of the believer in relation to the divine.

- "Religion’s essence is neither thinking nor acting, but intuition and feeling." (On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers)

## Key Works

- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers (1799)
- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube) (1821–22, 2nd ed. 1830–31)
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology (Kurze Darstellung des theologischen Studiums) (1811)
- Schleiermacher: Between Enlightenment and Romanticism (Richard Crouter, ed.)
- Schleiermacher: Hermeneutics and Criticism (Andrew Bowie, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Feeling**
    - The foundation of **religious knowledge** is the immediate feeling of absolute dependence.
    - This feeling is pre-reflective and precedes doctrinal or ethical formulations.
    - Knowledge of God is not mediated by rational argument but by lived experience.
    - All theology must begin with the analysis of religious self-consciousness.
    - "The essence of piety is the feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Rationalist and Empiricist Foundations**
    - Schleiermacher critiques both rationalist proofs and empiricist evidences for God.
    - He sees **revelation** as internal, not external or propositional.
    - Reason and experience serve to articulate, not ground, religious knowledge.
    - Theological epistemology is thus distinct from philosophical epistemology.
    - "Faith is not derived from knowledge, but knowledge from faith." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Mediation of Knowledge through Community**
    - The **church** is the bearer and interpreter of religious experience.
    - Individual knowledge of God is shaped by participation in the Christian community.
    - Doctrine arises from the communal reflection on shared religious feeling.
    - The **creeds** and confessions are secondary expressions of primary experience.
    - "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Hermeneutical Approach to Scripture**
    - Scripture is authoritative as the record of the earliest Christian experience.
    - Understanding the Bible requires empathetic engagement with its religious consciousness.
    - Interpretation is always conditioned by the interpreter’s own context and feeling.
    - The Bible’s authority is derivative, not foundational, for knowledge of God.
    - "Scripture is the original document of the religious self-consciousness of the Church." (The Christian Faith)

5. **God as the Whence of Consciousness**
    - God is not an object among others but the presupposition of all consciousness.
    - The knowledge of God is indirect, mediated through the sense of dependence.
    - God is the infinite, the unconditioned ground of all finite existence.
    - Theological statements are symbolic expressions of this relationship.
    - "God is the whence of our self-consciousness, the presupposition of all that we are." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s **epistemology** marked a decisive turn toward the **subjective** and experiential in modern theology, influencing later developments in **liberal Protestantism** and existential theology. His focus on **religious feeling** as the locus of the knowledge of God challenged both traditional dogmatics and Enlightenment rationalism. While criticized by confessional theologians for undermining objective revelation, his work remains foundational for discussions of **religious experience** and hermeneutics in contemporary theology.
