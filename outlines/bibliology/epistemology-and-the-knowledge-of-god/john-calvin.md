# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin grounds **epistemology** and the **knowledge of God** in the innate **sensus divinitatis** and the self-authenticating nature of **Scripture**. He insists that true knowledge of God is both **natural** and **special**, but only through the **illumination of the Holy Spirit** can fallen humans apprehend God rightly.

- "There is within the human mind, and indeed by natural instinct, an awareness of divinity." (Institutes I.3.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I)
- Commentary on Romans
- Commentary on Genesis
- Sermons on Job
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sensus Divinitatis**
   - All humans possess an innate sense of the divine.
   - This sense is universal and inescapable, though often suppressed.
   - It provides a natural awareness of God’s existence and attributes.
   - Sin distorts and obscures this natural knowledge.
   - "That there exists in the human mind and indeed by natural instinct, some sense of Deity, we hold to be beyond dispute." (Institutes I.3.1)

2. **Necessity of Special Revelation**
   - Natural revelation is insufficient for saving knowledge of God.
   - Scripture is necessary to know God as Redeemer.
   - The clarity and authority of Scripture surpass all human reasoning.
   - God accommodates Himself to human capacity in Scripture.
   - "For, as a garment is to the body, so the Word is to God: by it he is covered, and in a manner made visible to us." (Institutes I.6.1)

3. **Self-Authentication of Scripture**
   - Scripture bears its own authority, independent of human approval.
   - The Holy Spirit testifies internally to the truth of Scripture.
   - Faith is not based on rational proofs but on the Spirit’s witness.
   - The church recognizes, but does not confer, Scripture’s authority.
   - "Scripture exhibits fully as clear evidence of its own truth as white and black things do of their color, or sweet and bitter things do of their taste." (Institutes I.7.2)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Knowledge**
   - The Spirit illumines the mind to understand and accept divine truth.
   - Without the Spirit, human reason is blind to spiritual realities.
   - The Spirit’s work is necessary for both understanding and assurance.
   - Knowledge of God is relational, not merely intellectual.
   - "The testimony of the Spirit is more excellent than all reason." (Institutes I.7.4)

5. **Relationship Between Knowledge of God and Self-Knowledge**
   - True knowledge of God leads to true knowledge of self, and vice versa.
   - Human depravity is revealed in light of God’s holiness.
   - Self-knowledge drives one to seek God’s grace.
   - The two forms of knowledge are inseparably linked in Calvin’s thought.
   - "Without knowledge of self there is no knowledge of God…without knowledge of God there is no knowledge of self." (Institutes I.1.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of the **sensus divinitatis** and his emphasis on the **self-authenticating authority of Scripture** have profoundly shaped Reformed epistemology. His insights influenced later theologians such as Bavinck and Van Til, and continue to inform debates on **natural theology** and the role of **revelation**. Calvin’s integration of epistemology with the doctrines of revelation and the Holy Spirit remains foundational for Reformed approaches to the knowledge of God.
