# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a comprehensive **epistemology** rooted in both **natural reason** and **divine revelation**, arguing that human beings can attain true knowledge of God through the use of **philosophical reason** (via natural theology) and, more fully, through **supernatural revelation**. He maintained that while the **existence of God** can be known by reason, the **essence of God** and the mysteries of faith require **revelation**.

- "We cannot know what God is, but only what He is not; we must therefore consider the ways in which God does not exist, rather than the ways in which He does." (Summa Theologiae I, q.3, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I, qq. 1–13)
- Summa Contra Gentiles (Book I)
- De Veritate (On Truth)
- Commentary on Boethius’s De Trinitate
- De Potentia Dei

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Natural and Supernatural Knowledge**
    - Human reason can attain **natural knowledge** of God through observation of the created order.
    - **Supernatural knowledge** (e.g., the Trinity) is accessible only through **divine revelation**.
    - Natural theology demonstrates God's existence and attributes, but not His inner life.
    - The distinction safeguards both the integrity of reason and the necessity of faith.
    - "Some truths about God exceed all the ability of the human reason." (Summa Contra Gentiles I.5)

2. **Analogy of Being (Analogia Entis)**
    - Human language about God is neither purely univocal nor equivocal, but **analogical**.
    - Analogy allows for meaningful yet limited predication of attributes to God.
    - This preserves both divine transcendence and the possibility of true knowledge.
    - The analogia entis is central to Aquinas’s account of theological language.
    - "We cannot know what God is, but only what He is not." (Summa Theologiae I, q.3, a.1)

3. **Primacy of the Intellect in Knowledge**
    - The **intellect** is the primary faculty by which humans apprehend truth.
    - Knowledge begins in the senses but is perfected in the intellect’s abstraction of universals.
    - The intellect is ordered toward truth, which finds its ultimate source in God.
    - Faith perfects reason but does not destroy or bypass it.
    - "To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible." (Summa Theologiae II-II, q.1, a.4)

4. **Faith and Reason are Distinct but Harmonious**
    - **Faith** and **reason** are distinct sources of knowledge, but both originate from God.
    - There can be no real contradiction between truths of faith and truths of reason.
    - Reason prepares for faith and can defend it, but cannot replace revelation.
    - The harmony of faith and reason is a hallmark of Aquinas’s epistemology.
    - "Since faith rests upon infallible truth, and since the contrary of a truth can never be demonstrated, it is clear that the articles of faith cannot be demonstrated." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.8)

5. **Limits of Human Knowledge of God**
    - Humans can know that God exists, but not comprehend His **essence**.
    - All knowledge of God in this life is indirect, mediated by effects or analogies.
    - The **beatific vision** is the only state in which God is known directly.
    - This epistemic humility guards against rationalism and presumption.
    - "We know that God is, but not what He is." (Summa Theologiae I, q.12, a.13)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s epistemology profoundly shaped **Western Christian thought**, providing the foundation for later discussions of **natural theology** and the relationship between **faith and reason**. His careful distinctions and use of **analogy** influenced both Catholic and Protestant traditions, even among those who critiqued his synthesis. Aquinas remains a central figure in debates over the possibility and limits of human knowledge of God.
