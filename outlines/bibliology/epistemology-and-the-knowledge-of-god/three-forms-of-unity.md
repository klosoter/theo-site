# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust **Reformed epistemology** grounded in the conviction that **God’s self-revelation** is both necessary and sufficient for true knowledge of God. They emphasize the **clarity of Scripture**, the **inadequacy of natural revelation for salvation**, and the **Spirit’s internal witness** as essential for genuine faith and understanding. This framework insists that all human knowledge of God is dependent upon God’s gracious initiative in **revelation**.

- "We know him by two means: First, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe... Second, he makes himself more clearly and fully known to us by his holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 2–7
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 19–21, 26
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. First Head, Articles 3–7
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Background (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism: A Reformation Synthesis (Lyle D. Bierma)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Knowledge is Incomprehensible Yet Knowable**
   - God’s essence is ultimately beyond human comprehension.
   - True knowledge of God is possible because God reveals himself.
   - Human knowledge is always analogical and dependent on revelation.
   - The distinction between **archetypal** (God’s) and **ectypal** (creaturely) knowledge is maintained.
   - "We know him in so far as he makes himself known to us." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

2. **Necessity and Sufficiency of Divine Revelation**
   - Natural revelation renders all people inexcusable but cannot lead to saving knowledge.
   - **Scripture** is necessary for a full and saving knowledge of God.
   - The Word of God is clear and sufficient for faith and life.
   - The authority of Scripture is not derived from human approval but from God himself.
   - "God makes himself more clearly and fully known to us by his holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Knowledge**
   - The **Holy Spirit** illumines the mind to understand and receive God’s revelation.
   - Faith is a gift worked by the Spirit through the Word.
   - The Spirit testifies inwardly to the truth and authority of Scripture.
   - Without the Spirit, human reason is blind to spiritual truth.
   - "Faith is not only a certain knowledge... but also a hearty trust, which the Holy Ghost works in me by the gospel." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 21)

4. **Limits of Natural Revelation**
   - Creation reveals God’s existence, power, and providence.
   - This knowledge is sufficient for condemnation, not salvation.
   - Fallen humanity distorts and suppresses natural revelation.
   - Only special revelation in Christ and Scripture leads to reconciliation with God.
   - "By the creation, preservation, and government of the universe... men cannot attain to the saving knowledge of God." (Canons of Dort, I.4)

5. **Certainty of Faith Rooted in God’s Promise**
   - Assurance of knowledge rests on God’s unchanging Word.
   - Faith is grounded in the promises of the gospel, not in human reasoning.
   - The believer’s certainty is anchored in the reliability of God’s revelation.
   - Doubt is overcome by the Spirit’s testimony and the objective truth of Scripture.
   - "This faith the Holy Ghost works in our hearts by the gospel." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 21)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed confessional identity** and the doctrine of the knowledge of God in Protestant theology. Their articulation of **revelation**, the necessity of the **Spirit’s work**, and the sufficiency of **Scripture** continues to influence Reformed churches and theological education worldwide. By grounding epistemology in God’s initiative and the means of grace, they provide a lasting framework for understanding how finite creatures may truly know the infinite God.
