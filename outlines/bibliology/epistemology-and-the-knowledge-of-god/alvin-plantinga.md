# Alvin Plantinga (1932–)

Alvin Plantinga revolutionized contemporary discussions of **Reformed epistemology** by arguing that belief in **God** can be **properly basic**—rational and warranted apart from inferential evidence or argument. He critiques **classical foundationalism** and develops a robust account of **warrant** that grounds **theistic belief** in the proper functioning of cognitive faculties designed by God.

- "If my cognitive faculties are functioning properly in a congenial epistemic environment according to a design plan successfully aimed at truth, then my beliefs have warrant." ("Warranted Christian Belief")

## Key Works

- "Warranted Christian Belief" (2000)
- "Warrant and Proper Function" (1993)
- "God and Other Minds" (1967)
- "Reason and Belief in God" (in "Faith and Rationality," 1983)
- "Knowledge and Christian Belief" (2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Belief in God as Properly Basic**
    - Theistic belief does not require inferential evidence to be rational.
    - Proper basicality is grounded in the operation of cognitive faculties as designed by God.
    - Challenges the evidentialist objection that belief in God is irrational without evidence.
    - Draws on the analogy of belief in other minds and the external world.
    "Belief in God can be rationally accepted as basic, without the support of arguments from other beliefs." ("God and Other Minds")

2. **Warrant as Proper Function**
    - Warrant distinguishes knowledge from mere true belief.
    - A belief is warranted if produced by cognitive faculties functioning properly in the right environment.
    - The design plan must be successfully aimed at truth.
    - Sin can distort cognitive function, affecting warrant.
    "A belief has warrant for a person only if his cognitive faculties are functioning properly, in a cognitive environment that is appropriate for those faculties." ("Warrant and Proper Function")

3. **Critique of Classical Foundationalism**
    - Classical foundationalism sets an unjustifiably high bar for rational belief.
    - Many beliefs we take as rational (e.g., memory, perception) are not inferentially justified.
    - Foundationalism is self-referentially incoherent.
    - Opens the door for the rationality of religious belief.
    "Classical foundationalism is itself not properly basic, and hence, by its own lights, irrational." ("Warranted Christian Belief")

4. **The A/C Model (Aquinas/Calvin Model)**
    - Proposes that humans have a **sensus divinitatis**—an innate sense of the divine.
    - This faculty is designed by God to produce belief in Him under the right conditions.
    - The model explains both the rationality and the widespread nature of theistic belief.
    - The noetic effects of sin can impair the sensus divinitatis.
    "According to the model, God has created us with a faculty, the sensus divinitatis, which in the right circumstances produces in us belief in God." ("Warranted Christian Belief")

5. **Defeaters and the Rationality of Christian Belief**
    - Belief in God can be rational even in the presence of objections, unless a successful defeater is provided.
    - Defeaters can be rebutting (directly challenging the belief) or undercutting (challenging the warrant).
    - The Christian worldview provides resources to answer many defeaters.
    - The internal testimony of the Holy Spirit can override external defeaters.
    "If I have no undefeated defeater for my belief in God, then I am within my epistemic rights in holding it." ("Warranted Christian Belief")

## Legacy and Impact

Plantinga’s work on **Reformed epistemology** has profoundly shaped contemporary philosophy of religion, making the rationality of **theistic belief** a live option in analytic philosophy. His arguments against evidentialism and for the proper basicality of belief in God have influenced both Christian and secular epistemologists. Plantinga’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about **warrant**, religious experience, and the epistemic status of faith.
