# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a **Reformed epistemology** in which **Scripture** stands as the ultimate and infallible source for the **knowledge of God**. He argued for the compatibility of **reason** and **revelation**, while insisting that true understanding of divine truth requires the illumination of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "The Bible is to the theologian what nature is to the man of science." (Systematic Theology)

- Princeton Review articles on theology and epistemology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Primary Source of Knowledge of God**
    - Scripture is the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
    - All theological claims must be tested by the teaching of the Bible.
    - The authority of Scripture is self-authenticating and confirmed by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Natural revelation is real but subordinate to **special revelation**.
    "The Scriptures teach us not only what we are to believe concerning God, but also what God requires of us." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Harmony of Reason and Revelation**
    - Reason is a ministerial, not a magisterial, tool in theology.
    - True reason never contradicts the truths of **revelation**.
    - Human reason is fallen but not destroyed by sin.
    - Theologians must use reason to interpret and systematize biblical data.
    "Reason is not the rule of faith, but the organ by which we receive the evidence that the Bible is the Word of God." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Necessity of the Holy Spirit for True Knowledge**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables the mind to apprehend divine truth.
    - Without regeneration, human understanding remains darkened.
    - The Spirit applies the truth of **Scripture** to the heart.
    - Spiritual illumination is essential for saving knowledge.
    "The inward teaching of the Spirit is necessary to enable us to discern the things freely given to us of God." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Validity of Natural Theology within Limits**
    - Creation reveals certain attributes of God to all people.
    - Natural theology cannot lead to saving knowledge without **Scripture**.
    - The moral law written on the heart is a form of natural revelation.
    - Natural theology is preparatory and subordinate to **special revelation**.
    "The heavens declare the glory of God, but it is only in the Scriptures that we learn that God is love." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Objectivity and Certainty of Theological Knowledge**
    - The knowledge of God is not merely subjective or existential.
    - Doctrines can be known with certainty when grounded in **Scripture**.
    - Faith involves assent to objective truths revealed by God.
    - Theological knowledge is both cognitive and relational.
    "Christianity is a system of doctrines, facts, and principles, revealed by God, and to be received on the authority of God." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s approach to **epistemology** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially through his influence at Princeton Theological Seminary. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the compatibility of faith and reason became hallmarks of Old Princeton theology. While sometimes critiqued for rationalism, his balanced emphasis on the necessity of the **Holy Spirit** and the authority of revelation continues to inform contemporary discussions on the knowledge of God.
