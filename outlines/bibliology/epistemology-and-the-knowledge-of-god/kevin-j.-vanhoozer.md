# Kevin J. Vanhoozer (1957– )

Kevin J. Vanhoozer approaches **epistemology** and the **knowledge of God** through the lens of **theological hermeneutics**, emphasizing the triune God's communicative action in Scripture. He contends that knowledge of God is covenantal, dialogical, and mediated by the **Scriptures** as divine speech acts, requiring the participation of the church in faithful interpretation. Vanhoozer resists both postmodern skepticism and foundationalist certainty, advocating for a **theodramatic** and **canonical** approach to knowing God.

- "To know God is to participate fittingly in the drama of redemption, to play one's part in response to the divine speaking." (The Drama of Doctrine)

- First Theology: God, Scripture & Hermeneutics
- Faith Speaking Understanding: Performing the Drama of Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Knowledge of God is Covenantal and Dialogical**
    - God initiates knowledge through **self-revelation** in history and Scripture.
    - Human knowing is a response to God's communicative action, not autonomous discovery.
    - The relationship is personal, involving trust and obedience as well as cognition.
    - The church, as the covenant community, is the primary context for knowing God.
    - "God makes himself known by speaking and acting in history, inviting human beings into covenantal relationship." (The Drama of Doctrine)

2. **Scripture as Divine Speech Act**
    - The Bible is not merely a record but the ongoing communicative action of God.
    - Meaning arises from the triadic relationship of author, text, and reader, with God as the ultimate author.
    - Interpretation requires discerning the illocutionary force of biblical texts.
    - The Spirit enables the church to rightly hear and respond to God's Word.
    - "Scripture is the means by which God continues to address his people, performing his communicative action." (Is There a Meaning in This Text?)

3. **Canonical-Linguistic Approach**
    - Doctrine arises from the canonical Scriptures as a unified, authoritative whole.
    - The canon provides the normative context for theological reasoning and knowing God.
    - Theological interpretation is shaped by the grammar and logic of the biblical canon.
    - The church's task is to perform the drama of Scripture faithfully in its own context.
    - "The canon is the script for the church’s fitting participation in the drama of redemption." (The Drama of Doctrine)

4. **Theodramatic Participation**
    - Knowledge of God is not static but enacted through participation in the divine drama.
    - Doctrine guides the church in improvising faithfully within the unfolding story of redemption.
    - The believer's epistemic posture is one of active, obedient engagement.
    - The Spirit empowers the church to embody and witness to the truth of God.
    - "Doctrine is direction for discipleship, a map for participating in the drama of redemption." (Faith Speaking Understanding)

5. **Epistemic Humility and Confidence**
    - Rejects both postmodern relativism and Enlightenment foundationalism.
    - Advocates for a chastened confidence rooted in God’s self-communication.
    - Knowledge of God is real but partial, always dependent on grace and the Spirit.
    - The church is called to humility, charity, and boldness in its witness.
    - "We know in part, but we know truly, because God has spoken and continues to speak." (First Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vanhoozer has significantly shaped contemporary **theological hermeneutics** by integrating speech-act theory and canonical interpretation into Reformed epistemology. His emphasis on the **drama of doctrine** and the participatory nature of knowing God has influenced both academic theology and church practice. Vanhoozer’s work challenges the church to recover confidence in Scripture while practicing interpretive humility, making his contributions vital for ongoing discussions about the nature and possibility of the knowledge of God.
