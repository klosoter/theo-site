# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til developed a distinctive **Reformed epistemology** grounded in the necessity of **presuppositions** and the **self-attesting authority of Scripture**. He argued that all human knowledge depends on the **triune God** as the ultimate reference point, and that **autonomous reasoning** leads inevitably to futility. For Van Til, true **knowledge of God** is possible only through **revelation**, and all reasoning must be conducted on the basis of **Christian theistic presuppositions**.

- "The Christian position is that God’s revelation is the source of all human knowledge." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith (especially chapters on knowledge and revelation)
- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Apologetics
- A Survey of Christian Epistemology
- Common Grace and the Gospel

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Foundation of Knowledge**
    - All human knowledge is dependent on **God’s self-revelation** in nature and Scripture.
    - **General revelation** renders all people without excuse, but is insufficient for salvation.
    - **Special revelation** in Scripture is necessary for redemptive knowledge of God.
    - Human reason is not autonomous but must submit to God’s revealed truth.
    - "Revelation is the presupposition of all intelligible human predication." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **The Necessity of Presuppositions**
    - Every worldview is built on basic, non-negotiable **presuppositions**.
    - The Christian must presuppose the **truth of the triune God** and His Word.
    - Neutrality in reasoning is impossible; all thought is covenantally committed.
    - Non-Christian presuppositions ultimately lead to epistemological failure.
    - "There is no such thing as epistemological neutrality." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **The Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God is the ultimate source and standard of all knowledge; humans are finite and dependent.
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** is fundamental to a proper epistemology.
    - Human knowledge is analogical, not univocal or equivocal, to God’s knowledge.
    - Denial of this distinction leads to either rationalism or skepticism.
    - "We must think God’s thoughts after Him, though always in a creaturely manner." (A Survey of Christian Epistemology)

4. **Antithesis Between Belief and Unbelief**
    - There is a fundamental **antithesis** between Christian and non-Christian thought.
    - Unbelievers suppress the truth in unrighteousness, distorting knowledge of God.
    - Apologetics must expose the futility of non-Christian epistemologies.
    - Only by regeneration can one truly know God as He is revealed.
    - "There is no common ground except that which is provided by God Himself." (Christian Apologetics)

5. **The Self-Attesting Christ of Scripture**
    - **Scripture** is self-authenticating and the ultimate criterion for truth.
    - The authority of Christ and His Word cannot be grounded in anything outside itself.
    - The Holy Spirit enables believers to recognize the self-attesting nature of revelation.
    - All reasoning must begin and end with the **self-attesting Christ** as revealed in Scripture.
    - "The Bible is authoritative on everything of which it speaks, and it speaks of everything." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s **presuppositional apologetics** has profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to epistemology and the knowledge of God. His insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the necessity of **revelation** has influenced generations of theologians and apologists, especially within the Westminster tradition. While his approach has been critiqued for its perceived circularity, it remains a foundational paradigm for those emphasizing the lordship of Christ over all thought. Van Til’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between faith, reason, and the possibility of true knowledge of God.
