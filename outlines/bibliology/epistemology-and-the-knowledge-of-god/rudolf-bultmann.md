# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann’s approach to **epistemology and the knowledge of God** centers on the existential encounter with the divine through **revelation** rather than through objective or historical proofs. He famously advocated for **demythologization**, insisting that the **kerygma** of the New Testament must be interpreted in existential terms, accessible only through **faith** and not through empirical or rational means. For Bultmann, genuine knowledge of God is inseparable from personal decision and existential transformation.

- "It is not the world-view of the New Testament which is the word of God, but the kerygma in the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)
- Existence and Faith (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization as Hermeneutical Principle**
    - The biblical text must be interpreted apart from its mythological worldview.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind biblical narratives.
    - The aim is to make the **kerygma** intelligible to modern people.
    - This process does not discard the message but reinterprets it for contemporary existence.
    - "What matters is not the mythological world picture but the understanding of human existence which it expresses." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter over Objective Knowledge**
    - Knowledge of God is not attained through historical or scientific investigation.
    - True understanding arises from existential response to the **kerygma**.
    - Faith is a personal, existential act, not assent to propositions.
    - The subjectivity of faith is essential for authentic knowledge of God.
    - "Faith is decision, not the acceptance of a doctrine or a world-view." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Revelation as Event, Not Information**
    - Revelation is an event in which God addresses the individual.
    - It is not the communication of objective facts about God.
    - The Word confronts the hearer and demands a response.
    - Revelation transforms existence rather than imparting new data.
    - "Revelation is not a supernatural communication of truths, but a happening in which man’s existence is laid bare." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Critique of Natural Theology**
    - Bultmann rejects the possibility of knowing God through natural reason or observation.
    - The knowledge of God is not accessible apart from **revelation** in Christ.
    - Natural theology leads to objectification and misses the existential dimension.
    - Only through faith in the proclaimed Word is God truly known.
    - "There is no knowledge of God apart from the revelation in the kerygma." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Historical Skepticism and the Limits of Reason**
    - The historical Jesus cannot be reconstructed with certainty.
    - Faith does not rest on historical proofs but on the existential call of the gospel.
    - The quest for objective certainty is misguided in matters of faith.
    - The meaning of the gospel transcends historical contingencies.
    - "We can know almost nothing concerning the life and personality of Jesus." (Jesus and the Word)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s emphasis on **demythologization** and existential interpretation profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **hermeneutics** and the philosophy of religion. His challenge to traditional notions of **revelation** and the rejection of natural theology provoked significant debate among both liberal and conservative theologians. While his radical separation of faith from history remains controversial, his influence endures in discussions about the nature of **faith**, the interpretation of Scripture, and the limits of human knowledge of God.
