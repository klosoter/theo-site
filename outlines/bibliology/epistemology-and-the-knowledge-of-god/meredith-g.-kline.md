# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline’s approach to **epistemology and the knowledge of God** is rooted in a robust **covenantal framework** and a strong emphasis on **revelation** as the foundation for all true knowledge of God. Kline insists that human knowledge of God is always mediated through **divine self-disclosure**, particularly through **covenant documents** and the **structure of redemptive history**, and that **natural revelation** is interpreted rightly only in light of **special revelation**.

- "Man’s knowledge of God is always a response to God’s prior revelation of himself." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

- God, Heaven and Har Magedon

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Covenantal**
    - God’s knowledge is communicated to humanity through **covenant relationships**.
    - The form and content of revelation are inseparable from the **covenant structure**.
    - Human epistemology is shaped by participation in the **covenant community**.
    - The **Scriptures** function as the authoritative covenant document.
    - "The Bible is itself a covenantal revelation, a documentary embodiment of the Lord’s covenant word." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

2. **Primacy of Special Revelation**
    - **Special revelation** is necessary for a saving and true knowledge of God.
    - **Natural revelation** is real but insufficient due to human sin and suppression of truth.
    - The **redemptive-historical acts** of God interpret and clarify general revelation.
    - The fullness of God’s self-disclosure is found in the **Christ event** and its scriptural witness.
    - "Special revelation is the interpretive key to all other revelation." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **The Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - Human knowledge is always analogical, never identical to God’s knowledge.
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** safeguards against both rationalism and skepticism.
    - Epistemology must respect the ontological gap between God and humanity.
    - True knowledge is possible because God accommodates himself to human capacity.
    - "God’s thoughts are not our thoughts, yet he makes himself known truly, though not exhaustively." (Images of the Spirit)

4. **Covenantal Sanctions and Knowledge**
    - Knowledge of God is not merely intellectual but involves **covenantal loyalty**.
    - The reception or rejection of revelation brings **blessing or curse**.
    - Epistemology is inherently ethical, bound up with obedience or rebellion.
    - The **oath structure** of the covenant frames the human response to revelation.
    - "The knowledge of God is inseparable from the sanctions of the covenant." (By Oath Consigned)

5. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Epistemology**
    - God’s revelation unfolds progressively through **typology** and historical events.
    - Knowledge of God deepens as redemptive history advances toward fulfillment in Christ.
    - The **eschatological** dimension of revelation shapes present understanding.
    - Biblical symbols and types are divinely intended means of communicating truth.
    - "Typology is the divinely ordained epistemological bridge between promise and fulfillment." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal approach to **epistemology** has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in its insistence on the priority of **special revelation** and the centrality of the **covenant**. His work has influenced generations of scholars in understanding the relationship between **revelation**, history, and human knowledge of God. Kline’s emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the ethical dimensions of knowledge continues to inform contemporary discussions in systematic theology and hermeneutics.
