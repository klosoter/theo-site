# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen argued that **knowledge of God** is both possible and necessary, rooted in the objective **revelation** of God in Scripture and supremely in **Jesus Christ**. He rejected both rationalistic and mystical approaches, insisting that **faith** involves assent to truth claims grounded in historical facts and divine self-disclosure, and that **epistemology** must account for the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit in enabling true knowledge.

- "Without the objective revelation, faith would degenerate into mere feeling; without the inward work of the Spirit, it would be dead orthodoxy." ("Christianity and Liberalism")

## Key Works

- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- The Christian Faith in the Modern World (1936)
- What Is Faith? (1925)
- The Origin of Paul's Religion (1921)
- "The Scientific Preparation of the Minister" (1912)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Objective and Historical**
    - God has made Himself known through concrete acts in history, culminating in Christ.
    - **Scripture** is the authoritative record of this revelation.
    - Knowledge of God is not a human construct but is received from God's initiative.
    - The facts of Christianity are public and accessible, not hidden in private experience.
    - "Christianity is based upon an account of something that happened, and the Christian worker is primarily a witness." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Faith Involves Intellectual Assent**
    - Faith is not mere feeling or trust, but includes assent to **propositional truth**.
    - The content of faith is inseparable from the facts of **revelation**.
    - True faith requires knowledge of who God is and what He has done.
    - The intellect is not opposed to faith but is essential for genuine belief.
    - "Faith cannot stand by itself; it must be attached to something, and that something is the gospel." (What Is Faith?)

3. **Supernatural Work of the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables sinners to apprehend and accept divine truth.
    - Human reason alone is insufficient due to the effects of sin.
    - Regeneration is necessary for true knowledge of God.
    - The Spirit works through the Word, not apart from it.
    - "It is by the inward work of the Spirit that the facts become real and vital to the soul." (Christianity and Liberalism)

4. **Antithesis with Modernism and Liberalism**
    - Modernist approaches undermine the possibility of true knowledge of God.
    - Liberalism reduces Christianity to ethical ideals, severing it from revelation.
    - Machen defends the necessity of doctrinal truth for genuine faith.
    - The epistemological divide is rooted in differing views of revelation and authority.
    - "The chief modern rival of Christianity is not paganism, but a religion which is only a feeble imitation of Christianity." (Christianity and Liberalism)

5. **Integration of History and Doctrine**
    - Doctrinal truth is inseparable from historical events, especially the resurrection.
    - Knowledge of God is grounded in what God has done in time and space.
    - The facts of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection are foundational for faith.
    - Theological reflection must always return to the historical basis of revelation.
    - "The Christian movement at its inception was not just a way of life in the modern sense, but a way of life founded upon a message." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s defense of **objective revelation** and the necessity of doctrinal truth shaped 20th-century **Reformed epistemology** and confessional orthodoxy. His critique of liberalism clarified the stakes in debates over the **knowledge of God** and the authority of Scripture. Machen’s insistence on the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit and the integration of history and doctrine continues to influence evangelical and Reformed approaches to epistemology and apologetics.
