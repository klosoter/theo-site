# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich developed a distinctive approach to **epistemology** and the **knowledge of God** by emphasizing the role of **ultimate concern**, **symbol**, and **revelation**. He rejected both classical theism’s rational proofs and strict fideism, arguing that knowledge of God arises through the existential encounter with the **Ground of Being** mediated by symbols and participation in **being-itself**.

- "God is the answer to the question implied in man's finitude." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- The Courage to Be
- Dynamics of Faith
- Theology of Culture
- The Shaking of the Foundations

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as the Ground of Being**
    - God is not a being among beings but the very **Ground of Being** itself.
    - Human knowledge of God is indirect, mediated through existential experience.
    - God cannot be objectified or fully grasped by finite reason.
    - The divine is encountered in the depth dimension of all reality.
    - "God does not exist. He is being-itself beyond essence and existence." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

2. **Revelation through Symbol**
    - All knowledge of God is mediated through **symbols** that participate in the reality they signify.
    - Symbols open up levels of reality otherwise inaccessible to empirical or rational inquiry.
    - Religious language is inherently symbolic, not literal or propositional.
    - Symbols must be alive and capable of expressing the ultimate.
    - "Religious symbols are double-edged: they both reveal and conceal the divine." (Dynamics of Faith)

3. **Ultimate Concern as the Basis of Faith**
    - Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned, which shapes all knowing and being.
    - Ultimate concern is directed toward the unconditional and transcendent.
    - Knowledge of God is existential, rooted in the depth of personal commitment.
    - This concern transcends rational certainty and empirical verification.
    - "Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned." (Dynamics of Faith)

4. **Correlation Method**
    - Theology must correlate the existential questions of human existence with the answers given in Christian revelation.
    - Human experience and divine revelation are in constant dialogue.
    - The method seeks to make Christian claims intelligible to contemporary culture.
    - It avoids both subjectivism and objectivism in theological epistemology.
    - "The method of correlation explains the contents of the Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

5. **Existential Estrangement and the Quest for Meaning**
    - Human beings experience **estrangement** from the Ground of Being, leading to anxiety and the search for meaning.
    - Knowledge of God is sought in response to existential questions about existence, meaning, and non-being.
    - The experience of finitude and estrangement drives the quest for the divine.
    - The knowledge of God is transformative, not merely cognitive.
    - "Man's ultimate concern must be expressed symbolically, because symbolic language alone is able to express the ultimate." (Dynamics of Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **epistemology** profoundly influenced 20th-century theology by reframing the knowledge of God in existential and symbolic terms. His **method of correlation** provided a model for engaging theology with contemporary philosophy and culture. While his rejection of propositional revelation and emphasis on symbolism have been criticized by some orthodox theologians, Tillich’s work remains foundational for discussions on the limits of religious language and the existential dimensions of faith. His thought continues to shape debates on the nature of **revelation** and the possibility of knowing God.
