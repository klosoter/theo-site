### ESSAY
Epistemology and the knowledge of God asks how creatures who are finite and fallen can know the infinite and holy God in a way that is genuine knowledge rather than projection, illusion, or idolatry. Theologically, this requires holding together several anchors: **creator–creature distinction**, **divine incomprehensibility**, the **noetic effects of sin**, and the **covenantal** character of all human knowing. Philosophically, it must face challenges from skepticism, empiricism, rationalism, and modern accounts of rationality and justification. In a Westminster context, the decisive pressure points are whether natural **knowledge of God** is possible, what kind of knowledge it is, how sin distorts it, and whether Christian belief can be rationally held in a hostile intellectual environment. The figures who most sharply crystallize these issues for us are Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Karl Barth, Cornelius Van Til, and Alvin Plantinga.

Thomas Aquinas represents the classical synthesis in which **knowledge of God** is framed within an Aristotelian metaphysics and a robust **doctrine of analogy**. For Aquinas, God as pure act and first cause is the necessary ontological ground of all being and knowing. As a result, he insists on both **divine simplicity** and **divine incomprehensibility**: God’s essence is one, without composition, and beyond the grasp of any creaturely concept. This would seem to threaten the possibility of any positive knowledge of God, but Aquinas answers by his doctrine of **analogical predication**. When we say that God is good or wise, these terms are neither univocal nor merely equivocal; rather, there is a proportioned similarity grounded in causal participation. Creatures possess goodness as a finite participation in the infinite goodness that God is. This ontological participation grounds a real, though analogical, semantic similarity in our language.

Epistemologically, Aquinas is neither a pure empiricist nor a sheer rationalist but develops an Aristotelian account: all our knowledge begins with sense, but the intellect abstracts universal forms and can reason to God as first cause. He famously argues that while we do not have natural knowledge of the divine essence, we can know that God exists and some of his attributes via the **via causalitatis**, **via negationis**, and **via eminentiae**. The “five ways” are instances of this natural theology. They do not start from alleged neutrality but from the shared experience of motion, causality, and contingency and reason upward to a necessary being. Aquinas also affirms that a kind of general awareness of God is common and that grace is needed for knowledge of God as Trinity and for salvific faith, but he will still speak of “preambles of faith” that can be known by natural reason.

For oral examiners, Aquinas raises two key questions. First, does analogical language actually secure genuine **knowledge of God**, or does it dissolve into agnosticism about the divine essence? Reformed theology has generally affirmed a modified **analogical knowledge** in which we truly know God but never comprehend him, maintaining the asymmetry that Aquinas stressed while grounding it not in participation metaphysics alone but in covenantal revelation. Second, is Aquinas’ confidence in natural theology compatible with a robust doctrine of sin? It is precisely here that later Reformed theology both depends on and reconfigures Aquinas.

John Calvin marks a decisive re-centering of epistemology within a covenantal and redemptive framework. Calvin’s Institutes begin not with abstract being but with the twin knowledge of God and of self, already indicating that **knowledge of God** is not a neutral theoretical construct but existential and relational. For Calvin, there is a natural **sensus divinitatis**: an inborn sense of the divine that renders all humans inescapably aware of God as creator and judge. The created order is a “theater of God’s glory,” and the human conscience confirms his moral law. This means that, at the level of ontology and providence, all knowledge is already **covenantal**: humans live and know as image-bearers addressed by God.

Yet Calvin emphasizes the **noetic effects of sin** more forcefully than Aquinas. The problem is not that God has failed to reveal himself or that the natural order is epistemically opaque; rather, sinners “by their own depravity are so blinded that they misuse and corrupt the excellent gifts of God.” They do not become epistemic blank slates. Instead, they actively suppress, distort, and exchange the true God for idols, a theme that later Reformed thought will connect closely with Romans 1. The result is that natural **knowledge of God** persists but is functionally idolatrous apart from grace. This brings an internal debate among Reformed theologians: does such natural knowledge count as genuine knowledge, or only as culpable awareness? Calvin himself can sound quite strong, calling pagan insights “admirable” gifts of God, yet he insists that they never lead to saving knowledge without the light of the gospel.

Calvin’s positive alternative is to root all sound **knowledge of God** in **special revelation** and especially in Christ as the mirror of the Father. The Spirit’s internal testimony, or **testimonium Spiritus Sancti**, is not a private mystical voice but the Spirit’s work through Scripture to produce conviction of its divine origin and truth. This anticipates later discussions of warrant: the ultimate ground of the believer’s certainty is not an independent chain of arguments but the Spirit-authenticated Word. This is not fideism, because the same Spirit who inspired Scripture is the creator of the human mind and the providential governor of history, so rational, historical, and experiential evidences may function as secondary confirmations. But Calvin reorders epistemic priorities: **faith** is not a tentative hypothesis awaiting external verification but a Spirit-given certainty anchored in Christ and his Word.

One likely examiner objection here is whether Calvin’s emphasis on divine testimony and **sensus divinitatis** leaves room for genuine public reason. Does it collapse into “it is true for us because the Spirit told us”? The Reformed answer, following Calvin, is that the Spirit’s testimony is not private or irrational but covenantally public: it is inseparably tied to objective external revelation and can be vindicated by its explanatory power, coherence, and transformative efficacy, even though it is not grounded in these as its ultimate warrant.

The twentieth century forces a reexamination of natural **knowledge of God** through Karl Barth’s radical critique of natural theology. Barth insists that God is the one who reveals himself sovereignly in Jesus Christ and that any attempt to start with human religious consciousness, metaphysical first principles, or natural reason leads to a domesticated deity. For Barth, classical natural theology mistakes creaturely categories for a point of contact and thereby denies the qualitative **infinite–finite distinction**. Revelation is an event in which God speaks his Word; it cannot be deduced as a conclusion of a syllogism. Barth’s famous “Nein” to Brunner’s proposal for a modest natural theology is rooted in his conviction that sin has fundamentally corrupted human capacity for God, so that any appeal to a remaining “point of contact” in human nature risks naturalizing grace.

Barth’s attack heightens the internal Reformed debate. One stream, influenced by Barth, downplays or even denies the reality of natural **knowledge of God** in any positive sense, emphasizing instead the sheer gratuity of revelation. Another stream, more attuned to Calvin and the Reformed scholastics, affirms that all humans do know God by nature, but that this knowledge is always religiously misused apart from grace. From a Westminster standpoint, the confessional documents clearly affirm both natural revelation and its insufficiency for salvation. So the theological task is to avoid both rationalist confidence in natural theology and Barthian overreaction that erases the biblical teaching that creation and conscience reveal God.

Cornelius Van Til emerges precisely at this juncture with a covenantal, antithetical, and presuppositional Reformed epistemology. Van Til absorbs both the Reformed emphasis on **sensus divinitatis** and noetic depravity and the Barthian concern to protect **divine self-revelation** as epistemically basic, yet he refuses Barth’s rejection of natural revelation. For Van Til, the crucial epistemic distinction is not between natural and supernatural realms of data, but between two ethical responses to the same revelation: covenant-keeping and covenant-breaking. All humans, as image-bearers, are inescapably confronted by God’s revelation in nature, history, and conscience. They possess true **knowledge of God**, but as Romans 1 indicates, they “suppress the truth in unrighteousness.” Thus the unbeliever is not a blank skeptic but a covenant-breaker who is simultaneously dependent on and in rebellion against God.

Van Til’s signature move is to argue that all reasoning is **presuppositional** and that the Christian worldview alone provides the necessary preconditions of intelligibility for any knowledge whatsoever. The principium cognoscendi is Scripture, not as a bare text but as the triune God speaking. The principium essendi is the self-contained, ontologically triune God. This means that the Christian does not concede an allegedly neutral, autonomous common ground with the unbeliever. Instead, the apologist challenges the unbeliever’s own presuppositions by a transcendental argument: unless the Christian God exists, there is no basis for logic, science, morality, or personal identity. Van Til thus intensifies **analogical knowledge** into a broader **creator–creature epistemic asymmetry**: all human knowledge is derivative, dependent, and thinking God’s thoughts after him.

An examiner will likely press whether Van Til’s position collapses into a vicious circularity: you claim Scripture is authoritative because God says so in Scripture, but how do you know it is God speaking? Van Til’s response is that all ultimate commitments are in some sense circular, since one’s highest authority cannot be justified by appealing to a yet higher authority. The issue is not whether there is circularity, but whether the circle is self-authenticating and fruitful. The Christian circle, grounded in the triune God’s self-revelation, can account for the intelligibility of experience, whereas autonomous circles cannot. He also insists that this transcendental argument does not preclude the use of evidences, but relocates them within a framework where they can function meaningfully.

Van Til’s approach has triggered an internal Reformed debate. Some, like John Frame, have sought a “modified presuppositionalism” that allows more explicit appreciation of common ground and natural theology while retaining covenantal antithesis. Others question whether Van Til overstates the epistemic effects of sin and underplays the positive insights of unbelieving thought. Theologically, the central issue is balancing **antithesis** and **common grace**: unbelievers are in principial rebellion, yet God restrains sin and allows genuine, though fragmentary and misdirected, truth in their thinking.

Enter Alvin Plantinga, whose analytic Reformed epistemology recasts many of these themes in the language of contemporary analytic philosophy. Plantinga is not primarily a biblical theologian, yet his work on warrant and properly basic beliefs has profoundly shaped how Christians articulate the rationality of **knowledge of God**. His key thesis is that belief in God can be **properly basic**, that is, rational, warranted, and not inferred from other beliefs, much as our belief in the existence of an external world or other minds is basic. Drawing influences from Calvin’s **sensus divinitatis**, Plantinga proposes that God has designed humans with a cognitive faculty that, when functioning properly in the right circumstances, produces belief in God. Under these conditions, belief in God has warrant even apart from formal arguments or evidences.

Plantinga’s critique of classical foundationalism is central. Classical foundationalism required that a rational belief must either be self-evident, incorrigible, or derived from such beliefs. This standard would eliminate not only belief in God but also most of our commonsense beliefs. Plantinga argues instead for a **proper functionalism** in which warrant is a matter of cognitive faculties functioning according to a good design plan in a congenial environment aimed at truth. On Christian theism, belief in God fits this model. The noetic effects of sin, however, introduce malfunction: the **sensus divinitatis** is damaged or suppressed, so that natural **knowledge of God** is obscured. This partially parallels Van Til’s emphasis on suppression, yet Plantinga does not build a full transcendental critique of unbelief.

Plantinga also extends this model to Christian belief more broadly in his account of the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit. Faith in the gospel is not the result of a probabilistic inference from historical data, but of the Spirit producing belief through Scripture and preaching. On his model, such faith can have a high degree of warrant even when the believer is unable to answer all objections or provide detailed evidential support. This is crucial for contemporary pastoral and apologetic situations involving doubt: one can maintain that a relatively uneducated believer’s trust in Christ may be more epistemically secure than a skeptic’s theories, because the source and design plan of the former are reliable.

A fair examiner challenge is whether Plantinga’s model is too subjectivist or tradition-relative. Cannot any religious community claim that its beliefs are produced by a “design plan” and thus count as properly basic? Plantinga responds by insisting that proper function must be specified in terms of the actual design plan laid down by the true God. Competing theisms cannot all be right. Moreover, his project is not to show that Christian belief is the only rational option, but to rebut the charge that it is irrational or unjustified without evidence. To go further one must still engage in **external** debates, historical arguments, and the internal coherence of the Christian story, where Van Til’s and Calvin’s insights about **covenant**, **antithesis**, and Scripture’s authority become vital.

When we assemble these figures, several layers of debate emerge. Internally, there is a spectrum from Aquinas’s stronger confidence in natural theology, through Calvin’s robust **sensus divinitatis** under the shadow of sin, to Barth’s suspicion of any appeal to nature, Van Til’s antithetical presuppositionalism, and Plantinga’s analytic rehabilitation of natural and special **knowledge of God** as properly basic. Externally, Christian epistemology confronts classical foundationalism, empiricist skepticism, and postmodern suspicion of metanarratives. Contemporary debates about religious pluralism, deconversion, and science–faith tensions raise acute practical questions: can one still affirm the rationality and objectivity of Christian **knowledge of God** in a late modern context of contested authorities and pervasive doubt.

The position to be defended, suitable for a Westminster oral defense, is a covenantal Reformed epistemology that integrates and critiques these contributions. This position affirms, against Barthian overcorrection, that there is real natural **knowledge of God** available to all humans through creation and conscience. This knowledge is not a neutral, probabilistic conclusion but a direct awareness arising from the **sensus divinitatis** and the inescapable presence of God as creator and judge. It is genuine **analogical knowledge**: true yet never comprehensive, always respecting the **creator–creature distinction** and **divine incomprehensibility**. However, because of the **noetic effects of sin**, this natural knowledge is always suppressed and perverted into idolatry apart from grace. Therefore, in agreement with Calvin, Van Til, and in a qualified sense Plantinga, all saving and rightly ordered knowledge of God depends on **special revelation** and the Spirit’s renewing work.

Within this framework, natural theology is possible, but only when subordinated to and normed by Scripture. One may argue, along Aquinas, that the existence and some attributes of God are knowable by reason. Yet methodologically, Reformed theology refuses to grant such reasoning a position as independent court over revelation. Instead, natural theological arguments can function as expressions of, and appeals to, a natural awareness that is already present but suppressed. The apologist therefore does not seek to move the unbeliever from neutrality to belief, but to expose the unbeliever’s dependence on God at every point and the inner incoherence of unbelieving presuppositions. Here Van Til’s **transcendental critique** is indispensable, even if enriched by Plantinga’s more detailed account of cognitive design and warrant.

This covenantal epistemology has implications for adjacent loci. In theology proper, it guards **divine simplicity** and **incomprehensibility** by insisting that all our concepts of God are analogical and grounded in his own self-naming acts in history and Scripture. In anthropology, it asserts that to be human is to be a knower of God, so that agnosticism is not an innocent absence but a culpable suppression. In hamartiology, it frames sin as not only moral but also epistemic rebellion, leading to **worldview** systems that attempt to secure meaning without reference to the creator. In soteriology, it underlines that faith is not a leap into darkness but a Spirit-enabled coming to the light of a God we have always, in some sense, known. In ecclesiology, it highlights the role of the church as a community of **testimony** whose teaching, sacraments, and discipline function as means by which **knowledge of God** is clarified, deepened, and defended.

Examiner-style objections must be anticipated. One might ask whether this view leaves any space for genuine learning from non-Christian thinkers. The answer is that, on a Reformed view of **common grace**, unbelievers can and do arrive at many true beliefs and develop sophisticated theories because God restrains sin and because they cannot escape their status as image-bearers. However, at the level of ultimate commitments, their systems remain religiously misdirected. We can gratefully receive their insights while subjecting their frameworks to biblical critique. Another objection is whether the strong claims about natural **knowledge of God** are falsified by the apparent existence of sincere atheists. Reformed theology responds that subjective sincerity does not negate the reality of deeper-level awareness. The suppression of truth can be so thorough that one no longer consciously recognizes what, at a more basic level, one knows and resists.

A further objection concerns religious pluralism: if many religions claim **knowledge of God**, does this not undermine our claim to know the true God? Here both Van Til and Plantinga are useful. Van Til stresses that alternative religions are, at bottom, variations on the suppression of the true God and replacement with idols, though always parasitic on borrowed capital from the biblical worldview. Plantinga underscores that the rationality of Christian belief does not depend on the defeat of every alternative at the level of shared neutral criteria, which do not exist. Rather, the Christian has warrant grounded in God’s own design and testimony, which can coexist with the existence of rival claims, even as those claims are engaged apologetically and pastorally.

Finally, the contemporary crisis of doubt and deconversion poses pastoral questions. Can a believer who struggles with intellectual objections still be said to have **knowledge of God**? Within the defended position, yes, because knowledge is not exhausted by current phenomenology of certainty. If the Spirit has united a person to Christ and continues to witness through Scripture, then that person’s faith retains warrant even amid psychological doubt. Intellectual objections must be taken seriously and addressed, using both evidential resources and transcendental critique, but they do not automatically displace the Spirit’s deeper work. The Christian’s epistemic life is thus communal, liturgical, and sanctificational, not merely a set of individual judgments.

To summarize the defended stance: all humans possess natural, analogical **knowledge of God** as creator, grounded in **sensus divinitatis** and general revelation, but this knowledge is universally suppressed in unrighteousness. Sound, saving, and rightly ordered **knowledge of God** arises only from God’s own covenantal self-revelation in Christ and Scripture, applied by the Spirit, and is best articulated within a presuppositional, covenantal framework that both appreciates the reality of natural revelation and exposes the futility of autonomous reason. This position integrates the strengths and critiques the weaknesses of Aquinas, Calvin, Barth, Van Til, and Plantinga, and provides a coherent basis for defending the rationality, objectivity, and universality of Christian knowledge of the triune God under rigorous examination.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Knowledge of God** is finite, analogical, covenantal awareness of the triune God given by his self-revelation in creation and Scripture, always present in all humans yet only saving and properly ordered through Christ and the Spirit, under the constraints of **creator–creature distinction** and **divine incomprehensibility**.  
- Decisive figures:  
  - Aquinas: classical **analogical knowledge** and natural theology via causal reasoning to God.  
  - Calvin: **sensus divinitatis**, noetic effects of sin, and Spirit-wrought certainty through Scripture.  
  - Barth: radical prioritizing of revelation and “Nein” to natural theology.  
  - Van Til: covenantal, presuppositional epistemology, antithesis, and transcendental critique.  
  - Plantinga: analytic account of **properly basic** theistic and Christian belief via proper function and design plan.  
- Debates:  
  - Internal: scope and status of natural theology, relation of **sensus divinitatis** to sin, degree of antithesis versus common ground, and roles of evidence versus presupposition.  
  - External: foundationalism, evidentialism, empiricist and postmodern skepticism, and Barthian rejection of natural **knowledge of God**.  
  - Contemporary: religious pluralism, deconversion and doubt, science and faith, and the rationality of basic theistic belief.  
- Defended position: Covenantal Reformed epistemology affirming universal, analogical natural **knowledge of God** that is suppressed in sin, with saving and properly warranted knowledge arising only from special revelation in Christ and Scripture, articulated in a presuppositional yet non-fideistic framework that can incorporate natural theology and analytic insights.  
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:  
  - Is natural theology legitimate for a Reformed theologian?  
    - Yes, subordinated to Scripture and understood as addressing already present but suppressed **knowledge of God**, not as neutral proof from autonomy.  
  - How is **analogical knowledge** different from agnosticism?  
    - It affirms true but never comprehensive predication about God, grounded in his own self-revelation and not in univocal comprehension of his essence.  
  - Are unbelievers genuinely knowing God or only believing falsehoods?  
    - They truly know God as creator and judge but misdirect and suppress that knowledge into idolatrous systems, rendering them culpable.  
  - Does presuppositionalism rule out evidences?  
    - No, it re-situates evidences within a framework that denies autonomy and uses them to expose the unbeliever’s dependence on God.  
  - What makes Christian belief more than just one basic belief among many religious options?  
    - Its warrant arises from the true God’s design plan and Spirit’s testimony and is confirmed by its unique ability to ground intelligibility, morality, and redemption in a coherent **covenantal** narrative.
