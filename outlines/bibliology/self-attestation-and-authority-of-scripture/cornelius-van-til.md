# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til advanced a robust doctrine of the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** grounded in a consistently **Reformed epistemology**. He argued that the Bible is authoritative not by appeal to external evidences or church pronouncements, but because it is the very **Word of God** and thus carries its own intrinsic authority, recognized through the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit**.

- "The Bible is authoritative on its own authority because it is the voice of God speaking." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- The Doctrine of Scripture (in The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture)
- A Christian Theory of Knowledge
- The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible (with Ned B. Stonehouse)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Self-Attestation**
    - Scripture claims and demonstrates its own authority as the Word of God.
    - No higher standard or external authority can authenticate Scripture.
    - The self-attesting nature of Scripture is rooted in God’s own self-revelation.
    - Human reason is subordinate to the divine authority of Scripture.
    - "Scripture must be accepted on its own authority, or not at all." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Authority Rooted in Divine Authorship**
    - The authority of Scripture derives from its origin in the triune God.
    - The Bible is not merely a record of revelation but revelation itself.
    - Divine authorship guarantees the truthfulness and reliability of Scripture.
    - To question Scripture’s authority is to question God’s own authority.
    - "God’s authority and the authority of his Word are one and the same." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Necessity of Presuppositions**
    - All reasoning is governed by ultimate presuppositions.
    - The Christian must presuppose the truth of Scripture in all thought.
    - Neutrality is impossible; one either stands on God’s Word or rejects it.
    - Apologetics must begin with the presupposed authority of Scripture.
    - "There is no position of epistemological neutrality." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Internal Testimony of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit enables believers to recognize the authority of Scripture.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s truth is not based on human argumentation.
    - The Spirit’s witness is necessary for conviction of Scripture’s divine origin.
    - This testimony is distinct from but not opposed to rational evidence.
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who gives us the certainty that the Bible is the Word of God." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Antithesis Between Belief and Unbelief**
    - There is a fundamental opposition between Christian and non-Christian epistemologies.
    - Unbelievers suppress the truth of God revealed in Scripture.
    - Only regeneration enables true submission to Scriptural authority.
    - Apologetic encounters must expose the antithesis and point to Scripture’s self-attestation.
    - "The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **self-attesting authority of Scripture** has profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and theology, especially through the development of **presuppositionalism**. His insistence on the necessity of starting with the Bible’s own claims has influenced generations of theologians and apologists, particularly within the Westminster tradition. Van Til’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the foundations of **biblical authority** and the relationship between faith and reason.
