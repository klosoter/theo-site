# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **authority of Scripture** not as a self-contained or self-attesting reality, but as something grounded in the **historical revelation of God** culminating in Jesus Christ. He challenged the notion of **Scripture’s self-attestation** by emphasizing the role of **public, historical evidence** and the **universal rationality** of Christian claims, arguing that the authority of the Bible is ultimately validated in the open arena of history and reason.

- "Revelation is not a private event but is open to public inquiry and verification." (Revelation as History)

## Key Works

- Revelation as History (1968)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (1988)
- Basic Questions in Theology (1970)
- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Theology and the Philosophy of Science (1976)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Historical, Not Merely Propositional**
    - God’s self-disclosure occurs in historical events, especially in the resurrection of Jesus.
    - Scripture witnesses to these events rather than constituting revelation in itself.
    - The authority of the Bible is derivative from the authority of God’s acts in history.
    - Revelation is accessible to all through historical investigation, not just ecclesial proclamation.
    - "The revelation of God is not identical with the biblical text but with the reality to which the text bears witness." (Revelation as History)

2. **Scripture’s Authority is Mediated by Christ**
    - The center of revelation is the person and work of Jesus Christ.
    - The Bible’s authority is grounded in its witness to Christ, not in its own self-attestation.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the decisive event validating the biblical witness.
    - The authority of Scripture is thus Christological and historical, not merely textual.
    - "The authority of Scripture is inseparable from the authority of Christ to whom it testifies." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Public Verifiability and Rationality**
    - Revelation must be open to rational and historical scrutiny.
    - Faith is not a leap beyond evidence but a response to God’s acts in history.
    - The self-attestation of Scripture is insufficient without public, historical grounding.
    - Christian claims must be universally accessible, not based on private certainty.
    - "Christian faith appeals to the public, historical reality of God’s revelation." (Basic Questions in Theology)

4. **Critique of Subjectivism and Fideism**
    - Rejects the idea that Scripture’s authority rests on subjective inner witness alone.
    - Warns against a closed, circular argument for biblical authority.
    - Emphasizes the need for external, historical validation of revelation.
    - Sees fideism as undermining the universal claim of Christian truth.
    - "Faith must not be separated from the critical examination of its historical basis." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

5. **Scripture as Normative Witness, Not Revelation Itself**
    - The Bible is a normative witness to revelation, not the revelation itself.
    - Its authority is functional, pointing beyond itself to God’s acts.
    - The church recognizes the canon because of its unique witness to Christ.
    - The authority of Scripture is dynamic, rooted in ongoing encounter with the risen Christ.
    - "Scripture is authoritative as the normative witness to the revelation event, not as revelation in itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to the **authority of Scripture** has significantly shaped modern theology’s engagement with **historical criticism** and the relationship between faith and reason. By grounding biblical authority in the public, historical reality of God’s acts, he offered a robust alternative to both **Barthian neo-orthodoxy** and traditional Protestant views of self-attestation. His emphasis on **universal rationality** and historical verifiability continues to influence contemporary discussions on revelation, apologetics, and the nature of theological authority.
