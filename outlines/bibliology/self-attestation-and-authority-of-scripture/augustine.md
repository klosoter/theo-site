# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine grounded the **authority of Scripture** in its divine origin, holding that the **canonical books** possess a unique, self-authenticating quality. He argued that the **self-attestation** of Scripture is confirmed by the witness of the **Holy Spirit** and the consensus of the **church**, which recognizes but does not create the canon’s authority.

- "I would not believe the Gospel unless moved by the authority of the Catholic Church." (Against the Epistle of Manichaeus Called Fundamental, 5.6)

## Key Works

- On Christian Doctrine (De Doctrina Christiana)
- The City of God (De Civitate Dei)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Divine Origin**
    - Scripture is authored by God and thus possesses inherent authority.
    - The divine nature of Scripture is recognized through its unique power and coherence.
    - Human authors are instruments inspired by the Holy Spirit.
    - The authority of Scripture is not dependent on human approval.
    - "For it is not men who have made the canon of Scripture authoritative, but rather it was already authoritative, and men have recognized it as such." (On Christian Doctrine, 2.8)

2. **Self-attestation of Scripture**
    - Scripture bears witness to its own truth and authority.
    - The internal testimony of the Holy Spirit confirms Scripture’s authenticity to the believer.
    - The clarity and majesty of Scripture distinguish it from all other writings.
    - Self-attestation is not subjective but rooted in the objective work of the Spirit.
    - "The Scriptures are holy, they are truthful, they are divine; I fear to say anything of them that is not in them." (On the Psalms, 56.1)

3. **Role of the Church in Recognizing Canon**
    - The church serves as a witness to the canon, not its creator.
    - The consensus of the universal church aids in discerning authentic Scripture.
    - The authority of Scripture precedes the church’s recognition.
    - The church’s tradition helps guard against heretical distortions.
    - "I should not believe the Gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic Church." (Against the Epistle of Manichaeus Called Fundamental, 5.6)

4. **Infallibility and Inerrancy of Scripture**
    - Scripture, as God’s Word, cannot err or deceive.
    - Apparent contradictions are due to human misunderstanding or textual corruption.
    - The truthfulness of Scripture is foundational for doctrine and faith.
    - All teachings must be measured against the infallible standard of Scripture.
    - "For I confess to your charity that I have learned to yield this respect and honor only to the canonical books of Scripture: of these alone do I most firmly believe that the authors were completely free from error." (Letters, 82.3)

5. **Scripture as Rule of Faith**
    - Scripture is the supreme norm for Christian belief and practice.
    - All doctrines must be tested by the canonical Scriptures.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture is upheld against rival authorities.
    - The unity of Scripture provides a coherent foundation for theology.
    - "Let us treat the Scriptures as the rule of our faith." (On Christian Doctrine, 3.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** profoundly shaped Western Christianity, especially in the development of the **doctrine of canon** and the role of the church in recognizing Scripture. His emphasis on the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** influenced later Reformed thought, notably in Calvin and the Westminster Confession. Augustine’s nuanced view of the relationship between Scripture and church authority remains foundational for both Catholic and Protestant approaches to biblical authority.
