# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck maintained that the **authority of Scripture** is grounded in its own **self-attestation** as the Word of God, not in external validation or ecclesiastical decree. He argued that the **Holy Spirit** inwardly persuades believers of Scripture’s divine origin, making its authority both objective and subjectively recognized. This conviction is central to Bavinck’s Reformed doctrine of **revelation** and **inspiration**.

- "Holy Scripture bears within itself the evidence of its divine origin." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority Is Self-Attesting**
    - Scripture possesses inherent authority as the Word of God, independent of human approval.
    - The church recognizes, but does not confer, the authority of Scripture.
    - Self-attestation is rooted in the nature of divine revelation itself.
    - The authority of Scripture is inseparable from its content and origin.
    - "Scripture is not authentic because the church says so, but because it is the Word of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

2. **The Testimony of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit works internally to persuade individuals of Scripture’s truth and authority.
    - This testimony is necessary due to human sin and blindness.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority is a spiritual, not merely rational, conviction.
    - The Spirit’s witness is distinct from rational arguments or historical proofs.
    - "The testimony of the Holy Spirit is the only means by which we become convinced of the divine authority of Scripture." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

3. **Organic Inspiration**
    - Inspiration is not mechanical but involves the whole person of the biblical authors.
    - The Spirit’s work preserves the individuality and context of each writer.
    - Organic inspiration ensures both divine authority and genuine human authorship.
    - This view safeguards the unity and diversity of Scripture.
    - "The Holy Spirit did not suppress the individuality of the authors, but used it in the service of revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

4. **Unity of Revelation and Scripture**
    - Scripture is the normative form of God’s self-revelation.
    - The authority of Scripture is grounded in its identity as revelation.
    - There is no separation between the authority of revelation and the authority of Scripture.
    - The canon is closed because revelation is complete in Christ and Scripture.
    - "Scripture is the enduring form of the revelation that God has given in Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

5. **Objective and Subjective Dimensions of Authority**
    - The authority of Scripture is objective, rooted in God’s act of revelation.
    - Subjective recognition by believers is the result of the Spirit’s work.
    - Faith does not create authority but acknowledges what is already true.
    - The church’s confession is a response to, not a basis for, biblical authority.
    - "Faith does not create the authority of Scripture, but is itself created by it." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of the **self-attestation of Scripture** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in discussions of **revelation** and **epistemology**. His emphasis on the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit remains a cornerstone for contemporary Reformed approaches to biblical authority. Bavinck’s nuanced synthesis of objective and subjective elements continues to influence debates on the nature and grounds of **Scripture’s authority** within both academic and ecclesial contexts.
