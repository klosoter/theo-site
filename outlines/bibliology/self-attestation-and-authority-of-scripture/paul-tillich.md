# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **authority of Scripture** not as an external or self-attesting foundation, but as a **symbolic witness** to the **revelation** of the **"New Being"** in Jesus Christ. For Tillich, the **self-attestation** of Scripture is not located in the text itself, but in its existential power to mediate the **Word of God** and elicit an **act of faith** within the community.

- "The Bible is not the revelation itself, but the original document about the events in which revelation occurred." (Systematic Theology, Vol. I)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Symbolic Witness**
    - Scripture functions as a **symbol** that points beyond itself to the **revelation** of God.
    - Its authority is derived from its ability to mediate the **New Being** in Christ.
    - The text is not identical with revelation but is a witness to revelatory events.
    - The symbolic nature of Scripture means its meaning is existentially appropriated.
    - "The Bible is a document about revelation, not revelation itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. I)

2. **Revelation as Event, Not Proposition**
    - Revelation occurs in historical events, supremely in Jesus as the Christ.
    - Scripture records and interprets these events but does not itself constitute revelation.
    - The authority of Scripture is secondary to the authority of the revelatory event.
    - Faith is a response to the event, not to the text as an object.
    - "Revelation is always event and never mere word." (Systematic Theology, Vol. I)

3. **Authority Grounded in Existential Impact**
    - The authority of Scripture is recognized in its power to transform existence.
    - Self-attestation is not a property of the text but of its existential effect.
    - The community discerns authority through the experience of being grasped by the **Word of God**.
    - Authority is dynamic, not static or inherent in the text.
    - "The criterion is the power of the message to create faith and new being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. II)

4. **Critique of Literalism and Propositionalism**
    - Tillich rejects the notion that Scripture’s authority rests on inerrancy or literal self-attestation.
    - He warns against identifying the Word of God with the words of the Bible.
    - Literalism leads to idolatry of the letter rather than encounter with the divine.
    - The truth of Scripture is symbolic and existential, not propositional.
    - "The Word of God is not identical with the words of the Bible." (Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality)

5. **Role of the Community in Recognizing Authority**
    - The church community plays a central role in discerning the authority of Scripture.
    - Authority is actualized in the communal act of faith and interpretation.
    - The canon is recognized as authoritative because it mediates the **New Being** to the community.
    - The process of canonization reflects the existential impact of certain texts.
    - "The authority of the Bible is established by the church’s experience of its revelatory power." (The Protestant Era)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to the **authority of Scripture** profoundly influenced 20th-century **liberal Protestant theology**, shifting focus from propositional revelation to existential encounter. His emphasis on the **symbolic** and **mediating** function of Scripture challenged both fundamentalist and purely historical-critical readings. While his views have been critiqued for undermining traditional doctrines of **inspiration** and **self-attestation**, they remain pivotal in discussions of revelation, hermeneutics, and the nature of religious authority. Tillich’s legacy endures in contemporary debates over how Scripture functions within faith communities.
