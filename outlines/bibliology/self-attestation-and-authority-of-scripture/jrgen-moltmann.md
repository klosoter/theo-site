# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches the **authority of Scripture** through a dynamic, **pneumatological** and **eschatological** lens, emphasizing the role of the **Holy Spirit** and the **Christian community** in actualizing the text’s authority. For Moltmann, Scripture’s authority is not an intrinsic, static property but is realized as it points to the **promise of God** and is actualized in the **hope** of the church.

- "The authority of Scripture is not a property inherent in the text itself, but is given by the Spirit in the event of its being heard and believed." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Church in the Power of the Spirit (1975)
- The Spirit of Life: A Universal Affirmation (1991)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- God in Creation (1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Authority as Eschatological Event**
    - Scripture’s authority unfolds in the context of **God’s future**.
    - The Bible witnesses to the **promise of God** and is authoritative as it directs the community toward hope.
    - The authority of the text is inseparable from the **eschatological horizon** it proclaims.
    - The church’s reading of Scripture is oriented toward the coming kingdom.
    - "Scripture is authoritative because it opens up the future of God’s promise." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Pneumatological Mediation of Authority**
    - The **Holy Spirit** mediates the authority of Scripture in the life of the church.
    - Authority is not an inherent textual property but an event in which the Spirit speaks.
    - The Spirit enables the community to discern and respond to the Word.
    - The authority of Scripture is dynamic, not static, and is realized in communal experience.
    - "The Spirit makes the Word of God present and authoritative in the midst of the congregation." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

3. **Scripture as Witness, Not Object**
    - The Bible is a witness to **God’s revelation**, not the revelation itself.
    - Authority is derivative, pointing beyond itself to the living God.
    - The text’s authority is found in its testimony to **Christ** and the promises of God.
    - The church is called to interpret Scripture as a living witness, not as a closed canon of propositions.
    - "Scripture is not itself revelation, but the witness to revelation." (Experiences in Theology)

4. **Community-Centered Interpretation**
    - The authority of Scripture is realized within the interpretive **community**.
    - The church, guided by the Spirit, discerns the meaning and authority of the text.
    - Scripture’s authority is not imposed but emerges in dialogue with the community’s context and history.
    - The communal reading of Scripture is essential for its authoritative function.
    - "The authority of Scripture is an event in the community of faith." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

5. **Critique of Foundationalism and Inerrancy**
    - Moltmann rejects **foundationalist** approaches to Scripture’s authority.
    - He is critical of **inerrancy** as a static, propositional view of the Bible.
    - Authority is not grounded in the text’s perfection but in its witness to **God’s future**.
    - The self-attestation of Scripture is reinterpreted as the Spirit’s ongoing testimony, not a property of the text alone.
    - "The authority of the Bible does not rest on its inerrancy, but on its power to open up the future of God." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach to the **authority of Scripture** has significantly influenced contemporary theology, especially in ecumenical and liberationist contexts. By emphasizing the **pneumatological** and **eschatological** dimensions of authority, he has challenged traditional Reformed categories and encouraged a more dynamic, community-centered understanding. His work continues to provoke discussion about the nature of biblical authority, especially regarding the role of the Spirit and the church in interpreting Scripture. Moltmann’s legacy is evident in ongoing debates about the relationship between **Scripture**, tradition, and the living witness of the Christian community.
