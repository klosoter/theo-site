# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth grounded the **authority of Scripture** in its function as the unique witness to **God’s self-revelation in Jesus Christ**. For Barth, **self-attestation** is not an inherent property of the biblical text alone but is realized as the Holy Spirit enables Scripture to become the living **Word of God** to the church. Thus, the authority of Scripture is dynamic, rooted in the ongoing event of **divine address** rather than in static textual properties.

- "The Bible is God’s Word to the extent that God causes it to be His Word, to the extent that He speaks through it." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Church Dogmatics I/2: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- The Word of God and the Word of Man

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Event**
   - Revelation is not a static deposit but an act of God’s self-disclosure.
   - Scripture witnesses to revelation but is not identical with it.
   - The authority of Scripture is actualized when God chooses to speak through it.
   - The church is continually dependent on God’s free act to make Scripture His Word.
   - "Revelation means the self-unveiling, impartation, and communication of God Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Scripture as Witness**
   - The Bible is a human document that testifies to God’s revelation in Christ.
   - Its authority derives from its function as a divinely appointed witness.
   - The text itself is not divine, but God uses it to bear witness to Himself.
   - The self-attestation of Scripture is inseparable from its witness-character.
   - "The prophets and apostles as such, and in their humanity, are witnesses." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit enables Scripture to become the Word of God for the reader.
   - Self-attestation is an act of the Spirit, not a property of the text alone.
   - Authority is recognized as the Spirit opens hearts to receive God’s address.
   - The Spirit’s work is necessary for true understanding and acknowledgment of Scripture’s authority.
   - "Only the Holy Spirit can make the Bible the Word of God for us." (Evangelical Theology)

4. **Christocentric Focus**
   - Jesus Christ is the center and content of all true revelation.
   - Scripture’s authority is bound to its witness to Christ.
   - The self-attestation of Scripture is ultimately the self-attestation of Christ through the text.
   - All interpretation and authority are measured by conformity to Christ.
   - "Jesus Christ is the one Word of God which we have to hear and which we have to trust and obey in life and in death." (Barmen Declaration)

5. **Rejection of Inherent Inerrancy**
   - Barth rejects the idea that Scripture’s authority rests on inerrancy or infallibility.
   - The Bible contains human limitations and errors, yet God speaks through it.
   - Authority is not a property of the text’s perfection but of God’s sovereign use.
   - Self-attestation is not a rational proof but an act of faith enabled by God.
   - "The vulnerability of the Bible, i.e., its capacity for error, belongs to its very nature." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s doctrine of the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** reoriented modern theology by emphasizing the dynamic, Christ-centered, and Spirit-enabled nature of biblical authority. His rejection of **inerrancy** and focus on revelation as event challenged both liberal and conservative paradigms. Barth’s influence persists in contemporary debates about the nature of **revelation**, the role of the **Holy Spirit**, and the relationship between Scripture and the living Word of God.
