# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline advanced a distinctive understanding of the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** by grounding them in the covenantal structure of divine revelation. He argued that the Bible’s authority is intrinsic, rooted in its character as a **covenant document** authored by God, and that its self-authenticating nature is inseparable from the work of the **Holy Spirit**. Kline’s approach emphasized the objective, legal character of Scripture’s authority within the framework of **Reformed theology**.

- "The Scriptures are self-attesting as the documentary form of the covenant Lord’s authoritative revelation." ("The Structure of Biblical Authority")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Covenant Document**
   - Scripture is modeled after **ancient Near Eastern suzerainty treaties**, serving as the formal written record of God’s covenant with His people.
   - The authority of Scripture is inseparable from its function as the legal constitution of the covenant community.
   - The form and structure of biblical revelation reflect its status as a binding, divine treaty.
   - The self-attestation of Scripture is rooted in its covenantal form, not merely subjective experience.
   - "The Bible is the documentary embodiment of the Lord’s covenant relationship with his people." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

2. **Intrinsic Authority of Scripture**
   - Scripture’s authority is not derived from external sources but is inherent in its divine authorship.
   - The church recognizes, but does not confer, the authority of the biblical canon.
   - The authority of Scripture is objective, grounded in God’s sovereign will and revelation.
   - The canon is closed because the covenantal document is complete.
   - "The authority of Scripture is not a delegated authority but the direct authority of the Lord himself." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

3. **Self-Attestation and the Holy Spirit**
   - The self-authenticating nature of Scripture is realized through the internal testimony of the **Holy Spirit**.
   - The Spirit enables believers to recognize the divine voice in Scripture.
   - Self-attestation is not circular reasoning but the necessary result of God’s self-revelation.
   - The Spirit’s witness is essential for the certainty of faith in Scripture’s authority.
   - "The Spirit’s witness is not an addition to the Word but the means by which its self-attestation is effectual." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

4. **Rejection of External Grounding**
   - Kline rejects attempts to ground biblical authority in ecclesiastical pronouncements or rational proofs.
   - External evidences may support, but never establish, the authority of Scripture.
   - The authority of Scripture stands independent of human validation.
   - Appeals to tradition or reason are subordinate to Scripture’s own testimony.
   - "The church’s recognition of the canon is an act of submission, not of authorization." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

5. **Covenantal Witness and Canon**
   - The canon is defined by its function as the covenant witness, not by later church decisions.
   - The biblical canon is self-contained, paralleling the legal closure of ancient treaties.
   - The witness of Scripture is both to God’s promises and stipulations, binding upon all recipients.
   - The self-attestation of Scripture is inseparable from its role as the enduring witness of the covenant.
   - "The canon is the closed corpus of the covenant documents, the witness to the Lord’s redemptive acts and words." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal approach to the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** has significantly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in discussions of canon and revelation. His emphasis on the legal and treaty-like structure of Scripture provided a robust framework for understanding its objective authority. Kline’s insights continue to influence debates on the nature of biblical authority, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the relationship between Scripture and tradition within the Reformed tradition.
