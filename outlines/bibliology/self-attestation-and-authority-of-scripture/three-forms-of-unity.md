# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a classic **Reformed doctrine of Scripture**, emphasizing that the Bible is the **Word of God** whose authority is intrinsic and not derived from the church or human testimony. These confessions stress the **self-attestation** of Scripture and the necessity of the **Holy Spirit’s inward witness** for genuine conviction of its truth.

- "We believe that these Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 5–7
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), Lord’s Day 7 and 31
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), Rejection of Errors, Heads I & III/IV
- The Ecumenical Creeds (Apostles’, Nicene, Athanasian) as referenced in the confessions
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority Is Divine, Not Ecclesiastical**
   - The authority of Scripture is grounded in its being the **Word of God**.
   - The church recognizes, but does not confer, this authority.
   - Human testimony may confirm but never establish Scripture’s authority.
   - The confessions reject the claim that the church is above Scripture.
   "We receive all these books, and these only, as holy and canonical, for the regulation, foundation, and confirmation of our faith." (Belgic Confession, Art. 5)

2. **Self-Attestation of Scripture**
   - Scripture bears witness to itself as **divinely inspired** and trustworthy.
   - Its majesty, unity, and efficacy testify to its divine origin.
   - The confessions teach that Scripture is self-authenticating.
   - The internal evidence of Scripture is sufficient for conviction.
   "We believe without a doubt all things contained in them—not so much because the Church receives and approves them as such, but more especially because the Holy Spirit witnesses in our hearts that they are from God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 5)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Certainty**
   - The **Holy Spirit** works inwardly to persuade and assure believers of Scripture’s truth.
   - Faith in Scripture’s authority is ultimately a supernatural work.
   - The Spirit’s testimony is necessary for true conviction.
   - Assurance does not rest on rational arguments alone.
   "The Holy Spirit witnesses in our hearts that they are from God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 5)

4. **Sufficiency and Clarity of Scripture**
   - Scripture contains all things necessary for **salvation** and faith.
   - Nothing may be added to or taken from the Word of God.
   - The confessions affirm the clarity of Scripture in essential matters.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture is a safeguard against tradition’s excesses.
   "We may not consider any writings of men, however holy these men may have been, of equal value with those divine Scriptures." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

5. **Scripture as the Final Judge in Controversies**
   - All doctrinal disputes must be settled by appeal to **Scripture**.
   - The confessions subordinate all councils, creeds, and traditions to the Bible.
   - The Word of God is the ultimate standard for faith and practice.
   - The church is called to submit to Scripture’s judgment in all things.
   "For since it is forbidden to add to or take away from the Word of God, it is evident that the doctrine thereof is most perfect and complete in all respects." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped the **Reformed doctrine of Scripture**, especially regarding its self-attestation and ultimate authority. Their articulation of the Spirit’s inward testimony and the sufficiency of Scripture continues to influence Reformed confessional identity and theological method. These confessions remain foundational for Reformed churches worldwide, providing a bulwark against both ecclesiastical authoritarianism and modern skepticism.
