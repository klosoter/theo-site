# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the encounter between the divine Word and human existence. He rejected the notion of **Scripture as an objective, infallible authority** in itself, instead stressing that its authority is realized in the event of **personal revelation** through the Holy Spirit. For Brunner, the Bible becomes authoritative as it mediates the living **Word of God** to the believer.

- "The Bible is the Word of God in so far as God lets it be His Word, in so far as He speaks through it." (Revelation and Reason)

## Key Works

- Revelation and Reason (1931)
- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- Dogmatics, Vol. 1: The Christian Doctrine of God (1946)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Encounter**
   - Revelation is not a static deposit but a dynamic event between God and the human person.
   - The authority of Scripture is actualized in the existential meeting with the living God.
   - The Bible serves as a witness to revelation, not revelation itself in an absolute sense.
   - The Holy Spirit is essential for the Word to become effective and authoritative.
   - "Revelation is always an event, never a thing." (Revelation and Reason)

2. **Christocentric Authority**
   - Jesus Christ is the center and criterion of all revelation.
   - Scripture’s authority derives from its witness to Christ, not from its textual properties.
   - The self-attestation of Scripture is meaningful only as it points to Christ as the living Word.
   - The authority of the Bible is subordinate to the authority of Christ Himself.
   - "The Bible is authoritative because it is the witness to Christ." (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Rejection of Verbal Inspiration**
   - Brunner denies the doctrine of **verbal inspiration** as a guarantee of infallibility.
   - He views the Bible as a human document, marked by historical and cultural limitations.
   - The authority of Scripture is not grounded in its inerrancy but in its use by God.
   - Faith is not in the text itself but in the God who speaks through it.
   - "The authority of the Bible does not rest upon its infallibility as a book." (Revelation and Reason)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit enables the Bible to become the Word of God in the act of proclamation.
   - Without the Spirit, Scripture remains a closed book, lacking authority and power.
   - The Spirit’s work is necessary for the self-attestation of Scripture to be recognized.
   - The authority of Scripture is existentially realized in the believer’s response.
   - "Only through the Holy Spirit does the Bible become the Word of God for us." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Scripture as Witness, Not Identity**
   - Brunner distinguishes between the Bible as a witness to revelation and revelation itself.
   - The authority of Scripture is derivative, not intrinsic.
   - The Bible’s self-attestation is valid only as it directs to the divine encounter.
   - The church’s recognition of the canon is an act of faith in the Spirit’s guidance, not a guarantee of objective authority.
   - "The Bible is not itself revelation, but the witness to revelation." (Truth as Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to the **authority of Scripture** significantly shaped modern Protestant theology, especially within the **neo-orthodox** tradition. His emphasis on the **event-character of revelation** and the necessity of the Holy Spirit challenged both liberal and fundamentalist views of biblical authority. While his views were often contrasted with those of Karl Barth, Brunner’s insistence on the existential encounter with the Word remains influential in discussions of **Scripture’s self-attestation** and authority. His work continues to provoke debate on the relationship between the Bible, revelation, and the living Christ.
