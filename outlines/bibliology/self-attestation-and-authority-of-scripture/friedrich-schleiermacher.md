# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the **authority of Scripture** by grounding it in the **Christian community’s experience of faith** rather than in self-attestation or external proofs. He emphasized the **religious consciousness** and the role of the **church** in recognizing and transmitting the Bible’s significance, thus shifting the locus of authority from the text itself to the **feeling of absolute dependence** and communal reception.

- "The church is the preserver and transmitter of the documents in which the original Christian self-consciousness is deposited." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Hermeneutics: The Handwritten Manuscripts
- Christian Ethics

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority is Mediated by the Church**
   - The Bible’s status arises from its role in expressing the original Christian experience.
   - The **church** determines the canon and preserves Scripture’s authority.
   - Authority is not inherent in the text but in its function within the faith community.
   - The church’s ongoing life validates and interprets Scripture.
   - "The canon is a product of the church, not the church a product of the canon." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Revelation as Religious Consciousness**
   - Revelation is primarily the self-consciousness of Christ, not a set of propositions.
   - Scripture witnesses to this consciousness but is not identical with revelation itself.
   - The authority of Scripture is derivative, rooted in its connection to the original experience of Christ.
   - Faith is a matter of **feeling** or immediate self-awareness, not assent to external authority.
   - "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Rejection of Self-Attestation of Scripture**
   - Scripture does not possess self-evident authority apart from the community’s recognition.
   - The concept of **self-attestation** is replaced by communal validation and historical continuity.
   - The Bible’s authority is not a priori but emerges from its formative role in Christian piety.
   - The church’s experience is the criterion for recognizing Scripture’s value.
   - "The faith of the individual is only possible within the faith of the community." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Hermeneutics and Historical Criticism**
   - Understanding Scripture requires historical and psychological interpretation.
   - The meaning of the text is accessed through empathy with its original context.
   - Authority is clarified through critical engagement, not mere acceptance.
   - Hermeneutics bridges the gap between ancient text and contemporary faith.
   - "Every interpretation is an attempt to understand an utterance as well as, and even better than, its author." (Hermeneutics)

5. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
   - The foundation of theology is the **feeling of absolute dependence** on God.
   - Scripture is authoritative as it mediates and expresses this experience.
   - Doctrines and texts are secondary to the immediacy of religious feeling.
   - The authority of the Bible is functional, serving the cultivation of authentic faith.
   - "Religion is to be regarded as a life, an original experience of the soul." (On Religion)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to the **authority of Scripture** profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, especially in its turn toward **subjectivity** and the **historical-critical method**. By grounding authority in the **religious consciousness** of the community, he challenged traditional notions of self-attestation and inspired later liberal and neo-orthodox theologians. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between **Scripture, tradition, and experience** within the church.
