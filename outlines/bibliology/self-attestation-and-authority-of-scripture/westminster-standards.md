# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture**, grounding the Bible’s authority not in the testimony of the church but in its own intrinsic qualities as the **Word of God**. They emphasize the internal witness of the **Holy Spirit** as the decisive means by which believers are convinced of Scripture’s divine origin and authority, while also affirming the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture for faith and life.

- "The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God." (Westminster Confession of Faith 1.4)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 1: "Of the Holy Scripture"
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 2–5
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 2–3
- The Westminster Assembly’s Minutes and Papers (ed. Chad Van Dixhoorn)
- The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century (ed. Ligon Duncan, et al.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority Is Intrinsic and Divine**
    - Scripture’s authority is not derived from the church or human testimony.
    - The Bible is authoritative because it is the **Word of God**.
    - God, as the author of Scripture, guarantees its truthfulness and binding authority.
    - The church’s role is to recognize, not confer, the authority of Scripture.
    - "The authority of the Holy Scripture... dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God..." (WCF 1.4)

2. **Self-Attestation of Scripture**
    - Scripture bears evidence within itself of its divine origin.
    - The majesty, purity, and unity of Scripture testify to its truth.
    - The harmony of all parts and the scope of the whole point to Christ.
    - Self-attestation is necessary because no higher authority exists to validate Scripture.
    - "Our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth... is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts." (WCF 1.5)

3. **Internal Testimony of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit convinces believers of the divine authority of Scripture.
    - This testimony is distinct from rational or historical arguments.
    - The Spirit’s witness is necessary for saving understanding and acceptance.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s truth comes through this inward work.
    - "The inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts." (WCF 1.5)

4. **Sufficiency and Clarity of Scripture**
    - All things necessary for salvation and faith are clearly set forth in Scripture.
    - Not everything in Scripture is equally plain, but essentials are accessible.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture excludes the need for new revelations.
    - The clarity of Scripture supports its authority and self-attestation.
    - "Those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded... that not only the learned, but the unlearned... may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them." (WCF 1.7)

5. **Scripture Interprets Scripture**
    - The infallible rule of interpretation is the Scripture itself.
    - Difficult passages are to be understood in light of clearer ones.
    - This principle safeguards the unity and authority of the biblical message.
    - It affirms that the meaning of Scripture is not subject to external authorities.
    - "The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself." (WCF 1.9)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped the **Reformed doctrine of Scripture**, especially regarding its self-attestation and ultimate authority. Their articulation of the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit remains foundational for Presbyterian and broader Reformed theology. By grounding the authority of Scripture in God himself and not in the church, the Standards have provided a bulwark against both rationalism and ecclesiastical authoritarianism. Their influence endures in confessional documents, theological education, and the ongoing defense of the sufficiency and clarity of the Bible.
