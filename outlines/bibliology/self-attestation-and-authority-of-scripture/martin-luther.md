# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther grounded the **authority of Scripture** in its intrinsic, **self-attesting character**, asserting that the Bible is the ultimate norm for faith and practice because it is the very **Word of God**. He rejected the notion that the **church** or **tradition** could stand as the final arbiter of Scripture’s authority, emphasizing the **internal witness of the Holy Spirit** as the means by which believers recognize Scripture’s divine origin.

- "The Word of God is self-authenticating; it cannot be established or proved by human authority." (WA 7:97)

## Key Works

- 95 Theses (1517)
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Preface to the New Testament (1522)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 33: Career of the Reformer III (especially “Concerning the Ministry”)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture Alone (Sola Scriptura)**
   - Scripture is the highest and only infallible authority for the church.
   - All doctrines and traditions must be judged by the standard of Scripture.
   - The church is created and continually reformed by the Word, not vice versa.
   - Human councils and popes are fallible and subordinate to Scripture.
   - "A simple layman armed with Scripture is to be believed above a pope or a council without it." (WA 7:97)

2. **Self-attestation of Scripture**
   - The Bible bears witness to its own divine origin through its content and power.
   - No external authority is needed to validate Scripture’s truthfulness.
   - The clarity and majesty of Scripture reveal its unique status as God’s Word.
   - The authority of Scripture is not derived from the church but from God Himself.
   - "Scripture is the true lord and master of all writings and doctrine on earth." (WA 7:98)

3. **Internal Witness of the Holy Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit convinces believers of the truth and authority of Scripture.
   - Faith in Scripture’s authority arises from the Spirit’s work, not rational proof.
   - The Spirit illumines the heart to recognize the voice of God in Scripture.
   - Assurance of Scripture’s authority is a spiritual, not merely intellectual, matter.
   - "Nobody who has not the Spirit of God sees a jot of what is in the Scriptures." (WA 18:606)

4. **Christocentric Interpretation**
   - Christ is the center and focus of all Scripture.
   - The authority of Scripture is tied to its testimony about Christ.
   - All interpretation must be governed by the gospel of Jesus Christ.
   - The clarity of Scripture is most evident in its witness to Christ.
   - "Take Christ from the Scriptures—and what more will you find in them?" (WA 46:414)

5. **Perspicuity (Clarity) of Scripture**
   - The essential teachings of Scripture are clear and accessible to all believers.
   - The Holy Spirit enables believers to understand the main message of Scripture.
   - Obscurities in Scripture do not undermine its authority or clarity in essentials.
   - The clarity of Scripture supports its self-authenticating authority.
   - "The Holy Scriptures are plain and clear in all matters that concern salvation." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s doctrine of the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** became foundational for the Protestant Reformation and shaped the development of **Reformed theology**. His insistence on **sola Scriptura** challenged the authority of the medieval church and redirected Christian theology to the primacy of the biblical text. Luther’s emphasis on the **internal witness of the Holy Spirit** and the clarity of Scripture continues to influence evangelical and confessional traditions, ensuring that the Bible remains central to faith and practice.
