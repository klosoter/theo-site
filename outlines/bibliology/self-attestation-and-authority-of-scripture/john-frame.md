# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame articulates a robust doctrine of the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture**, emphasizing that the Bible is authoritative because it is the very **Word of God** and testifies to its own divine origin. He integrates this with his **triperspectivalism**, arguing that the authority of Scripture is recognized through the interplay of **normative**, **situational**, and **existential** perspectives, and that the Spirit’s witness is essential for true conviction.

- "Scripture’s authority is not derived from the church, tradition, or human reason, but from God Himself, who speaks in Scripture and testifies to its truth." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Apologetics to the Glory of God (1994)
- "Presuppositional Apologetics" in Five Views on Apologetics (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority is Divine and Absolute**
    - The Bible’s authority is grounded in its identity as the **Word of God**.
    - No external authority (church, tradition, reason) stands above Scripture.
    - Scripture’s commands are binding on all people at all times.
    - The authority of Scripture is inseparable from the authority of God Himself.
    - "To disobey Scripture is to disobey God." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

2. **Self-Attestation of Scripture**
    - Scripture testifies to its own divine origin and reliability.
    - The Bible contains internal claims to inspiration and authority.
    - Self-attestation does not mean circular reasoning but is necessary for ultimate authorities.
    - The Spirit’s witness is required for believers to recognize Scripture’s self-attestation.
    - "The Bible is not only the Word of God but claims to be such, and its claim is justified by the Spirit’s witness." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

3. **Triperspectival Approach to Authority**
    - Authority is understood through the **normative** (God’s law), **situational** (facts), and **existential** (person) perspectives.
    - Each perspective is interdependent and necessary for a full understanding of authority.
    - The normative perspective highlights Scripture as the ultimate standard.
    - The situational and existential perspectives show how authority is recognized and applied.
    - "God’s lordship is expressed in his control, authority, and presence—each corresponding to a perspective on knowledge and authority." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

4. **Necessity of the Spirit’s Testimony**
    - Human reason alone cannot establish the authority of Scripture.
    - The Holy Spirit must illumine the mind and heart to recognize Scripture’s authority.
    - The Spirit’s testimony is not private revelation but an inward work confirming the truth of Scripture.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority is ultimately a gift of grace.
    - "The Spirit’s witness is not an additional source of revelation, but the means by which we are persuaded of Scripture’s truth." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Presuppositional Apologetics**
    - All reasoning is based on ultimate presuppositions; for Christians, Scripture is the foundational presupposition.
    - The authority of Scripture is defended by showing the impossibility of the contrary.
    - Apologetics must begin with and submit to the authority of God’s Word.
    - Rational arguments are subordinate to the self-authenticating nature of Scripture.
    - "The Christian must presuppose the truth of God’s Word in all reasoning, for there is no higher standard." (Apologetics to the Glory of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially through his integration of presuppositional apologetics and triperspectivalism. His work has influenced pastors, theologians, and apologists by emphasizing the necessity of the Spirit’s witness and the sufficiency of Scripture. Frame’s approach continues to be a touchstone for discussions on the nature of biblical authority and the epistemological foundations of Christian faith.
