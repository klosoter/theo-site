# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress upholds the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** as foundational to Christian epistemology, emphasizing that the Bible is its own ultimate standard and testifies to its divine origin. He integrates a **Trinitarian** and **multiperspectival** approach, arguing that the authority of Scripture is inseparable from the authority of God Himself, and that human knowledge is dependent on divine revelation.

- "The Bible’s authority is not derived from any human source, but from God himself, who speaks in Scripture." ("Inerrancy and Worldview")

## Key Works

- "Inerrancy and Worldview" (2012)
- "Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology" (1987)
- "The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses" (1991)
- "God-Centered Biblical Interpretation" (1999)
- "The Lordship of Christ: Serving Our Savior All of the Time, in All of Life, with All of Our Heart" (2016)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Self-Attestation**
    - Scripture testifies to its own divine origin and authority.
    - The Bible’s claims about itself are not circular but necessary for ultimate authority.
    - Human reason and experience are subordinate to Scripture’s testimony.
    - Self-attestation is rooted in the character of God as truthful and sovereign.
    - "The Bible claims to be the very word of God, and it is self-attesting in its authority." ("Inerrancy and Worldview")

2. **Trinitarian Foundation of Authority**
    - The authority of Scripture reflects the authority of the Triune God.
    - Revelation is a communicative act of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - The unity and diversity within the Trinity are mirrored in the unity and diversity of Scripture.
    - The Spirit’s witness is essential for recognizing Scripture’s authority.
    - "The authority of the Bible is ultimately the authority of the triune God who speaks." ("God-Centered Biblical Interpretation")

3. **Multiperspectival Epistemology**
    - Knowledge of Scripture’s authority involves normative, situational, and existential perspectives.
    - No single human perspective is exhaustive; all must be integrated.
    - Multiperspectivalism guards against reductionism in understanding revelation.
    - This approach highlights the coherence and richness of biblical authority.
    - "We need to recognize that our knowledge is always perspectival, but God’s word is the standard." ("Symphonic Theology")

4. **Inerrancy as a Corollary of Authority**
    - Inerrancy is inseparable from the self-attesting authority of Scripture.
    - The truthfulness of God guarantees the truthfulness of His Word.
    - Challenges to inerrancy are ultimately challenges to God’s character.
    - Inerrancy is not a modern invention but a historic Christian conviction.
    - "If the Bible is God’s word, it must be wholly true, for God cannot lie." ("Inerrancy and Worldview")

5. **Necessity of the Spirit’s Testimony**
    - The Holy Spirit enables believers to recognize Scripture’s authority.
    - Without the Spirit, human beings suppress or distort the truth of Scripture.
    - The inward witness of the Spirit is not subjective but grounded in God’s promise.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority is a work of grace, not autonomous reason.
    - "The Spirit works in us so that we acknowledge the divine authority of the Bible." ("God-Centered Biblical Interpretation")

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed epistemology** by articulating a robust doctrine of the self-attestation and authority of Scripture, rooted in a Trinitarian and multiperspectival framework. His work has influenced evangelical approaches to **biblical inerrancy**, hermeneutics, and the relationship between faith and reason. Poythress’s integration of philosophy, theology, and biblical studies continues to inform debates on the nature of **revelation** and the foundations of Christian knowledge.
