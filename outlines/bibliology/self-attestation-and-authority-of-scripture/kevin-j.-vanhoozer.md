# Kevin Vanhoozer (1957–)

Kevin Vanhoozer emphasizes the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** within the framework of **theological hermeneutics**, arguing that Scripture’s authority is rooted in its status as the communicative act of the triune God. He maintains that the Bible’s self-authenticating character is discerned through the Spirit’s work in the interpretive community, and that **canonical interpretation** is essential for recognizing Scripture’s divine voice.

- "Scripture is not simply a witness to revelation but is itself the communicative act of God." (The Drama of Doctrine)

## Key Works

- The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical-Linguistic Approach to Christian Theology
- First Theology: God, Scripture & Hermeneutics
- Remythologizing Theology: Divine Action, Passion, and Authorship
- Is There a Meaning in This Text? The Bible, the Reader, and the Morality of Literary Knowledge
- Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (editor)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Divine Speech-Act**
    - Scripture is the primary means by which God communicates with his people.
    - The Bible’s authority is grounded in its status as God’s performative utterance.
    - Understanding Scripture requires attention to its illocutionary force (what God is doing in speaking).
    - The Spirit enables the church to recognize and respond to God’s communicative action in Scripture.
    - "The Bible is the covenantal means by which God addresses and transforms his people." (The Drama of Doctrine)

2. **Self-Attestation of Scripture**
    - Scripture testifies to its own divine origin and authority.
    - The self-authenticating nature of Scripture is recognized through the Spirit’s witness.
    - The authority of Scripture does not depend on external validation but on its own testimony.
    - The church’s recognition of the canon is a response to Scripture’s intrinsic authority.
    - "Scripture’s authority is not imposed from without but acknowledged from within the community of faith." (First Theology)

3. **Canonical Hermeneutics**
    - The canon is the normative context for interpreting Scripture’s meaning and authority.
    - Canonical interpretation guards against subjective or relativistic readings.
    - The unity and diversity of Scripture are held together within the canonical framework.
    - The canon shapes the church’s theological imagination and doctrinal formulations.
    - "The canon is the script for the church’s ongoing performance of the drama of redemption." (The Drama of Doctrine)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit illumines the text and enables believers to perceive its divine authority.
    - The Spirit’s work is essential for proper interpretation and application of Scripture.
    - The Spirit creates and sustains the interpretive community (the church).
    - Recognition of Scripture’s authority is ultimately a pneumatic event.
    - "The Spirit is the primary agent in the communicative process between God and the church." (Remythologizing Theology)

5. **Authority in the Context of the Church**
    - The church is the interpretive community that receives and responds to Scripture’s authority.
    - Doctrinal development is rooted in faithful interpretation of the biblical canon.
    - The authority of Scripture is exercised through its formative role in shaping the church’s life and doctrine.
    - The church’s confessions and traditions are subordinate to the supreme authority of Scripture.
    - "The church’s task is to perform the script of Scripture faithfully, under the direction of the divine Author." (The Drama of Doctrine)

## Legacy and Impact

Vanhoozer’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the **authority of Scripture**, especially in relation to postmodern hermeneutics and the doctrine of self-attestation. His emphasis on **canonical-linguistic interpretation** and the communicative action of God has provided a robust framework for understanding Scripture’s unique status in the life of the church. Vanhoozer’s approach continues to influence evangelical theology, particularly in debates over biblical authority, interpretation, and the role of the church as the interpretive community.
