# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin grounded the **authority of Scripture** in its **self-attestation**, insisting that the Bible is authenticated not by external proofs but by the **internal witness of the Holy Spirit**. For Calvin, the **divine origin** of Scripture is recognized by believers through this inward testimony, making Scripture **autopistos** (self-authenticating) and the ultimate standard for faith and life.

- "Scripture indeed is self-authenticated; hence it is not right to subject it to proof and reasoning." (Institutes of the Christian Religion 1.7.5)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 6–10)
- Commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans
- Commentary on 2 Timothy
- Treatises Against the Anabaptists and Against the Libertines
- John Calvin: A Sixteenth-Century Portrait by William J. Bouwsma (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is self-authenticating (autopistos)**
   - The authority of Scripture does not depend on the church or human approval.
   - Scripture bears its own marks of divinity, evident in its majesty and content.
   - The truth of Scripture is recognized by those illumined by the Spirit.
   - External evidences are secondary and subordinate to Scripture’s own testimony.
   - "The highest proof of Scripture derives in general from the fact that God in person speaks in it." (Institutes 1.7.4)

2. **The internal witness of the Holy Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit convinces believers of the divine origin of Scripture.
   - Faith in Scripture’s authority is not a product of rational argument alone.
   - The Spirit’s testimony is necessary for certainty and assurance.
   - This inward persuasion is distinct from mere intellectual assent.
   - "The testimony of the Spirit is more excellent than all reason." (Institutes 1.7.4)

3. **Scripture’s authority is intrinsic, not derived**
   - The church recognizes, but does not confer, the authority of Scripture.
   - Councils and traditions are subordinate to the Word of God.
   - The authority of Scripture is grounded in its divine authorship.
   - Human institutions are fallible, but Scripture remains infallible.
   - "The church is built upon the foundation of the prophets and apostles." (Institutes 1.7.2)

4. **Scripture as the final norm for faith and practice**
   - All doctrines and practices must be tested by Scripture.
   - No revelation or tradition can supersede the authority of the Bible.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture is essential for the purity of the church.
   - Scripture is the supreme judge in all theological controversies.
   - "Nothing is left for us to do but to obey." (Institutes 1.7.1)

5. **The clarity and perspicuity of Scripture**
   - The essential teachings of Scripture are clear and accessible to believers.
   - Difficult passages are interpreted in light of clearer ones.
   - The Spirit aids believers in understanding the message of Scripture.
   - The clarity of Scripture supports its role as the final authority.
   - "God has so regulated the Scriptures that... nothing necessary is omitted." (Institutes 2.7.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of the **self-attestation of Scripture** became foundational for the Reformed tradition, shaping confessional standards such as the Westminster Confession of Faith. His emphasis on the **internal witness of the Holy Spirit** influenced later Protestant thought on the nature of faith and assurance. Calvin’s teaching continues to inform debates on **biblical authority**, providing a robust theological basis for the sufficiency and supremacy of Scripture in the life of the church.
