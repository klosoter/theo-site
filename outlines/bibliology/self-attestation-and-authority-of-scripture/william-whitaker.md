# William Whitaker (1548–1595)

William Whitaker was a leading English Reformed theologian who vigorously defended the **self-attestation** and **supreme authority of Scripture** against Roman Catholic claims of ecclesiastical authority. He argued that **Scripture is autopistos**—possessing inherent credibility and authority—because it is the very Word of God, and that the **Holy Spirit** internally confirms its truth to believers. Whitaker’s polemics established a foundational Protestant understanding of **Scripture’s sufficiency** and **clarity**.

- "The Scripture is not authentic because the church approves it, but because it is inspired by God." (Disputation on Holy Scripture)

## Key Works

- Disputation on Holy Scripture (1588)
- A Disputation on the Holy Scripture Against the Papists, Especially Bellarmine and Stapleton (1849 English translation)
- Praelectiones Theologicae
- Works cited in Richard Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is autopistos (self-authenticating)**
    - Scripture’s authority derives from its divine origin, not from the church.
    - The marks of divinity within Scripture (majesty, harmony, efficacy) testify to its truth.
    - The church recognizes, but does not confer, the authority of Scripture.
    - The self-attestation of Scripture is necessary to avoid circular reasoning regarding its authority.
    - "The authority of the Scripture depends not upon the testimony of the church, but upon itself." (Disputation on Holy Scripture)

2. **The Holy Spirit’s internal testimony**
    - The Spirit convinces believers of Scripture’s divine origin.
    - This internal witness is distinct from rational or external proofs.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority is ultimately a spiritual, not merely intellectual, matter.
    - The Spirit’s testimony is necessary due to human blindness and sin.
    - "The Holy Spirit so persuades our minds that we cannot doubt that the Scriptures are from God." (Disputation on Holy Scripture)

3. **Scripture’s sufficiency and clarity**
    - Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation and faith.
    - Its essential teachings are clear, even if some passages are obscure.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture stands in contrast to the Roman Catholic appeal to tradition.
    - The clarity of Scripture is accessible to all believers, not just clergy.
    - "Scripture is so plain in things necessary, that it may be understood by all." (Disputation on Holy Scripture)

4. **Rejection of ecclesiastical infallibility**
    - The church is a witness and keeper of Scripture, not its judge.
    - Councils and traditions are subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
    - The infallibility of the church is denied in favor of the infallibility of the Word.
    - The church’s authority is ministerial, not magisterial, regarding Scripture.
    - "The church is the keeper, not the judge, of Holy Scripture." (Disputation on Holy Scripture)

5. **Use of external evidences and reason**
    - External evidences (antiquity, miracles, fulfillment of prophecy) support, but do not ground, Scripture’s authority.
    - Rational arguments can confirm, but not establish, the divine authority of Scripture.
    - The ultimate ground of faith is the Word itself, not human testimony or reason.
    - Apologetic arguments are useful for refuting opponents and strengthening believers.
    - "We do not reject the use of arguments, but we do not rest our faith upon them." (Disputation on Holy Scripture)

## Legacy and Impact

Whitaker’s robust defense of the **self-attestation of Scripture** became a cornerstone of Reformed and Protestant bibliology, shaping later confessional statements such as the Westminster Confession of Faith. His polemical engagement with Roman Catholic theologians clarified the distinction between **Scripture and tradition** for generations of English-speaking Protestants. Whitaker’s articulation of the Spirit’s internal testimony influenced subsequent Reformed theologians and remains a key reference in debates on the authority and sufficiency of Scripture.
