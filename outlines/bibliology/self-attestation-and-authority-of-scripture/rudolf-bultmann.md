# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He rejected the notion of Scripture possessing inherent, objective authority, instead emphasizing that its significance emerges as it confronts the individual with the **kerygma**—the proclamation of Christ—eliciting an existential response of faith.

- "It is not the biblical text as such that is authoritative, but the event to which it witnesses and which is made present in the proclamation." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
   - Scripture contains mythological elements shaped by ancient worldviews.
   - The task is to interpret these myths existentially, not to accept them as literal history.
   - Demythologization seeks the existential truth behind the mythic language.
   - The authority of Scripture lies in its existential message, not its factual claims.
   - "What matters is not the mythological world picture but the existential understanding of human existence." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Authority Rooted in Kerygma**
   - The **kerygma**—the proclamation of Christ—constitutes the core of Scripture’s authority.
   - Authority is not inherent in the text but in the event it proclaims.
   - The Word becomes authoritative as it encounters and addresses the hearer.
   - Faith is a response to the kerygma, not to the letter of Scripture.
   - "The word of preaching confronts me here and now as the word of God." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Existential Interpretation**
   - Scripture must be interpreted through the lens of existential philosophy, especially Heidegger.
   - The Bible’s authority is realized when it addresses the individual’s existence.
   - Objective, propositional authority is replaced by personal, existential encounter.
   - The meaning of Scripture is actualized in the present moment of decision.
   - "The real question is not what the text meant, but what it means for me." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Rejection of Objective Inerrancy**
   - Bultmann denies the traditional doctrine of **inerrancy**.
   - He views the Bible as a human document shaped by its historical context.
   - Errors and contradictions do not undermine its existential message.
   - The authority of Scripture is not dependent on factual accuracy.
   - "The Bible is not a collection of oracles but a witness to revelation." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Scripture as Witness, Not Revelation Itself**
   - Scripture points to the event of revelation but is not itself revelation.
   - The text is a human testimony to the divine event in Christ.
   - Its authority is derivative, grounded in the encounter with the risen Christ.
   - The Spirit actualizes the witness of Scripture in the present.
   - "Scripture is not revelation, but the witness to revelation." (History and Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **authority of Scripture** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **existentialist interpretation** and **hermeneutics**. His emphasis on demythologization challenged traditional views of biblical authority and inspired both sharp criticism and creative engagement. While many in the Reformed tradition reject his conclusions, Bultmann’s insistence on the existential encounter with the kerygma continues to influence debates about the nature and function of Scripture in the church.
