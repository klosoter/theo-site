# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas affirmed the **authority of Scripture** as the highest norm for Christian doctrine, grounding its certainty in its origin from **divine revelation**. While Aquinas did not use the terminology of **self-attestation** as later Reformed theologians would, he maintained that **Scripture’s authority** ultimately rests on God Himself, not on the Church, even though the Church serves as a ministerial witness to its authenticity.

- "The authority of the canonical Scriptures is greater than that of all the Church’s teachers." (Summa Theologiae, I, q.1, a.8, ad 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I, q.1)
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- Expositio super Job ad litteram (Commentary on Job)
- De Veritate

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture derives authority from God as its author**
    - Scripture is **inspired** by God, who is its principal author.
    - The truth of Scripture is infallible because it proceeds from **divine revelation**.
    - Human authors are **instrumental causes** under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
    - The certainty of faith in Scripture is grounded in God’s veracity, not in human testimony.
    - "We believe the doctrines of faith, not because of human reason, but because of the authority of God who reveals them." (Summa Theologiae, II-II, q.1, a.5)

2. **The Church as ministerial, not magisterial, in relation to Scripture**
    - The Church recognizes and transmits the **canon of Scripture**.
    - The Church’s authority is subordinate to the authority of Scripture itself.
    - The Church does not confer authority on Scripture but bears witness to it.
    - The **magisterium** serves to interpret, not to establish, the authority of the biblical text.
    - "The Church receives its authority from Christ, but the authority of Scripture is from God Himself." (Summa Theologiae, I, q.1, a.8, ad 2)

3. **Faith is grounded in divine testimony**
    - The assent of faith is due to the authority of God who speaks in Scripture.
    - **Faith** is not based on rational demonstration but on the divine source of revelation.
    - The certainty of faith surpasses all human knowledge because of its divine foundation.
    - Miracles and prophecies serve as external motives of credibility, but do not replace the authority of God.
    - "Faith rests on the revelation made to the Apostles and Prophets who wrote the canonical books." (Summa Theologiae, II-II, q.1, a.6)

4. **Scripture’s clarity and sufficiency for salvation**
    - All things necessary for salvation are contained in **Sacred Scripture**.
    - The essential truths are presented clearly, though some passages remain obscure.
    - The Holy Spirit illumines the understanding of Scripture for believers.
    - Tradition and the Church assist in interpretation but do not add new revelation.
    - "In Holy Scripture, all things necessary for faith are delivered with sufficient clarity." (Summa Theologiae, I, q.1, a.10)

5. **Distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic proofs of authority**
    - The **intrinsic authority** of Scripture comes from its divine origin.
    - **Extrinsic proofs** (miracles, Church testimony) confirm but do not establish this authority.
    - The ultimate reason for believing Scripture is the truthfulness of God.
    - Human arguments are useful for defending faith but not for its foundation.
    - "The authority of the divine Scriptures surpasses the authority of the Church." (Summa Theologiae, I, q.1, a.8, ad 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s articulation of the **authority of Scripture** shaped medieval and later Catholic theology, emphasizing the primacy of **divine revelation** and the subordinate role of the Church. His distinction between the intrinsic authority of Scripture and the Church’s ministerial function influenced debates on the canon and the nature of faith. While Aquinas did not develop a doctrine of **self-attestation** in the Reformed sense, his insistence on God as the ultimate ground of Scriptural authority provided a foundation for later theological reflection on the topic. His synthesis continues to inform both Catholic and ecumenical discussions of biblical authority.
