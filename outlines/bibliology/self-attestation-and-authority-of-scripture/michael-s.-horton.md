# Michael Horton (1964– )

Michael Horton emphasizes the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** as foundational to Reformed theology, insisting that Scripture is authoritative not because of external validation but by virtue of its own divine origin and testimony. He maintains that the **Holy Spirit** authenticates Scripture’s authority to the believer, grounding certainty in the **internal witness** rather than in ecclesiastical or rational proofs.

- "Scripture is not authoritative because the church says so, but because God speaks through it and the Spirit testifies to its truth." (The Christian Faith)

- People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology
- Covenant and Eschatology: The Divine Drama
- God of Promise: Introducing Covenant Theology
- Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Self-Attestation**
    - Scripture bears witness to its own divine origin and authority.
    - The authority of Scripture is not dependent on human or ecclesiastical endorsement.
    - The self-authenticating nature of Scripture is rooted in its content and character as God’s Word.
    - The Reformed tradition upholds that Scripture’s testimony about itself is sufficient for faith.
    - "The Bible’s authority is intrinsic, not extrinsic, grounded in its own testimony as the Word of God." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Certainty**
    - The Holy Spirit convinces believers of the truth and authority of Scripture.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority comes through the Spirit’s internal witness, not external arguments.
    - The Spirit’s work is necessary for the heart and mind to be persuaded of Scripture’s divine origin.
    - This internal testimony is distinct from rational or historical evidences.
    - "It is the Spirit who enables us to recognize Scripture as God’s Word, not merely historical investigation." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Distinction from Roman Catholic and Rationalist Views**
    - Horton rejects the idea that the church confers authority upon Scripture.
    - He critiques rationalist approaches that make human reason the final arbiter of biblical authority.
    - The Reformed position maintains that Scripture’s authority is prior to and independent of both church and reason.
    - The church is a witness and servant of the Word, not its source.
    - "The church does not create the canon; it receives and recognizes it." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Covenantal Context of Revelation**
    - God’s self-revelation in Scripture is covenantal, binding God and his people.
    - The authority of Scripture is inseparable from its role in the covenant relationship.
    - The covenant framework shapes how Scripture is received and understood as authoritative.
    - Revelation is always personal and relational, not abstract or impersonal.
    - "God’s Word comes to us in the context of covenant, calling for faith and obedience." (Covenant and Eschatology)

5. **Sufficiency and Clarity of Scripture**
    - Scripture is sufficient for faith and life, containing all things necessary for salvation.
    - The clarity (perspicuity) of Scripture means its essential message is accessible to believers.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture is tied to its self-attesting character and divine authority.
    - Tradition and reason serve Scripture, but do not supplement or override its authority.
    - "Scripture is clear and sufficient, providing all that is necessary for our knowledge of God and salvation." (Pilgrim Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Horton has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture**, especially in relation to the work of the **Holy Spirit** and the covenantal context of revelation. His writings have reinforced the classic Reformed position against both ecclesiastical and rationalist challenges, emphasizing the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture. Horton’s influence is evident in both academic and church settings, where his articulation of these doctrines continues to inform and equip pastors, theologians, and laypeople.
