# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos upheld the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** as foundational to **Reformed theology**, insisting that the Bible is authoritative because it is the very **Word of God**. He argued that Scripture’s authority is not derived from the church or external evidences, but from its own intrinsic **divine character** and the internal testimony of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "The testimony which Scripture bears to itself is not a mere subjective impression, but the objective witness of God to His own Word." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "The Doctrine of Revelation in the Old Testament"
- "The Self-Testimony of Jesus to the Scriptures"
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority Is Intrinsic**
    - Scripture possesses authority by virtue of being **God-breathed**.
    - Its authority is not conferred by the church or tradition.
    - The divine origin of Scripture grounds its binding character.
    - The authority of Scripture is absolute and not subject to human judgment.
    - "The authority of Scripture rests in its being the Word of God, not in any external attestation." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Self-Attestation of Scripture**
    - Scripture testifies to its own divine origin and trustworthiness.
    - The self-witness of Scripture is objective, not merely subjective.
    - This self-attestation is necessary due to the unique nature of divine revelation.
    - The Bible’s claims about itself are integral to its function as revelation.
    - "Scripture is self-attesting because it is the revelation of God, who can swear by no one greater." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Certainty**
    - The **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** is essential for recognizing Scripture’s authority.
    - The Spirit convinces believers of the truth and divinity of Scripture.
    - This testimony is not a new revelation but illumination of what is already present in Scripture.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority is ultimately a spiritual, not merely rational, matter.
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who opens the eyes of faith to see the divine character of Scripture." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

4. **Rejection of External Grounding**
    - Vos denied that historical, rational, or ecclesiastical proofs can serve as the ultimate ground for Scripture’s authority.
    - External evidences may confirm but never establish the authority of the Bible.
    - The church recognizes, but does not create, the canon of Scripture.
    - True certainty about Scripture’s authority comes only from God’s own testimony.
    - "No external authority can stand above the Word of God to judge or validate it." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

5. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
    - Scripture’s authority is tied to its unified, organic character as God’s redemptive revelation.
    - The Old and New Testaments together form a coherent, divinely authored whole.
    - The unity of Scripture supports its self-attesting nature.
    - The organic development of revelation underscores the reliability and authority of the biblical canon.
    - "The unity of revelation is the unity of the self-revealing God, and thus the unity of Scripture’s authority." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust articulation of the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** has profoundly shaped confessional Reformed theology and biblical studies. His emphasis on the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** and the organic unity of revelation continues to influence contemporary discussions on the doctrine of Scripture. Vos’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment of Reformed theologians to uphold the Bible’s divine authority as self-authenticating and foundational for all theology.
