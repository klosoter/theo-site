# Benjamin B. Warfield (1851–1921)

Benjamin B. Warfield was a leading defender of the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** within the Reformed tradition. He argued that the Bible is authoritative because it is the very **Word of God**, possessing an intrinsic **divine authority** that is recognized through the internal testimony of the **Holy Spirit** rather than external validation.

- "The Bible, thus, is not dependent on the testimony of men, of the Church, or of reason, for its authority." ("The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible")

## Key Works

- The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible
- Revelation and Inspiration
- Calvin and the Holy Scripture
- The Westminster Assembly and Its Work
- Selected Shorter Writings (esp. essays on Scripture)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Self-Attestation**
   - Scripture bears witness to its own **divine origin** and authority.
   - The authority of the Bible is not derived from the church or tradition.
   - Self-attestation is rooted in the Bible’s unique character as the Word of God.
   - The recognition of this authority is enabled by the Holy Spirit.
   - "The Scriptures bear on their face the indubitable marks of their divine origin." (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)

2. **Internal Testimony of the Holy Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit enables believers to recognize Scripture’s authority.
   - This testimony is necessary due to human sin and blindness.
   - The Spirit’s work is distinct from rational or historical proofs.
   - Assurance of Scripture’s truth comes from this inward witness.
   - "It is the Holy Spirit in us who authenticates to us the Scriptures as the Word of God." (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)

3. **Objective Divine Authority**
   - The Bible’s authority is objective, not contingent on human response.
   - Scripture is authoritative because it is God’s Word, regardless of acceptance.
   - The church’s role is to recognize, not confer, this authority.
   - Warfield rejects subjectivism in determining canonicity.
   - "The authority of the Scriptures is not a thing to be created by the verdict of men, but to be recognized by them." (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)

4. **Organic Inspiration**
   - Inspiration is a dynamic, organic process, not mechanical dictation.
   - Human authors were fully engaged, yet superintended by the Spirit.
   - This ensures both the divine and human aspects of Scripture.
   - The result is a fully trustworthy and authoritative text.
   - "The Scriptures are the product of divine inspiration, organically given through human authors." (Revelation and Inspiration)

5. **Reformed Confessionalism**
   - Warfield aligns with the **Westminster Confession** on Scripture’s authority.
   - He upholds the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture for faith and life.
   - The confessions articulate the church’s recognition of Scripture’s self-attestation.
   - He sees confessional standards as faithful summaries, not sources, of authority.
   - "The Confession does not make the Scriptures authoritative; it confesses their authority." (The Westminster Assembly and Its Work)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** shaped twentieth-century evangelical and Reformed thought, especially in debates over **inerrancy** and biblical authority. His articulation of the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit remains foundational for Reformed bibliology. Warfield’s influence endures in confessional statements and in the ongoing defense of the objective, divine authority of Scripture within the church and academy.
