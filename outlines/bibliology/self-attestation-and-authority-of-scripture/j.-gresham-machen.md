# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen vigorously defended the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** against the encroachments of theological liberalism. He insisted that **Scripture** is not dependent on external validation but is authoritative by virtue of its own divine origin, and that the **Holy Spirit** testifies to its truth in the hearts of believers. Machen’s approach was rooted in the **Reformed doctrine of revelation**, emphasizing the objective reality and sufficiency of the **Word of God**.

- "The Bible is not simply a record of revelation; it is itself a part of the revelation." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Key Works

- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- The Origin of Paul's Religion (1921)
- The Christian Faith in the Modern World (1936)
- What is Faith? (1925)
- The Virgin Birth of Christ (1930)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Self-Attestation**
    - Scripture bears witness to its own divine origin and authority.
    - The authority of Scripture is not grounded in the church or tradition.
    - The Bible’s claims about itself are central to its role in the Christian faith.
    - Self-attestation is inseparable from the work of the Holy Spirit.
    - "The Scriptures themselves claim to be the Word of God, and that claim is not to be taken lightly." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Objective Authority of the Word**
    - The authority of Scripture is objective and not subject to human opinion.
    - Scripture stands as the final arbiter in matters of faith and doctrine.
    - The authority of the Bible is rooted in its divine authorship.
    - Machen rejected any relativizing of biblical authority by modernist theology.
    - "The Christian man finds in the Bible the very Word of God, and that Word is supreme." (Christianity and Liberalism)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Testimony**
    - The Holy Spirit testifies internally to the truth of Scripture.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority comes through the Spirit’s work in believers.
    - The Spirit’s testimony is necessary for true conviction of Scripture’s divine nature.
    - This inward testimony does not create authority but confirms it.
    - "It is by the inward work of the Spirit that we become convinced of the Bible’s truth." (The Christian Faith in the Modern World)

4. **Rejection of Rationalistic Foundations**
    - Machen opposed grounding Scripture’s authority in historical or rational proofs alone.
    - He argued that reason is subordinate to revelation.
    - Apologetics serves to remove obstacles, not to establish ultimate authority.
    - Faith rests on the self-authenticating character of Scripture, not external validation.
    - "Faith does not proceed from demonstration, but from the testimony of the Spirit." (What is Faith?)

5. **Scripture as the Foundation of Doctrine**
    - All Christian doctrine must be derived from and tested by Scripture.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture is essential for the church’s teaching and life.
    - Machen insisted on the primacy of the Bible over tradition or ecclesiastical pronouncements.
    - Doctrinal integrity depends on unwavering commitment to biblical authority.
    - "Christianity is based upon a book, and that book is the Bible." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s robust defense of the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** shaped the contours of twentieth-century American Reformed theology, especially in the face of modernist challenges. His work laid the groundwork for the formation of Westminster Theological Seminary and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, both committed to the primacy of the **Word of God**. Machen’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about biblical authority, inspiring generations to uphold the sufficiency and divine origin of Scripture.
