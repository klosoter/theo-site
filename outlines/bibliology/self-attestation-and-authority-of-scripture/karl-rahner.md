# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** through his broader framework of **transcendental theology** and **revelation**. He emphasized that **Scripture** is authoritative as the normative witness to **God’s self-communication**, but its authority is recognized within the **Church’s living tradition** and the existential openness of the human subject to divine revelation.

- "Scripture is the original document of the Church’s faith, but it is only in the Church that its full meaning is disclosed." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Foundations of Christian Faith
- Inspiration in the Bible (Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)
- The Dynamic Element in the Church
- Revelation and Tradition (Theological Investigations, Vol. 6)
- Theological Investigations (multi-volume collection)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as God’s Self-Communication**
   - Revelation is not merely propositional but the personal self-gift of God to humanity.
   - **Scripture** witnesses to this self-communication, but is not identical with revelation itself.
   - The authority of Scripture is grounded in its role as the normative record of God’s self-revelation.
   - Human openness to transcendence is the condition for receiving revelation.
   - "Revelation is God’s free self-communication, which is accepted in faith." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Scripture within the Church’s Tradition**
   - The **Church** is the original context in which Scripture is received and interpreted.
   - The authority of Scripture is inseparable from the living tradition of the Church.
   - The canon of Scripture is recognized through the Church’s Spirit-guided discernment.
   - The meaning of Scripture unfolds in the ongoing life of the believing community.
   - "Scripture and tradition are not two sources but one single source of revelation." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 6)

3. **Inspiration as a Dynamic Process**
   - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but a dynamic, Spirit-guided process.
   - Human authors are true authors, shaped by their historical and cultural contexts.
   - The Spirit ensures that Scripture faithfully witnesses to God’s self-communication.
   - The authority of Scripture is rooted in this divine-human cooperation.
   - "Inspiration means that the human word becomes the word of God in the power of the Spirit." (Inspiration in the Bible)

4. **Faith and the Recognition of Authority**
   - The authority of Scripture is recognized through the act of faith, not external proofs.
   - Faith is itself a response to God’s self-communication, mediated through Scripture.
   - The self-attestation of Scripture is meaningful within the existential openness of the believer.
   - The Church’s faith precedes and enables the recognition of Scripture’s authority.
   - "The acceptance of Scripture as God’s word is an act of faith, not the result of historical demonstration." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Scripture’s Normativity and Limits**
   - Scripture is the normative witness to revelation, but not exhaustive of God’s self-communication.
   - The magisterium interprets Scripture authoritatively within the Church.
   - Tradition and ongoing experience of the Spirit complement the authority of Scripture.
   - The self-attestation of Scripture is always mediated by the Church’s faith and discernment.
   - "Scripture is the norm, but it is not the totality of revelation." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 6)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s approach to the **authority of Scripture** has profoundly shaped modern Catholic theology, especially in the context of **Vatican II** and its emphasis on revelation as God’s self-communication. His integration of **Scripture, tradition, and Church** has influenced ecumenical dialogues and contemporary understandings of biblical authority. Rahner’s transcendental method continues to inform discussions about the relationship between faith, revelation, and the recognition of Scripture’s unique status in the life of the Church.
