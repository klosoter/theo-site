# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin robustly defended the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** as foundational to Reformed theology. He argued that the **divine origin** of Scripture is recognized not by external proofs or the church’s testimony, but by the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** and the inherent qualities of the biblical text itself.

- "Scripture is autopistos, that is, credible in itself, on account of its own light and evidence, and does not depend on the authority of the church." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Holy Scripture: The Ground and Pillar of Our Faith (ed. R. Scott Clark, selections)
- Reformation and Scholasticism: An Ecumenical Enterprise (secondary, relevant for context)
- The Doctrine of Scripture: An Introduction (secondary, for modern analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is Autopistos (Self-Authenticating)**
    - Scripture possesses **intrinsic authority** due to its divine authorship.
    - Its truth does not rest on the church or human testimony.
    - The **self-attestation** of Scripture is grounded in its unique majesty, purity, and efficacy.
    - The recognition of Scripture’s authority is ultimately a spiritual, not merely rational, act.
    - "The Scriptures obtain their authority from themselves, not from the church." (Institutes)

2. **Internal Testimony of the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** convinces believers of the divine origin of Scripture.
    - This testimony is distinct from rational arguments or historical evidences.
    - The Spirit’s work is necessary for a saving, certain conviction of Scripture’s truth.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority is a supernatural gift, not a product of human reasoning.
    - "The principal cause of faith is the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit." (Institutes)

3. **Distinction Between Authority and Recognition**
    - The **authority** of Scripture is objective and prior to its recognition by the church.
    - The church’s role is to recognize, not to confer, canonical status.
    - The canon is established by God, not by ecclesiastical decree.
    - This distinction safeguards the **sufficiency** and **clarity** of Scripture.
    - "The authority of Scripture does not depend upon the church, but the church upon Scripture." (Institutes)

4. **Use of External Evidences**
    - External evidences (miracles, prophecy, antiquity) serve as secondary, ministerial aids.
    - These evidences are helpful for confirming faith, not for establishing authority.
    - Turretin valued apologetic arguments but subordinated them to **self-attestation**.
    - External proofs are persuasive but not determinative for faith.
    - "External arguments are not the foundation of faith, but its supports." (Institutes)

5. **Scripture’s Infallibility and Perfection**
    - Scripture is **infallible** and free from error in all it affirms.
    - Its perfection is rooted in its divine origin and purpose.
    - The Bible is the supreme and final standard for doctrine and life.
    - Turretin’s doctrine of infallibility undergirds his view of **self-attestation**.
    - "The Scriptures are the infallible rule of faith and practice." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** became a cornerstone for later Reformed confessions and systematic theologies. His careful distinction between the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** and external evidences shaped the classic Reformed doctrine of Scripture, influencing theologians such as Charles Hodge and B.B. Warfield. Turretin’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the **autopistos** nature of Scripture and the relationship between faith, reason, and revelation.
