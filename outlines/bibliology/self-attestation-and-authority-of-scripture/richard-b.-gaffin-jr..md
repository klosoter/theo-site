# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading voice in the Reformed tradition on the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture**. He emphasizes that **Scripture’s authority** is grounded in its divine origin and is recognized by the internal testimony of the **Holy Spirit**, rather than by external evidences or ecclesiastical endorsement.

- "The authority of Scripture is not derived from the church or any external source but is intrinsic, grounded in its identity as the Word of God." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

## Key Works

- God’s Word in Servant-Form: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck on the Doctrine of Scripture
- "The Holy Spirit and the Authority of Scripture" (in Inerrancy and Hermeneutic)
- "Westminster and the Scriptures" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- Resurrection and Redemption (for broader theological context)
- Articles in Westminster Theological Journal on revelation and authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority Is Intrinsic**
   - Scripture possesses **authority** because it is the very Word of God.
   - Its authority is not contingent upon human recognition or church declaration.
   - The church’s role is to receive and witness to Scripture’s authority, not to confer it.
   - This intrinsic authority is foundational for the Reformed doctrine of **sola Scriptura**.
   - "The church does not make the Bible the Word of God; it receives and confesses it as such." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

2. **Self-Attestation of Scripture**
   - Scripture testifies to its own divine origin and authority.
   - Self-attestation is not circular reasoning but a necessary implication of God’s self-revelation.
   - The Bible’s claims about itself are essential for understanding its function as revelation.
   - Self-attestation is inseparable from the work of the **Holy Spirit**.
   - "Scripture’s self-witness is not self-referential arrogance but the necessary corollary of its divine authorship." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

3. **Internal Testimony of the Holy Spirit**
   - The **Holy Spirit** enables believers to recognize and submit to Scripture’s authority.
   - This testimony is not a new revelation but an illumination of what is already present in Scripture.
   - Assurance of Scripture’s authority is ultimately a spiritual, not merely rational, conviction.
   - The Spirit’s witness is essential for the proper reception of the Bible as God’s Word.
   - "The internal testimony of the Holy Spirit is indispensable for the recognition of Scripture’s authority." (Inerrancy and Hermeneutic)

4. **Rejection of External Grounding**
   - Gaffin rejects the notion that historical, rational, or ecclesiastical proofs are the ultimate ground for Scripture’s authority.
   - Apologetics and evidences have a ministerial, not magisterial, role.
   - External supports may confirm but never establish the authority of Scripture.
   - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture are tied to its self-attesting character.
   - "No external authority can stand above Scripture to validate it as God’s Word." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

5. **Continuity with Reformed Confessions**
   - Gaffin aligns his views with the **Westminster Confession of Faith** and classic Reformed theology.
   - He stresses the confessional emphasis on Scripture’s self-authenticating nature.
   - The Reformed tradition’s doctrine of Scripture is both historically rooted and theologically robust.
   - Gaffin’s work seeks to retrieve and clarify these confessional commitments for the contemporary church.
   - "The Westminster Confession’s teaching on Scripture’s authority remains unsurpassed in its clarity and faithfulness." (Westminster and the Scriptures)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology and influenced generations of pastors and scholars at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. His insistence on the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit and the intrinsic authority of Scripture has provided a robust defense against both liberal and rationalistic challenges. Gaffin’s work continues to serve as a touchstone for those seeking a confessional and theologically grounded doctrine of Scripture.
