# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray upheld the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** as foundational to Reformed theology, emphasizing that Scripture is authoritative because it is the very **Word of God**. He argued that the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** is essential for recognizing Scripture’s divine authority, and that Scripture is self-authenticating, not dependent on external validation.

- "The witness which Scripture bears to itself and the witness borne by the Holy Spirit to Scripture are correlative and inseparable." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- "The Attestation of Scripture" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- "The Infallibility of Scripture" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- "The Authority of Scripture" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1942)
- Principles of Conduct (especially the introduction)
- Redemption Accomplished and Applied (relevant for his doctrine of revelation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Self-Attestation**
    - Scripture testifies to its own divine origin and authority.
    - The authority of Scripture is intrinsic, not derived from church or tradition.
    - Self-attestation is rooted in the nature of Scripture as the Word of God.
    - This testimony is objective, regardless of human response.
    - "The Bible claims for itself the unique prerogative of being the Word of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

2. **Internal Testimony of the Holy Spirit**
    - Recognition of Scripture’s authority requires the Spirit’s work in the heart.
    - The Spirit enables believers to perceive Scripture’s divine qualities.
    - This testimony is not a new revelation but illumination.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority is inseparable from the Spirit’s witness.
    - "It is only by the inward witness of the Holy Spirit that we are made infallibly assured of the divine origin and authority of Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

3. **Objective Authority of Scripture**
    - Scripture’s authority is not contingent on human acceptance.
    - The authority is grounded in God’s authorship.
    - All people are obligated to submit to Scripture’s commands and teachings.
    - The church’s recognition does not confer authority but acknowledges it.
    - "The authority of Scripture is not dependent upon our recognition; it is inherent in what Scripture is." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

4. **Unity of Word and Spirit**
    - The Spirit never works apart from the Word in granting assurance.
    - The Word and Spirit are mutually confirming in the believer’s experience.
    - The Spirit’s testimony is always to the content of Scripture.
    - This unity safeguards against subjectivism or rationalism.
    - "The testimony of the Spirit is not to be divorced from the testimony which Scripture bears to itself." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

5. **Rejection of External Ground for Authority**
    - Human reason or ecclesiastical authority cannot ground Scripture’s authority.
    - Apologetic arguments may support but never establish ultimate authority.
    - The Reformed position resists Roman Catholic and rationalist approaches.
    - True certainty comes only from God’s own testimony in Scripture.
    - "No authority, whether of the church or of reason, can be coordinate with or superior to the authority of Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. His insistence on the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** as essential for assurance of Scripture’s authority remains a hallmark of confessional Reformed theology. Murray’s careful exegesis and theological clarity continue to influence discussions on the doctrine of Scripture, providing a bulwark against both rationalist and ecclesiastical reductionism.
