# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** by emphasizing the dynamic relationship between **revelation**, **faith**, and the **witness of the Holy Spirit**. He rejected a purely formal or rationalistic grounding for **Scripture’s authority**, arguing instead that its self-attestation is inseparable from the reality of divine revelation and the responsive faith of the believer.

- "Scripture does not ask for our defense of its authority, but for our listening to its witness." (Holy Scripture, p. 238)

## Key Works

- Holy Scripture (De Heilige Schrift), Vols. 1–2
- Studies in Dogmatics: Holy Scripture
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Revelation
- General Revelation
- The Person of Christ

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority Rooted in Revelation**
   - Authority is not an abstract property but grounded in God’s self-disclosure.
   - The authority of Scripture is inseparable from the reality of **revelation**.
   - Scripture’s authority is not imposed externally but recognized in the act of faith.
   - The authority is not self-supporting apart from the God who speaks.
   - "The authority of Scripture is the authority of the divine revelation which comes to us in Scripture." (Holy Scripture, p. 242)

2. **Self-attestation as Witness, Not Proof**
   - Self-attestation is not a logical demonstration but a testimony to its divine origin.
   - Scripture’s witness is encountered, not deduced or proven by external criteria.
   - The self-attesting character is bound to the content and event of revelation.
   - Faith responds to the witness, not to an independent rational argument.
   - "Self-attestation is not a proof, but the witness of the Spirit in and through the Word." (Holy Scripture, p. 249)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Recognizing Authority**
   - The **Holy Spirit** enables the recognition of Scripture’s authority.
   - The Spirit’s testimony is internal and existential, not merely cognitive.
   - The authority of Scripture is confirmed in the life of the church through the Spirit.
   - The Spirit’s work is necessary for the self-attestation of the Word to be effective.
   - "Without the witness of the Spirit, the authority of Scripture remains unrecognized." (Holy Scripture, p. 251)

4. **Rejection of Rationalistic or Circular Arguments**
   - Berkouwer critiques attempts to ground authority in rational proofs or circular logic.
   - He warns against making self-attestation a formal, self-referential claim.
   - The authority of Scripture is not validated by human logic but by divine encounter.
   - Rationalistic approaches undermine the personal and revelatory character of Scripture.
   - "The authority of Scripture is not a product of logical necessity, but of the reality of revelation." (Holy Scripture, p. 245)

5. **Faith’s Response to Scripture’s Authority**
   - Faith is the proper response to the self-attesting Word.
   - The authority of Scripture is recognized in the act of obedient listening.
   - Faith is not a subjective creation but a response to the objective Word.
   - The church’s confession arises from hearing and receiving the Word in faith.
   - "Faith does not create authority, but acknowledges it as it is given in the Word." (Holy Scripture, p. 253)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced articulation of **self-attestation and authority** influenced Reformed theology by shifting the focus from abstract proofs to the dynamic interplay of **revelation**, **faith**, and the **Holy Spirit**. His work challenged both rationalistic apologetics and subjectivist tendencies, emphasizing the living encounter with God in Scripture. Berkouwer’s approach continues to shape discussions on the nature of biblical authority and the role of faith in recognizing the voice of God in the Word.
