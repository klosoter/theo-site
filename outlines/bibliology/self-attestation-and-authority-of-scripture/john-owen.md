# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen was a leading Puritan theologian who vigorously defended the **self-attestation** and **supreme authority of Scripture**. He argued that the **Holy Spirit** alone convinces believers of the divine origin of Scripture, making its authority independent of human testimony or ecclesiastical endorsement.

- "The authority of the Scripture is the authority of God himself, and that upon its own account, and not by virtue of the church or any other human testimony." (The Divine Original of the Scriptures)

## Key Works

- The Divine Original of the Scriptures
- Of the Integrity and Purity of the Hebrew and Greek Text
- The Reason of Faith
- Biblical Theology (ed. Kelly M. Kapic and Carl R. Trueman)
- A Brief Declaration and Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority is Intrinsic**
    - Scripture possesses **divine authority** by virtue of its origin in God.
    - No external institution, including the church, can confer or validate this authority.
    - The authority of Scripture is not dependent on tradition or human reasoning.
    - The **Word of God** stands as the ultimate standard for faith and obedience.
    - "The authority of the written word doth not depend upon the authority of the church." (The Divine Original of the Scriptures)

2. **Self-attestation by the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** testifies internally to the truth and authority of Scripture.
    - Believers are persuaded of Scripture’s divine origin through the Spirit’s work, not rational argument alone.
    - This inward testimony is distinct from external evidences or apologetic proofs.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority is a spiritual, not merely intellectual, conviction.
    - "It is the work of the Holy Ghost to enable us to discern and believe the divine authority of the Scriptures." (The Reason of Faith)

3. **Sufficiency and Perfection of Scripture**
    - Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation and godly living.
    - No further revelation or tradition is needed to supplement the Bible.
    - The **clarity** and completeness of Scripture are grounded in its divine authorship.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture is a safeguard against doctrinal corruption.
    - "The Holy Scripture is able to make us wise unto salvation, and is perfectly sufficient for that end." (The Divine Original of the Scriptures)

4. **Rejection of Ecclesiastical Mediation**
    - The church recognizes but does not establish the canon or authority of Scripture.
    - Owen opposes the Roman Catholic view that the church is the source of scriptural authority.
    - The **canon** is self-authenticating, discerned by the Spirit in the hearts of believers.
    - The authority of Scripture is not contingent upon ecclesiastical approval or tradition.
    - "The church is a witness, not a judge, of the Scriptures." (The Divine Original of the Scriptures)

5. **Objective and Subjective Grounds for Faith**
    - The objective ground of faith is the **divine nature** and content of Scripture itself.
    - The subjective ground is the Spirit’s inward work, granting assurance and conviction.
    - External evidences may support but never replace the Spirit’s testimony.
    - True faith rests on God’s authority as revealed in Scripture, not on human arguments.
    - "Faith rests ultimately on the authority of God speaking in the Scriptures by his Spirit." (The Reason of Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s robust defense of the **self-attestation** and **supreme authority of Scripture** shaped Reformed and Puritan approaches to **bibliology**. His insistence on the Spirit’s internal witness influenced later confessional standards and evangelical thought. Owen’s arguments continue to be cited in debates over the relationship between Scripture, tradition, and ecclesial authority, making him a foundational figure in the doctrine of **sola Scriptura**.
