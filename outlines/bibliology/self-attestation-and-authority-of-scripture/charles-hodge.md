# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge upheld the **self-attestation** and **authority of Scripture** as foundational to Reformed theology, emphasizing that the Bible is authoritative because it is the Word of God and bears intrinsic divine marks. He argued that the **Holy Spirit** confirms Scripture’s truth to the believer, making its authority self-evident rather than dependent on external validation. Hodge’s approach is characterized by a strong commitment to **verbal inspiration** and the **internal testimony of the Spirit**.

- "The Scriptures are self-evidencing, and their divine authority is authenticated to the mind by the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on inspiration and authority
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority is Divine and Absolute**
   - Scripture possesses authority because it is the Word of God, not because of church endorsement.
   - The authority of Scripture is objective and independent of human opinion.
   - The Bible is the ultimate standard for faith and practice.
   - All doctrines must be tested by Scripture alone.
   - "The authority of the Scriptures rests on their being the Word of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Self-attestation of Scripture**
   - The Bible contains internal evidences of its divine origin.
   - Its unity, majesty, and transformative power point to its self-authenticating nature.
   - The marks of divinity are evident to those illumined by the Spirit.
   - No external authority can ultimately validate Scripture above itself.
   - "The Scriptures bear on their face the evidence of their divine origin." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Certainty**
   - The Holy Spirit works in the heart to produce conviction of Scripture’s truth.
   - Assurance of the Bible’s authority is a supernatural work.
   - The Spirit’s testimony is necessary for true faith in the Word.
   - This inward witness is distinct from rational or historical proofs.
   - "The testimony of the Spirit is the highest and only ground of faith in the Scriptures." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Verbal Inspiration**
   - Every word of Scripture is inspired by God.
   - Inspiration extends to the very language used by the biblical authors.
   - This ensures the infallibility and inerrancy of the original texts.
   - The doctrine of inspiration undergirds the Bible’s authority.
   - "The inspiration of the Scriptures is plenary and verbal." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Scripture Interprets Scripture**
   - Clear passages illuminate more difficult ones.
   - The unity of Scripture is assumed in all interpretation.
   - Doctrinal formulations must arise from the whole counsel of God.
   - Tradition and reason are subordinate to the biblical text.
   - "The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **self-attestation and authority of Scripture** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially at Princeton Seminary. His articulation of the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** and **verbal inspiration** became hallmarks of conservative Presbyterianism. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary debates over biblical authority, serving as a touchstone for those upholding the classical Reformed doctrine of Scripture.
