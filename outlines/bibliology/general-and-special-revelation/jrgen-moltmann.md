# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **general and special revelation** through the lens of **eschatology** and **Trinitarian theology**, emphasizing that God's self-disclosure is dynamic, historical, and oriented toward the future. For Moltmann, **revelation** is encountered supremely in the **history of Jesus Christ**, where God's universal and particular self-communication invites all creation into the hope of redemption.

- "Revelation is not the imparting of information, but the opening up of a new reality in which we can live." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- God in Creation (1985)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Eschatological Event**
    - Revelation is fundamentally oriented toward the **future** and the **coming Kingdom of God**.
    - God’s self-disclosure is inseparable from the promise and hope of **eschatological fulfillment**.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the decisive event in which revelation and hope converge.
    - Revelation is not static but unfolds within the movement of history toward redemption.
    - "Revelation is the anticipation of the future of God in the present." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Christocentric Revelation**
    - The person and work of **Jesus Christ** are the center and criterion of all revelation.
    - Special revelation is not abstract but embodied in the history and suffering of Christ.
    - The cross and resurrection reveal both the depth of human alienation and the scope of divine reconciliation.
    - All knowledge of God is mediated through the event of Christ, not through general principles.
    - "God reveals himself in the cross of Christ as the God who suffers with us and for us." (The Crucified God)

3. **Trinitarian Mediation of Revelation**
    - Revelation is the work of the **Triune God**, involving Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The Spirit actualizes the revelation of Christ in the life of the church and the world.
    - The Trinity ensures that revelation is relational, participatory, and communal.
    - The dynamic of revelation mirrors the mutual indwelling and openness of the Triune persons.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the true grammar of the doctrine of revelation." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **Creation as the Arena of General Revelation**
    - Creation is the context in which God’s presence and activity are universally accessible.
    - General revelation is not merely natural theology but the ongoing engagement of God with the world.
    - The Spirit’s presence in creation points to God’s sustaining and renewing work.
    - Creation’s openness to the future is itself a sign of God’s revelatory action.
    - "Creation is the space of God’s revelation and the horizon of its hope." (God in Creation)

5. **Revelation as Invitation to Participation**
    - Revelation calls humanity into **dialogue** and **responsibility** within God’s redemptive purposes.
    - The knowledge of God is transformative, leading to hope and active engagement in the world.
    - Revelation is not a possession but a summons to ongoing faith and expectation.
    - The church is the community of those who live from and toward the promise of revelation.
    - "Revelation awakens hope and calls us to participate in the coming of God’s future." (Experiences in Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology of **revelation** has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the relationship between **general and special revelation**, especially within **eschatological** and **Trinitarian** frameworks. His focus on the openness of revelation to the future and the centrality of Christ has influenced both Protestant and ecumenical thought. Moltmann’s work continues to challenge theologians to see revelation as a dynamic, participatory event that transforms both individuals and communities in hope.
