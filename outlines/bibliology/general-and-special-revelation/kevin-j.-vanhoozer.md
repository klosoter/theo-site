# Kevin J. Vanhoozer (1957– )

Kevin J. Vanhoozer approaches **general and special revelation** through the lens of **theological hermeneutics**, emphasizing the communicative action of the **Triune God**. He maintains that **Scripture** is the normative form of special revelation, while general revelation is real but always interpreted through the light of Christ and the biblical canon. Vanhoozer’s work highlights the importance of **speech-act theory** in understanding how God reveals Himself both in creation and in the redemptive-historical narrative.

- "God’s self-communication is not exhausted by the created order but reaches its climax in the canon of Scripture." (The Drama of Doctrine)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Divine Communicative Action**
   - God reveals Himself through **speech acts** that include both general and special revelation.
   - Revelation is not merely propositional but involves God’s personal address.
   - The **Triune God** is the ultimate author and communicator in all revelation.
   - Special revelation climaxes in the incarnation and the canon of Scripture.
   - "Revelation is the meaningful making known of God’s own reality and will." (First Theology)

2. **Scripture as the Norm of Special Revelation**
   - The **biblical canon** is the authoritative and normative witness to God’s self-disclosure.
   - Scripture is the primary means by which special revelation is preserved and interpreted.
   - The authority of Scripture is rooted in its role as God’s communicative act.
   - The church’s task is to interpret and perform the scriptural drama faithfully.
   - "Scripture is the covenantal means by which God continues to address his people." (The Drama of Doctrine)

3. **General Revelation’s Reality and Limits**
   - General revelation is real and accessible through creation and conscience.
   - It is always interpreted through the lens of special revelation.
   - General revelation is sufficient for accountability but not for salvation.
   - The effects of **sin** distort human reception of general revelation.
   - "General revelation is not salvific but renders all persons responsible before God." (First Theology)

4. **Hermeneutics and the Role of the Spirit**
   - The **Holy Spirit** enables proper understanding of both general and special revelation.
   - Hermeneutics is necessary due to the distance between divine communication and human reception.
   - The Spirit works in the church to guide interpretation and application.
   - The unity of the Spirit and the Word safeguards against subjectivism.
   - "The Spirit is the agent who actualizes the meaning of the text in the life of the church." (Is There a Meaning in This Text?)

5. **Christocentric Focus of Revelation**
   - Jesus Christ is the center and fullness of all revelation.
   - All revelation, general and special, finds its coherence in Christ.
   - The incarnation is the supreme act of God’s self-communication.
   - The church reads all of Scripture and creation in light of Christ.
   - "The person and work of Christ is the hermeneutical key to all revelation." (Remythologizing Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vanhoozer has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **revelation** by integrating **hermeneutics**, **speech-act theory**, and a robust doctrine of Scripture. His canonical-linguistic approach has influenced how theologians and pastors understand the relationship between general and special revelation, emphasizing the communicative intent of the Triune God. Vanhoozer’s work continues to foster a dynamic, Christ-centered reading of both Scripture and creation within the Reformed tradition.
