# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield maintained a rigorous distinction between **general revelation** and **special revelation**, emphasizing the sufficiency of **natural revelation** for knowledge of God’s existence and the necessity of **Scripture** for saving knowledge. He argued that while **general revelation** renders humanity without excuse, only **special revelation**—culminating in the **inspiration of the Bible**—provides the redemptive truth necessary for salvation. Warfield’s approach is marked by a strong defense of the **inerrancy** and **authority** of the biblical text as the unique locus of special revelation.

- "Revelation is thus the supernatural communication of truth, whether in the sphere of nature or of grace, but it is only in the latter that we have what is technically called special revelation." (Revelation and Inspiration)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Clear distinction between general and special revelation**
    - General revelation is accessible to all through **nature** and **conscience**.
    - Special revelation is God’s direct communication, culminating in **Scripture**.
    - General revelation is insufficient for salvation but sufficient for accountability.
    - Special revelation is redemptive and propositional.
    - "General revelation is addressed to all men as men; special revelation is addressed to men as sinners." (Revelation and Inspiration)

2. **General revelation is real but limited**
    - Affirms the reality of God’s self-disclosure in creation.
    - General revelation reveals God’s existence, power, and divine nature.
    - It does not communicate the gospel or the way of salvation.
    - Its purpose is to render humanity without excuse before God.
    - "Nature reveals God, but not His saving grace." (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)

3. **Special revelation is redemptive and propositional**
    - Special revelation is necessary for knowledge of **redemption**.
    - It is given in historical acts and words, climaxing in Christ and Scripture.
    - Special revelation is propositional, containing truth claims from God.
    - The Bible is the authoritative record of special revelation.
    - "Special revelation is embodied in the Scriptures, which are themselves a product of revelation." (Revelation and Inspiration)

4. **Scripture as the unique and final form of special revelation**
    - The Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God.
    - Scripture is the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
    - All other forms of special revelation are preparatory or subordinate to Scripture.
    - The canon is closed; no new special revelation is given after the apostolic age.
    - "The Scriptures are themselves the culminating product of the process of revelation." (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)

5. **Organic inspiration of Scripture**
    - Inspiration is not mechanical dictation but organic, involving human authors.
    - The Holy Spirit superintended the process, ensuring inerrancy.
    - The human and divine elements are united without confusion or division.
    - Inspiration guarantees the truthfulness and authority of the biblical text.
    - "The Bible is the Word of God in such a sense that whatever it says, God says." (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust articulation of **general and special revelation** became foundational for the Princeton tradition and later Reformed orthodoxy. His defense of the **inspiration and authority of Scripture** shaped twentieth-century evangelicalism’s approach to revelation, especially in debates over inerrancy. Warfield’s careful distinctions continue to inform systematic theology, apologetics, and the doctrine of revelation in the Reformed tradition.
