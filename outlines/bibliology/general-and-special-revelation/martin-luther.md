# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther distinguished sharply between **general revelation**—God’s disclosure in creation and conscience—and **special revelation**—God’s saving self-disclosure in **Scripture** and, supremely, in **Jesus Christ**. While he acknowledged that all people have some knowledge of God through the created order, Luther insisted that only through the **Word of God** can sinners come to a true and saving knowledge of God’s will and grace.

- "For apart from the Word and the revelation of God, there is no knowledge of God, no faith, and no worship." (Lectures on Romans)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Romans
- The Bondage of the Will
- Large Catechism
- Small Catechism
- Disputation Against Scholastic Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General revelation is real but limited**
    - God reveals Himself in creation, providence, and the human conscience.
    - This knowledge is sufficient to render humanity **without excuse** before God.
    - General revelation cannot lead to salvation or a true knowledge of God’s grace.
    - Fallen human reason distorts and suppresses the truth revealed in nature.
    - "Nature and reason, no matter how much they strive, cannot know what God wants to give or do toward us." (Large Catechism)

2. **Special revelation is necessary for salvation**
    - Only **Scripture** reveals the gospel and the way of salvation.
    - The **Word of God** is the means by which God communicates His will and grace.
    - Christ is the center and content of special revelation.
    - Faith comes only through hearing the Word, not through nature or reason.
    - "God does not want to be known except through Christ, nor can He be known otherwise." (The Bondage of the Will)

3. **The insufficiency of reason and natural theology**
    - Human reason is corrupted by sin and cannot attain saving knowledge of God.
    - Attempts to know God apart from Scripture lead to idolatry or despair.
    - **Theology of the Cross** opposes all attempts to find God in glory or nature.
    - True knowledge of God is hidden in the suffering and revelation of Christ.
    - "He who would know God, let him look into the manger and the cross." (Sermons on the Gospel of John)

4. **Scripture as the ultimate authority**
    - The Bible is the only infallible source of knowledge about God’s redemptive will.
    - All doctrines and experiences must be tested by **Scripture alone** (**sola Scriptura**).
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture stand in contrast to the ambiguity of general revelation.
    - The Holy Spirit works through the Word to illumine and apply its truth.
    - "The Holy Scriptures alone are to be the light and foundation of all doctrine." (Disputation Against Scholastic Theology)

5. **Christ as the fullness of revelation**
    - Jesus Christ is the definitive and personal revelation of God.
    - All previous revelation finds its fulfillment and meaning in Christ.
    - The gospel reveals God’s righteousness and mercy, hidden from natural reason.
    - To know God truly is to know Him as revealed in the incarnate Son.
    - "In Christ God has placed all His revelation and made Himself known to us." (Lectures on Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s distinction between **general and special revelation** shaped Protestant theology’s understanding of the limits of natural knowledge of God and the necessity of **Scripture** for salvation. His emphasis on the **Word of God** and **sola Scriptura** provided a foundation for later Reformed and Lutheran doctrines of revelation. Luther’s skepticism toward natural theology and his focus on Christ as the center of revelation continue to influence contemporary discussions on the relationship between faith, reason, and revelation.
