# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos distinguished sharply between **general revelation** and **special revelation**, emphasizing their distinct roles in the history of redemption. For Vos, **general revelation** provides a universal witness to God’s existence and attributes, while **special revelation** is redemptive, culminating in the person and work of Christ and inscripturated in **Scripture**. He saw both forms as integral to **Reformed theology**, but insisted that only special revelation leads to saving knowledge of God.

- "General revelation is the presupposition of special revelation, but it is only in the latter that the full-orbed self-disclosure of God is realized." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "Revelation and Inspiration" (in The Princeton Theological Review)
- "The Doctrine of Revelation in the History of the Church" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General Revelation is Universal and Non-Redemptive**
    - General revelation is accessible to all people through **creation** and **providence**.
    - It reveals God's existence, power, and divine attributes, but not the way of salvation.
    - It leaves humanity without excuse but does not provide saving knowledge.
    - General revelation is preparatory, not sufficient for redemption.
    - "General revelation is not redemptive in character, but forms the background for the necessity of special revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics)

2. **Special Revelation is Historical and Redemptive**
    - Special revelation unfolds progressively in history, culminating in Christ.
    - It is necessary for the knowledge of God's redemptive will and purposes.
    - Special revelation is given through acts and words, ultimately inscripturated in **Scripture**.
    - It is the means by which God enters into covenant relationship with His people.
    - "Special revelation is the supernatural self-disclosure of God in the sphere of redemption." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
    - Both general and special revelation are unified in their source: the triune God.
    - Revelation is not merely propositional but is organically connected to redemptive history.
    - The unity is seen in the unfolding of God’s plan from creation to consummation.
    - Vos rejects any dualism that would separate nature and grace absolutely.
    - "Revelation is a living process, organically connected with the history of redemption." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Scripture as the Norm of Special Revelation**
    - Scripture is the authoritative record and culmination of special revelation.
    - The Bible is both the product and the means of special revelation.
    - All other forms of special revelation are subordinate to and interpreted by Scripture.
    - The canon is closed; ongoing revelation is not normative.
    - "The Scriptures are the permanent embodiment of special revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics)

5. **Revelation and Covenant**
    - Special revelation is always covenantal in structure and purpose.
    - God’s self-disclosure in special revelation establishes and maintains covenant relationships.
    - The covenant motif unites the various epochs of special revelation.
    - The climax of covenantal revelation is found in Christ, the mediator of the new covenant.
    - "The idea of the covenant is inseparably connected with the idea of revelation." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s distinction between **general and special revelation** has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, providing a framework for understanding the relationship between creation, redemption, and Scripture. His emphasis on the **organic unity** and historical progression of revelation influenced generations of theologians, particularly at Westminster Theological Seminary. Vos’s work remains foundational for discussions of revelation, covenant, and the redemptive-historical method in contemporary theology.
