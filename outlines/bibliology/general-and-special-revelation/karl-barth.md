# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically redefined the relationship between **general revelation** and **special revelation**, insisting that true knowledge of God comes exclusively through **God’s self-revelation in Jesus Christ**. He rejected natural theology and the sufficiency of **creation** or human reason to disclose God savingly, emphasizing that **Scripture** is the unique and authoritative witness to God’s revelation.

- "There is no such thing as a revelation of God which is not the revelation of God in Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Church Dogmatics II/1: The Doctrine of God
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Natural Theology (with Emil Brunner)
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Personal and Christocentric**
   - Revelation is not a static deposit but the living act of God’s self-disclosure.
   - Jesus Christ is the sole mediator and content of revelation.
   - All knowledge of God is mediated through Christ, not through abstract principles.
   - Revelation is event, not information.
   - "Jesus Christ is the one Word of God which we have to hear and which we have to trust and obey in life and in death." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Rejection of Natural Theology**
   - Human reason and nature cannot provide saving knowledge of God.
   - General revelation, as traditionally conceived, is denied any independent theological value.
   - Barth’s debate with Brunner centered on the impossibility of a “point of contact” in humanity.
   - Any attempt to know God apart from Christ is idolatrous.
   - "Natural theology is a heresy, a denial of Jesus Christ." (Natural Theology)

3. **Scripture as Witness to Revelation**
   - The Bible is not itself revelation but the authoritative witness to God’s revelation in Christ.
   - The Holy Spirit enables Scripture to become the Word of God to the hearer.
   - Scripture’s authority is derivative from the self-revealing act of God.
   - The church stands under the authority of the Word attested in Scripture.
   - "The Bible is the witness of divine revelation, not revelation itself." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

4. **Revelation is Sovereign and Free**
   - God alone determines when, where, and how He reveals Himself.
   - Revelation cannot be controlled, predicted, or deduced from human experience.
   - There is no continuity between human religious experience and divine revelation.
   - God’s freedom ensures the gratuity and surprise of revelation.
   - "God reveals Himself. He reveals Himself through Himself. He reveals Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

5. **Creation and Providence are Not Salvific Revelation**
   - Creation testifies to God’s existence but does not communicate saving knowledge.
   - Providence is understood only in light of Christ’s revelation.
   - The order of creation is interpreted through the lens of special revelation.
   - Any knowledge of God from creation is ambiguous and insufficient for faith.
   - "The revelation of God is the abolition of all religion, including the Christian religion." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s rejection of **natural theology** and his insistence on the primacy of **special revelation** in Christ reshaped twentieth-century Protestant theology. His views provoked enduring debates about the relationship between **creation**, reason, and revelation, especially in dialogue with Roman Catholic and Reformed traditions. Barth’s Christocentric approach remains a defining reference point for discussions of revelation, even among those who critique his sharp dichotomy between general and special revelation.
