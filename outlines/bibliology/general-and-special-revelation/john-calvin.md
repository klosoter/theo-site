# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin distinguished sharply between **general revelation**—God’s disclosure of Himself in **creation** and **providence**—and **special revelation**, which comes through **Scripture** and is necessary for saving knowledge of God. While Calvin affirmed that all people have an innate sense of the **divine (sensus divinitatis)**, he insisted that only through the **Word of God** can fallen humanity truly know God as Redeemer.

- "For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the Maker of them is seen." (Institutes I.5.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 3–10)
- Commentary on Genesis
- Commentary on Romans
- Sermons on Job
- John Calvin’s Doctrine of the Knowledge of God by T.H.L. Parker

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General revelation is universal but limited**
    - God reveals Himself to all people through the created order and human conscience.
    - This revelation renders all humanity without excuse before God.
    - The **sensus divinitatis** is innate but suppressed by sin.
    - General revelation does not communicate the way of salvation.
    - "There is within the human mind, and indeed by natural instinct, an awareness of divinity." (Institutes I.3.1)

2. **Special revelation is necessary for salvation**
    - The knowledge of God as Redeemer is found only in Scripture.
    - Fallen humanity cannot attain saving knowledge through nature alone.
    - The **Word of God** is the clear and sufficient means of knowing God’s will.
    - Special revelation corrects and completes what is dimly perceived in general revelation.
    - "God must go further and declare Himself by His Word for us to know Him unto salvation." (Institutes I.6.1)

3. **Scripture as the norming norm**
    - Scripture is the supreme authority for faith and practice.
    - The Holy Spirit authenticates Scripture’s divine origin to the believer.
    - All other knowledge of God must be tested by Scripture.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are essential for true knowledge of God.
    - "Scripture, gathering up the otherwise confused knowledge of God in our minds, having dispersed our dullness, clearly shows us the true God." (Institutes I.6.1)

4. **The noetic effects of sin**
    - Sin corrupts human reason and distorts perception of general revelation.
    - The image of God is marred, not erased, in fallen humanity.
    - Without regeneration, people misuse and misunderstand the knowledge of God in creation.
    - Only the Spirit’s work enables right understanding of both general and special revelation.
    - "Our mind, because of the blindness caused by sin, cannot come to God unless it is illuminated by the Spirit through the Word." (Institutes I.5.14)

5. **The unity of revelation in Christ**
    - Christ is the ultimate revelation of God, fulfilling both general and special revelation.
    - All true knowledge of God is centered in the person and work of Christ.
    - The Old Testament anticipates, and the New Testament reveals, Christ as the mediator of revelation.
    - The purpose of both forms of revelation is to lead to worship and obedience to God.
    - "For, if we seek the most perfect knowledge of God, it is necessary to turn our eyes to Christ, in whom His image is set forth to us." (Institutes I.13.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of **general and special revelation** profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition’s understanding of the relationship between nature, Scripture, and salvation. His emphasis on the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the necessity of the Spirit’s illumination remains foundational for Reformed epistemology. Calvin’s categories continue to inform debates on natural theology, apologetics, and the limits of human reason in theology. His influence endures in both confessional documents and contemporary discussions of revelation.
