# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a robust distinction between **general revelation** (what can be known of God through **natural reason** and the created order) and **special revelation** (truths disclosed by God through **Scripture** and **divine intervention**). He maintained that while **natural theology** provides genuine knowledge of God's existence and some attributes, the mysteries of **salvation** and the **Trinity** require supernatural revelation.

- "Some truths about God exceed all the ability of the human reason. Such is the truth that God is triune. But there are some truths which the natural reason also is able to reach, such as that God exists, that He is one, and the like." (Summa Theologiae I.1.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I.1, I.2, I.12
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book I
- De Veritate, Q.14
- Commentary on Romans
- Faith, Reason, and Theology (ed. A. Kenny)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General Revelation Accessible by Reason**
    - Human beings can attain knowledge of God's existence and basic attributes through observation of the created world.
    - **Natural reason** is sufficient to demonstrate truths such as God's unity, eternity, and goodness.
    - General revelation is available to all people, regardless of their access to Scripture.
    - This knowledge is limited and does not suffice for salvation.
    - "To know that God exists in a general and confused way is implanted in us by nature." (Summa Theologiae I.2.1)

2. **Special Revelation Necessary for Salvation**
    - Certain divine truths, especially those concerning the **Trinity** and **Incarnation**, surpass human reason.
    - God reveals these mysteries through Scripture and the teaching of the Church.
    - Special revelation is necessary for the fullness of faith and salvation.
    - Without special revelation, humanity would remain ignorant of the means of grace.
    - "It was necessary for man's salvation that there should be a knowledge revealed by God besides philosophical science built up by human reason." (Summa Theologiae I.1.1)

3. **Harmony of Faith and Reason**
    - **Faith** and **reason** are distinct but never ultimately in conflict, since both originate from God.
    - Reason prepares for faith by establishing the credibility of revelation.
    - Faith perfects reason by granting access to truths reason cannot attain on its own.
    - Apparent contradictions arise from misunderstanding either revelation or reason.
    - "Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it." (Summa Theologiae I.1.8)

4. **Analogy in Theological Language**
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal or purely equivocal.
    - Analogy allows for meaningful discourse about God based on general revelation.
    - This preserves both the **transcendence** and **knowability** of God.
    - Special revelation clarifies and corrects the limits of analogical language.
    - "We cannot know what God is, but only what He is not; we must therefore consider the ways in which God does not resemble creatures rather than the ways in which He does." (Summa Contra Gentiles I.30)

5. **Order of Knowing: From Nature to Grace**
    - The human mind naturally begins with knowledge of the sensible world.
    - Through **natural theology**, reason ascends to knowledge of God as first cause.
    - Special revelation then provides higher truths inaccessible to unaided reason.
    - The order of learning moves from general revelation to special revelation, mirroring the order of being.
    - "The knowledge of God is implanted in all men naturally, but the knowledge of the mysteries of grace is given by special revelation." (De Veritate Q.14)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s distinction between **general and special revelation** became foundational for later Christian theology, especially in the development of **natural theology** and the relationship between faith and reason. His synthesis influenced both Roman Catholic and Protestant thought, shaping debates on the limits of human reason and the necessity of divine disclosure. Aquinas’s nuanced approach continues to inform contemporary discussions on the epistemology of religious belief and the accessibility of God’s truth.
