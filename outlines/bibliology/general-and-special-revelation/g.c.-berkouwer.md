# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **general and special revelation** by emphasizing their unity in the self-disclosure of God, while carefully distinguishing their respective roles in **theology**. He rejected both a natural theology independent of **Scripture** and any separation that would undermine the universal witness of **general revelation**. For Berkouwer, **special revelation** in Christ and Scripture is the decisive interpretive key to understanding all revelation.

- "General revelation does not function as an independent source of knowledge of God, but is always understood in the light of special revelation." (General Revelation, p. 259)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Revelation**
   - God’s self-disclosure is one, though it comes through both general and special revelation.
   - Both forms of revelation are ultimately grounded in the **personal God** who reveals Himself.
   - The distinction is not between two kinds of truth, but two modes of God’s communication.
   - Special revelation interprets and fulfills the witness of general revelation.
   - "The unity of revelation is not a unity of content, but a unity of the revealing God." (General Revelation, p. 19)

2. **Christocentric Focus**
   - **Special revelation** culminates in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
   - Christ is the hermeneutical center for understanding all revelation.
   - General revelation finds its true meaning only in light of Christ.
   - The knowledge of God is ultimately mediated through Christ as revealed in Scripture.
   - "Christ is the heart of revelation, and all revelation is to be understood in relation to Him." (General Revelation, p. 273)

3. **Critical Rejection of Natural Theology**
   - Berkouwer critiques autonomous **natural theology** as insufficient and misleading.
   - He insists that knowledge of God from creation is always dependent on God’s initiative.
   - Human sin distorts the reception of general revelation, necessitating special revelation.
   - True knowledge of God cannot be constructed apart from **Scripture**.
   - "Natural theology, as an independent source, is a misunderstanding of the nature of revelation." (General Revelation, p. 53)

4. **Scripture as Normative**
   - **Scripture** is the normative witness to special revelation.
   - The authority of Scripture is foundational for theology and the interpretation of revelation.
   - General revelation is properly understood only through the lens of Scripture.
   - The **Holy Spirit** illumines both general and special revelation, but always in accordance with Scripture.
   - "Scripture is not one revelation among others, but the norm by which all revelation is judged." (Holy Scripture, p. 18)

5. **Revelation and Human Response**
   - Human beings are addressed by God in both general and special revelation.
   - Sin affects the ability to perceive and respond to general revelation.
   - Faith is the proper response to special revelation, made possible by the Spirit.
   - The universality of general revelation leaves humanity without excuse, but not without need for the gospel.
   - "The revelation of God always calls for a response, but that response is possible only through grace." (General Revelation, p. 261)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced treatment of **general and special revelation** influenced Reformed theology by challenging both rationalistic natural theology and Barthian dialectical approaches. His insistence on the **unity of revelation** and the centrality of Christ provided a mediating path between traditional confessionalism and modern theological trends. Berkouwer’s work remains a significant resource for understanding the relationship between **creation, Scripture, and Christ** in contemporary theology.
