# John Webster (1955–2016)

John Webster approached **general and special revelation** as distinct yet inseparable aspects of God's self-disclosure, emphasizing that all revelation is grounded in the **triune God's sovereign initiative**. He insisted that **special revelation**—supremely in **Jesus Christ** and **Holy Scripture**—is necessary for true knowledge of God, while **general revelation** is always interpreted in light of the gospel. Webster’s theology is marked by a strong emphasis on the **self-communicative act of God** and the priority of **divine self-revelation** over human religious experience.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Divine Self-Communication**
   - Revelation is fundamentally God’s act of making himself known, not merely the transmission of facts.
   - Both **general** and **special revelation** are rooted in the triune God’s initiative.
   - God’s self-communication is personal, relational, and purposive.
   - Human knowledge of God is always dependent on God’s self-giving.
   - "Revelation is the self-presentation of the triune God, not simply the imparting of truths about God." (Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch)

2. **Priority of Special Revelation**
   - Special revelation, especially in **Jesus Christ** and **Scripture**, is necessary for saving knowledge of God.
   - General revelation is real but insufficient for salvation or full knowledge of God’s will.
   - Special revelation interprets and fulfills the partial knowledge available in general revelation.
   - The church is the community formed by and for special revelation.
   - "Special revelation is the definitive and normative self-disclosure of God." (Word and Church)

3. **Christological Focus of Revelation**
   - Jesus Christ is the center and fullness of all revelation.
   - All revelation, general or special, is oriented toward and fulfilled in Christ.
   - The incarnation is the supreme event of God’s self-revelation.
   - Knowledge of God is mediated through union with Christ.
   - "The revelation of God is identical with the person and history of Jesus Christ." (Confessing God)

4. **Scripture as the Norm of Revelation**
   - **Holy Scripture** is the divinely appointed witness to God’s self-revelation.
   - Scripture is both the product and instrument of the Spirit’s revelatory work.
   - The authority of Scripture derives from its role in mediating special revelation.
   - The interpretation of general revelation is normed by Scripture.
   - "Scripture is the creaturely means by which God’s self-revelation is communicated to the church." (Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch)

5. **Revelation and Human Response**
   - Human knowledge of God is always a response to God’s prior self-giving.
   - Faith is the proper mode of receiving revelation.
   - Sin distorts human perception of both general and special revelation.
   - The Spirit enables true knowledge and reception of revelation.
   - "Revelation elicits and enables the human response of faith, which is itself a gift of God." (The Domain of the Word)

## Legacy and Impact

Webster’s account of **general and special revelation** has shaped contemporary dogmatics by re-centering the discussion on the **sovereign initiative of the triune God** and the centrality of **Christ**. His insistence on the primacy of **special revelation** and the authority of **Holy Scripture** has influenced both Reformed and broader ecumenical theology. Webster’s work continues to challenge theologians to ground all knowledge of God in God’s own self-communication, resisting reductionist or purely naturalistic accounts of revelation.
