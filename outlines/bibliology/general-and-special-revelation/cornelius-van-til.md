# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til developed a distinctive Reformed approach to **general and special revelation**, insisting on the absolute necessity of **special revelation** for true knowledge of God due to the effects of **sin** on human reasoning. He argued that while **general revelation** renders all people inexcusable before God, only **special revelation**—culminating in **Scripture**—provides the redemptive knowledge necessary for salvation and proper interpretation of the world.

- "It is only in terms of the authoritative revelation of God in Scripture that man can interpret general revelation aright." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Common Grace and the Gospel
- Christian Apologetics
- Revelation and Reason (with Greg L. Bahnsen and others)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General Revelation is Sufficient for Condemnation, Not Salvation**
    - All people receive knowledge of God through creation, conscience, and providence.
    - This revelation is clear but is universally suppressed in unrighteousness due to sin.
    - General revelation leaves humanity without excuse before God.
    - It does not provide the redemptive knowledge necessary for salvation.
    - "General revelation is always clear, but it is always suppressed by sinful man." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Special Revelation is Redemptive and Authoritative**
    - Special revelation is necessary for a saving knowledge of God.
    - It comes through historical acts, prophecy, and ultimately through Scripture.
    - Scripture is the final, normative form of special revelation.
    - Special revelation interprets and clarifies general revelation.
    - "Special revelation is needed to interpret general revelation aright." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Antithesis Between Believer and Unbeliever**
    - Sin creates an epistemological divide between those regenerated by the Spirit and those who are not.
    - The unbeliever misinterprets general revelation due to a rebellious heart.
    - Only through regeneration and special revelation can one rightly understand God’s world.
    - The antithesis is foundational for Van Til’s apologetic method.
    - "There is an absolute ethical antithesis between the regenerate and the unregenerate." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Revelation is Covenantal and Personal**
    - Both general and special revelation are expressions of God’s covenantal relationship with humanity.
    - Revelation is always personal, not abstract or impersonal.
    - God addresses humanity as covenant creatures responsible to Him.
    - The covenant context shapes the meaning and purpose of all revelation.
    - "All revelation is covenantal; God always speaks as the covenant Lord." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Presuppositional Epistemology**
    - Human knowledge depends on presuppositions rooted in either submission to or rejection of God’s revelation.
    - The Christian worldview, grounded in special revelation, alone provides the foundation for intelligible experience.
    - Unbelieving thought is ultimately self-defeating because it suppresses the truth of general revelation.
    - Apologetics must challenge the presuppositions underlying non-Christian worldviews.
    - "Christian theism must be shown to be the presupposition of all intelligible predication." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust doctrine of **general and special revelation** profoundly shaped Reformed epistemology and apologetics, especially through his development of **presuppositionalism**. His insistence on the necessity of **special revelation** for true knowledge of God has influenced generations of theologians and apologists, particularly within the Westminster tradition. Van Til’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between **revelation, reason, and faith**, and his work remains foundational for those seeking a consistently Reformed approach to theology and apologetics.
