# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulated a robust doctrine of **revelation** that distinguishes between **general revelation**—God’s self-disclosure in creation and providence—and **special revelation**, which is God’s redemptive self-communication culminating in **Scripture** and the person of **Christ**. He insisted that general revelation renders all humanity responsible before God, but only special revelation leads to **salvation** and true knowledge of God’s will.

- "Revelation is the presupposition, the foundation, the content, and the rule of all religious knowledge and life." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General Revelation is Universal and Foundational**
    - God reveals Himself to all people through **nature**, **history**, and **human conscience**.
    - General revelation establishes the basis for **natural theology** and human accountability.
    - It is continuous and accessible, yet insufficient for **salvation**.
    - General revelation points to God’s existence, power, and divine attributes.
    "General revelation is the foundation on which special revelation builds." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1.311)

2. **Special Revelation is Redemptive and Historical**
    - Special revelation is necessary due to the **fall** and human sinfulness.
    - It unfolds progressively in **redemptive history**, climaxing in **Christ**.
    - Special revelation is communicated through **miracles**, **prophecy**, and ultimately **Scripture**.
    - It is the means by which God restores fellowship with humanity.
    "Special revelation is the reestablishment of the broken bond between God and humanity." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1.354)

3. **Unity and Distinction of Revelation**
    - Both forms of revelation originate from the same God and are ultimately harmonious.
    - General and special revelation serve distinct but complementary purposes.
    - Special revelation presupposes and interprets general revelation.
    - The distinction safeguards the uniqueness of **biblical revelation** while affirming the value of creation.
    "Special revelation does not abolish general revelation but rather presupposes and affirms it." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1.312)

4. **Revelation is Personal and Covenantal**
    - Revelation is not merely propositional but involves God’s personal self-disclosure.
    - God enters into **covenant** relationship with humanity through revelation.
    - The goal of revelation is **communion** with God, not just information.
    - Both general and special revelation are acts of divine condescension and grace.
    "God reveals himself in order to be known, loved, and served." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1.282)

5. **Scripture as the Norm of Special Revelation**
    - Scripture is the inspired, authoritative record and means of special revelation.
    - It provides the normative interpretation of all revelation, including general.
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables the proper reception and understanding of Scripture.
    - Scripture’s authority is self-attesting and foundational for theology.
    "Holy Scripture is the means by which special revelation is preserved and transmitted." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1.384)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced distinction between **general and special revelation** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in discussions of **natural theology** and the doctrine of **Scripture**. His emphasis on the unity and complementarity of both forms of revelation continues to influence contemporary debates on **revelation** and **apologetics**. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a robust, confessional, and theologically integrated understanding of how God makes Himself known.
