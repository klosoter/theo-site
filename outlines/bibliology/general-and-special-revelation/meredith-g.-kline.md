# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline developed a distinctive approach to **general and special revelation** by emphasizing the covenantal structure of God's self-disclosure. He argued that **general revelation** is universally accessible through creation, yet only **special revelation**—culminating in Scripture—provides the redemptive knowledge necessary for salvation. Kline’s work highlights the **theophanic** and **covenantal** character of revelation, insisting on the inseparability of God's acts and words in history.

- "The creation itself is a cosmic revelation, a theophanic display of the glory of the Creator." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Images of the Spirit
- By Oath Consigned
- Treaty of the Great King

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General Revelation as Theophanic**
   - General revelation is manifest in the created order as a display of God's glory.
   - Creation serves as a **cosmic temple**, revealing God's presence and majesty.
   - All humanity is confronted with the knowledge of God through nature and providence.
   - This revelation is sufficient for condemnation but not for salvation.
   - "The world is a grand theophany, a visible manifestation of the invisible God." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Special Revelation as Covenantal**
   - Special revelation is structured by **covenant**, involving both divine word and act.
   - God’s redemptive purposes are disclosed through historical covenants culminating in Christ.
   - Special revelation interprets and fulfills the meaning of general revelation.
   - Scripture is the normative form of special revelation for the church.
   - "The covenant is the formal means by which God reveals himself redemptively to his people." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

3. **Integration of Word and Act**
   - Revelation is not merely propositional but is inseparable from God’s redemptive deeds.
   - Theophanic events (e.g., Sinai, creation) are both acts and communications of God.
   - The unity of word and act is foundational for understanding biblical authority.
   - This integration is especially evident in the **covenant treaty** form of revelation.
   - "God’s mighty acts and his interpretive words together constitute his special revelation." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

4. **Limitations of General Revelation**
   - General revelation is real but insufficient for saving knowledge of God.
   - The effects of sin distort human reception of general revelation.
   - Only special revelation addresses the problem of human depravity and provides the gospel.
   - The clarity of general revelation leaves humanity without excuse, but not with hope.
   - "General revelation is suppressed in unrighteousness, necessitating the gracious intrusion of special revelation." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Typology and Eschatology in Revelation**
   - Both general and special revelation employ **typological** structures pointing to eschatological fulfillment.
   - Creation itself is a type of the new creation revealed in Christ.
   - Special revelation interprets the typology embedded in general revelation.
   - The movement from creation to consummation is a central theme in Kline’s theology of revelation.
   - "The typological movement from creation to new creation is the backbone of biblical revelation." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and theophanic approach to **general and special revelation** has significantly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in the areas of **covenant theology** and the doctrine of Scripture. His emphasis on the unity of word and act in revelation has influenced generations of scholars in understanding the authority and structure of biblical revelation. Kline’s typological and eschatological insights continue to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between creation, redemption, and consummation. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a robust, covenantally grounded doctrine of revelation.
