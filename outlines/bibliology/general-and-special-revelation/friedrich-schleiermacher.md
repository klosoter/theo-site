# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the understanding of **general and special revelation** by centering religious knowledge in the **feeling of absolute dependence** rather than in external propositional content. He saw **revelation** as a universal, inward experience accessible to all, with **Christian revelation** representing the highest historical expression of this consciousness rather than a qualitatively distinct act of divine disclosure.

- "Every religious affection, as such, is a modification of the feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Universal Religious Consciousness**
    - Revelation is not limited to specific events or texts but is present in the universal human capacity for religious feeling.
    - All humans participate in **general revelation** through their innate sense of dependence on the infinite.
    - **Special revelation** is not a separate category but a heightened form of the same religious consciousness.
    - The distinction between general and special revelation is thus one of degree, not kind.
    - "The essence of religion consists in the feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Primacy of Feeling over Propositional Content**
    - Religious knowledge is grounded in immediate self-consciousness, not in doctrinal propositions.
    - Revelation is experienced inwardly, not primarily through external words or miracles.
    - Doctrines are secondary expressions of the original religious experience.
    - This approach shifts the locus of revelation from objective events to subjective experience.
    - "Dogmatics is the science which treats of the Christian religious affections." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Christ as the Exemplar of Revelation**
    - Jesus is the supreme example of the God-consciousness that defines revelation.
    - Christ's significance lies in his perfect and continuous God-consciousness, not in unique supernatural acts.
    - The church recognizes Christ as the highest point of revelation because of his exemplary religious experience.
    - The uniqueness of Christian revelation is historical and personal, not ontological.
    - "In Him the divine essence was so completely revealed that He is the Redeemer for all." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Historical Mediation of Revelation**
    - Revelation unfolds within the context of human history and culture.
    - The development of religious consciousness is shaped by communal and historical processes.
    - Scripture is a witness to the highest form of God-consciousness but is not itself revelation in a direct sense.
    - The church community plays a central role in transmitting and interpreting revelation.
    - "Christianity is the highest religion, because it is the religion of redemption." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Continuity between Nature and Grace**
    - There is no absolute divide between **nature** (general revelation) and **grace** (special revelation).
    - All revelation is rooted in the same divine reality, experienced in varying degrees.
    - The supernatural is not a break with the natural but its fulfillment.
    - This continuity challenges traditional Reformed distinctions between general and special revelation.
    - "The supernatural is only the completion of the natural." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **revelation** profoundly influenced modern theology by shifting the focus from external authority to **religious experience** and self-consciousness. His reconfiguration of general and special revelation laid the groundwork for later liberal and existential theologies, challenging classical Reformed distinctions. While often critiqued for undermining the objectivity of revelation, his emphasis on the universality and inwardness of religious knowledge continues to shape contemporary debates on the nature of **revelation** and the relationship between faith and reason.
