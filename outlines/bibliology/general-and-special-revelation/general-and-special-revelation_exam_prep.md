### TITLE
One self-disclosing God, two modes of disclosure: integrating general and special revelation without collapsing either

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: how the one divine self-revelation relates in its general and special modes, given creaturely finitude and sin, so that God is truly known yet salvation requires Christ and Scripture.
- Decisive figures: Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Herman Bavinck, Karl Barth, Cornelius Van Til.
- Traditions: classical theism and Thomistic natural theology, Reformed scholastic and neo-Calvinist accounts of revelation and principia, modern dialectical theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Reformed natural theology and common grace, principia of theology, presuppositional versus evidential approaches.
  - External: Thomist claims for the scope of natural knowledge of God, Barth’s denial of natural theology, Enlightenment distortions.
  - Contemporary: analytic revival of natural theology and Reformed epistemology, pluralism and the unevangelized, natural law in public theology, science and revelation.
- Position defended: a classically theistic, Reformed, covenantal account in which general revelation renders all people without excuse and yields true though suppressed knowledge, while special revelation in Christ and Scripture is necessary and sufficient for saving knowledge and normatively interprets general revelation; natural theology is legitimate only as reinterpreted within the stance of faith and the principia of Scripture and Spirit.

### ESSAY
General and special revelation name not two gods or two truths but two modes by which the one God makes himself known to rational creatures. General revelation is God’s universal, continuous self-disclosure in the created order and the human conscience that communicates his eternal power and divine nature and binds all people under obligation. Special revelation is God’s redemptive self-disclosure in the history of promise and fulfillment culminating in Jesus Christ, authoritatively inscripturated in the prophetic and apostolic writings. The distinction guards both universality and particularity. The unity protects the singularity and faithfulness of God. When this topic is examined before the bar of Scripture and classical theism, and then disciplined by the best of the Reformed tradition, several conceptual anchors are decisive: **divine simplicity** grounds the unity of revelation in the unity of God’s act ad extra; **analogical knowledge** clarifies that finite creatures know the true God though not comprehensively; **noetic effects of sin** explain why general revelation does not save; and the Reformed **principia** of theology locate special revelation as the external normative principle with the Spirit’s illumination as the internal principle.

The biblical canon frames the field with clarity and tension. Psalm 19 declares the heavens proclaim the glory of God and the law of the Lord makes the simple wise. Romans 1 affirms that what can be known about God is plain, revealed in the things that have been made, so that all are without excuse, while Romans 2 speaks of the work of the law written on the heart. Acts 14 and 17 present a God who gives rains and fruitful seasons and who is near to all, and yet calls all everywhere to repent because he has fixed a day to judge by the man he has appointed. Hebrews 1 compresses the logic of special revelation: God spoke in many times and ways by the prophets but now has spoken by his Son. Scripture thus posits a real cognitive content in general revelation and a universal moral accountability accompanied by suppression and idolatry. It then roots salvation in the special revelation of Christ, attested by prophetic and apostolic words that function as covenant documents for the church. Any account faithful to these texts must preserve the dual claims: universal knowledge and universal guilt under general revelation, and the necessity and sufficiency of special revelation for saving knowledge.

Thomas Aquinas stands as a decisive architect of the classical articulation of general revelation and natural theology. Writing within a robust doctrine of God ordered by **divine simplicity**, immutability, and aseity, he distinguishes two ways the truth about God is known by us: some truths exceed all the ability of the human reason, such as the Trinity and the economy of salvation; others are reachable by natural reason, such as that God exists and is one, living, intelligent, and the source and end of creatures. In the Summa Theologiae and Summa contra Gentiles he frames knowledge of God via effects. Because God is **ipsum esse subsistens**, creatures reflect him analogically and can lead the mind to him by causal inference. The viae move from motion, causality, contingency, gradation, and teleology to the necessary being who is pure act. The metaphysical apparatus secures both epistemic reach and epistemic chastity: because of **analogical knowledge**, we can predicate truly of God without univocity and without collapsing Creator into creature. In ethics, general revelation grounds a **natural law** known by practical reason’s first principles. Aquinas adds the axiom that grace does not destroy nature but perfects it, which resists both Pelagianism and a Manichean denigration of creation.

A Reformed student must parse Aquinas with discrimination. Positive lessons include his metaphysical defense of the Creator creature distinction and **analogical knowledge**, his conviction that there is a real content to natural knowledge, and his insistence that the revealed mysteries are not demonstrable by reason. Pressure points include the scope of reason under sin, the existential conditions of fallen inquiry, and the risk of treating proofs as a theologically neutral prolegomenon. Aquinas himself is not a rationalist. He recognizes that many fail to reach demonstrated conclusions and that few do so without error. But his placement of natural knowledge as a structurally available enterprise can be read, in some receptions, as granting too much to autonomous reason. That reception is precisely what the Reformed tradition resists.

John Calvin reframes the discussion by contextualizing all knowing within the theater of God’s **federal** governance and our fallen condition. In the Institutes he teaches that a **sensus divinitatis**, a seed of religion, is innate to humanity and constantly awakened by the spectacle of creation and providence. Yet because of sin, this seed produces a luxuriant forest of idols rather than worship, and the mind becomes a factory of images. The heavens still tell God’s glory, but men are blind and deaf to it, and whatever flashes of truth remain are twisted into superstition or pride. Calvin intensifies the Pauline theme of suppression into an epistemic tragedy. The solution is special revelation functioning as spectacles that correct our blurred vision. By the Spirit’s illumination, Scripture becomes the **principium cognoscendi** externum of theology, disclosing God’s will for salvation and reinterpreting the world. Calvin does not deny that pagans know truths about God or about moral order. He reads the arts and sciences as gifts of the Spirit bestowed for the common good. But these truths are fragmentary, unstable, and parasitic unless subordinated to God’s covenant Word. Calvin’s contribution is thus a more dynamic account of revelation governed by redemptive history, the Creator creature distinction, and the disabling effects of sin that make special revelation necessary not only for salvation but for the right use of general revelation.

Herman Bavinck develops Calvin’s lines into a rich organic synthesis. His core thesis is that revelation is one, originating in God’s will and wisdom, unfolding organically across creation, history, conscience, and Scripture. General revelation provides the creational foundation for culture, science, and morality; special revelation restores and consummates, culminating in Christ, the image of the invisible God. Bavinck accents **common grace** as the divine preservation of human capacities and cultural development after the fall, thereby explaining why general revelation still reaches us and yields genuine albeit non-saving knowledge. He resists two reductionisms: the rationalist reduction of revelation to human discovery and the mystic reduction of revelation to subjective experience. Revelation is God’s act and word, authoritative and cognitive. On natural theology Bavinck is cautious but not dismissive. Theistic arguments have heuristic value, but only when reinterpreted within the Christian worldview and protected from an autonomous starting point. His emphasis on the principia is crucial: God himself is the **principium essendi** of theology; Scripture, as God’s written Word, is the external cognitive principle; the Spirit supplies the internal principle by regenerating and illumining. Bavinck’s organic motif prevents the rupture of general and special revelation while preserving their asymmetry in fallen history.

Karl Barth represents a dramatic modern counterpoint. In reaction to liberal historicism and natural religion, he re-centered the doctrine of revelation upon God’s sovereign self-speaking in Jesus Christ. Revelation is an event of God’s freedom. There is no natural knowledge of God that can be a positive preface to the gospel. In his famous Nein to Emil Brunner’s appeal to an imago Dei as point of contact, Barth feared a slippery slope from nature to religion to ideology. Only in Christ and through the Spirit does God become known as the merciful Lord. Barth’s merits are real. He protected transcendence against immanentist theologies, insisted on the primacy of God’s act, and stressed the Christological center of revelation. But by cordoning off general revelation as at best ambiguous witness and at worst a pathway to idolatry, Barth’s program refuses the plain sense of Romans 1 and Psalm 19. It blunts biblical claims about culpable suppression, and it obscures the creational ground for moral law and civil life. Moreover, Barth’s tendency to locate revelation exclusively in existential encounter risks undercutting the covenantal and cognitive character of the prophetic and apostolic Word. A Reformed defense of general revelation can absorb Barth’s warning without adopting his denial.

Cornelius Van Til brought these tensions into sharp relief in the twentieth century by articulating a covenantal, antithetical, and analogical philosophy of revelation and knowledge. For Van Til the most basic fact is that all facts are what they are by virtue of God’s plan. God’s revelation is one, and it addresses man as covenant keeper or covenant breaker. General and special revelation are not two independent sources but two modes of the one self-revelation of the triune God, always interpreted by man either faithfully or rebelliously. This yields three crucial claims. First, because of the **noetic effects of sin**, there is no epistemically neutral ground from which fallen man can reason his way to God or judge revelation. Suppression is not ignorance but ethical revolt that distorts interpretation at the root. Second, unbelievers nevertheless know God truly from general revelation and cannot escape him. This knowledge is inescapable because the world and the self are revelatory, and because of their God-given **sensus divinitatis**. This is not contradiction: knowledge is real but suppressed. Third, natural theology must be reconceived, not as a set of proofs accessible from a neutral standpoint, but as a transcendental defense of the Christian worldview that shows the impossibility of the contrary. The apologetic method invokes the authority of special revelation from the outset and then argues that only on that basis can one make sense of the intelligibility of general revelation. Van Til’s doctrine of **analogical knowledge** guards Creator creature distinction and denies that man can be the original measure of truth. His refinement of Reformed **principia** insists that Scripture normatively interprets creation, while the Spirit renews the mind so that general revelation can be rightly read.

Within the Reformed house, debates have turned on the role of natural theology, the scope of **common grace**, and the structure of principia. One wing, drawing from Old Princeton, saw a greater symmetry with Thomistic tactics in arguing for God’s existence and for the trustworthiness of the Gospels, though the confessional theology remained robust. Another wing, intensified by Kuyper and Van Til, insisted that any appeal to natural reason must be self-consciously Christian, exposing the antithesis while also affirming a point of contact grounded in the image of God and common grace. The strongest Reformed consensus holds the following: general revelation is cognitive and universal, common grace preserves true knowledge among unbelievers, special revelation is necessary and sufficient for saving knowledge and normative for theology, and apologetics must be conducted in submission to Scripture while making full use of general revelation’s witness. The tension among Reformed thinkers is not whether general revelation is real, but how it can be properly deployed without smuggling in autonomy.

Outside the Reformed orbit, two large external pressures recur. The first is the classical Roman Catholic appeal to a fuller natural theology. Many contemporary Thomists, following Aquinas closely, maintain that rigorous metaphysics and phenomenology can deliver a robust theism and even some natural law ethics apart from Christian revelation. The Reformed response can embrace much of the metaphysics while insisting that the concrete practice of such a program, given the **noetic effects of sin**, cannot be hermeneutically innocent. It is legitimate for a Christian to articulate demonstrations of God’s existence or natural law, but these must be framed within and accountable to the Christian **principium cognoscendi**, lest the project capitulate to a fictional neutrality. The second pressure is the Barthian denial of natural theology. Here the Reformed answer appeals to Scripture’s ascription of real knowledge and culpability to all people and stresses that the problem is not nature but sin, not creation but suppression. Moreover, the doctrine of **divine simplicity** demands a unity of God’s revelatory activity such that the God who creates and sustains is not alien to the God who redeems in Christ. The cross is not the first time God speaks truly. Rather, in Christ and by Scripture the faithful finally read the world rightly.

Contemporary debates have reconfigured old lines. The analytic revival of natural theology has produced sophisticated cosmological, teleological, moral, and rationality arguments. Alvin Plantinga’s Reformed epistemology, though not a figure we develop here, clarifies that belief in God can be properly basic, warranted by the operation of a designed faculty, the sensus divinitatis, under the right conditions. This insight dovetails with Calvin and safeguards against the evidentialist demand that every belief be inferential. A Van Tilian can adopt this under a covenantal construal and add that the noetic malfunction due to sin means those conditions are not met salvifically apart from grace. Religious pluralism and the fate of the unevangelized press the doctrine with pastoral urgency. Romans 1 answers the latter starkly: general revelation renders all without excuse but does not grant saving knowledge; therefore the church must preach the gospel. General revelation is not a second path to God but the backdrop of judgment and the arena of God’s patience in **common grace**.

The relation of revelation to science raises another set of issues. General revelation includes the created order’s intelligibility, which grounds the possibility of science. But science, a human interpretive task, is not itself revelation. Here the principial structure is vital: Scripture does not function as a textbook in the empirical disciplines, yet it sets the metaphysical and ethical frame for all inquiry by identifying the world as creation, humans as image bearers, and nature as teleologically ordered. It also warns of **noetic effects of sin** in the practice of science. When conflicts appear between current scientific models and the Christian reading of Scripture, the Reformed theologian will assess whether the tension lies in misinterpretation of Scripture, in philosophical add-ons to scientific models, or in the fallibility of those models. General revelation cannot normatively correct Scripture, but it can occasion reconsideration of exegesis. The asymmetry remains: special revelation norms, general revelation is normed, though both remain divine acts.

At the level of public theology, the question of **natural law** and civil life cannot be evaded. General revelation grounds a common moral grammar by which societies can pursue relative justice. The Reformed tradition can affirm this while acknowledging the volatility of that grammar under sin. Here **federal theology** clarifies that humanity’s covenantal standing in Adam includes the retention of the work of the law on the heart and participation in civil good under the Noahic administration. Yet the church’s witness must not equate such common moral knowledge with the gospel. Natural law can guide public reasoning, but only the gospel can regenerate. The expectation of cultural consensus must be tempered by the reality of antithesis.

The doctrine of revelation also interlocks with theology proper and Christology. **Divine simplicity** secures the identity of God’s revelation with his being without collapsing Creator into creature. If God is simple, then God does not have a revelatory part; his revealing is a free act that manifests who he is. This rescues revelation from historicist domestication. In Christology, special revelation culminates in the incarnate Word. Jesus is not merely the bearer of revelation but its content and form. Yet to avoid Barthian reductionism, Christ’s revelatory identity does not negate prior and ongoing general revelation but fulfills it. The Logos who is incarnate is the Logos through whom all things were made and in whom all things hold together. In bibliology, Scripture is God’s covenantal Word written, the authoritative and sufficient witness to Christ that serves as the canon for the church’s faith and practice. Its sufficiency means that no extra-biblical revelation is needed for salvation or Christian living. Its clarity presupposes that God can communicate in human language as Lord of language. Its authority, as part of special revelation, is self-attesting. The Spirit does not create that authority but opens eyes to recognize it.

Anticipating examiners’ objections sharpens the position. Does affirming general revelation concede a path to God outside Christ and Scripture? No. The Reformed thesis is that general revelation yields true knowledge of God’s existence and power and of moral obligation, and that all suppress this knowledge apart from grace, incurring guilt. It is not salvific. Is Van Til’s critique of natural theology an overreach that forbids all arguments for God? Properly read, no. Van Til denies neutrality and autonomous reasoning, not argument as such. He urges that all reasoning occur within the Christian frame, employing a transcendental strategy that demonstrates the preconditions of intelligibility grounded in the triune God. Can one affirm Aquinas’s metaphysical arguments without capitulating to rationalism? Yes, if one subordinates them to the **principium cognoscendi** of Scripture, interprets them analogically, and acknowledges that the practice of reasoning is morally conditioned. Does the Barthian critique render Romans 1 obsolete? No. The church receives Romans 1 as dogmatically decisive: men know God and are without excuse. Barth’s warning should alert us to the corruptions of natural religion, not negate God’s self-disclosure in creation. Finally, can we maintain both the cognitive propositional content of revelation and its personal character? We must. Revelation is God’s personal self-disclosure in and through words and acts that bear cognitive content. The Word became flesh does not abolish words.

The position to defend, then, is a classically theistic and Reformed account of revelation. God, who is one and simple, freely discloses himself analogically to creatures. General revelation is universal, clear, and sufficient to ground true knowledge and universal guilt; it is not sufficient for salvation. Special revelation in Christ, attested inscripturally, is necessary and sufficient for saving knowledge and the normative interpreter of general revelation. The Reformed **principia** order theological knowing: God as principium essendi, Scripture as principium cognoscendi externum, the Spirit as principium cognoscendi internum. Within this stance one can affirm a chastened natural theology and a robust natural law under the constraints of **noetic effects of sin** and **common grace**. Aquinas supplies metaphysical clarity and analogical predication; Calvin locates knowledge within the drama of sin and grace; Bavinck integrates the unity of revelation and culture; Barth warns against natural religion while overstating the case; Van Til recasts the epistemic situation covenantally and apologetically. The integrated result preserves the universality of God’s witness in the world and the uniqueness of his saving Word, equipping the church to read both the book of Scripture and the book of nature under the light of Christ.
