# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the question of **general and special revelation** through the lens of existentialist philosophy and historical criticism. He famously rejected the possibility of **objective revelation** in nature or history, insisting that **revelation** occurs only as an existential encounter in the proclamation of the **kerygma**. For Bultmann, **special revelation** is not a deposit of supernatural information but the event in which the individual is confronted by the call to authentic existence through the message of Christ.

- "Revelation does not mean the imparting of supernatural truths, but the disclosure of authentic existence." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Existential Encounter**
    - Revelation is not propositional but occurs as a personal, existential event.
    - The **kerygma** confronts the hearer with a call to decision and authentic existence.
    - There is no revelation apart from faith; it is not accessible to objective observation.
    - Revelation is not a communication of facts but a summons to self-understanding before God.
    - "God does not reveal objective truths about Himself, but reveals Himself in the event of proclamation." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Demythologization of Revelation**
    - The biblical witness is clothed in mythological language that must be interpreted existentially.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind the myth.
    - Revelation is not tied to supernatural events but to their existential significance.
    - The task of theology is to translate myth into existential terms for modern hearers.
    - "What matters is not the mythological world picture but the existential truth to which it points." (New Testament and Mythology)

3. **Rejection of General Revelation**
    - Bultmann denies that God is revealed in nature or history apart from the kerygma.
    - There is no universal, accessible knowledge of God through creation.
    - Revelation is always particular, never general or available to reason.
    - Natural theology is incompatible with the New Testament understanding of revelation.
    - "There is no revelation of God in the world as such, but only in the word of proclamation." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Historical Criticism and Revelation**
    - The historical Jesus cannot be the object of faith; faith is in the proclaimed Christ.
    - Historical investigation cannot yield revelation, only the existential encounter can.
    - The Bible is a human witness to revelation, not revelation itself.
    - Faith does not rest on historical facts but on the existential call of the kerygma.
    - "Faith cannot be based on historical knowledge, but only on the word that addresses me here and now." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Revelation and Faith**
    - Revelation is inseparable from the act of faith; it is realized only in personal response.
    - Faith is not assent to doctrine but a radical reorientation of existence.
    - The event of revelation is the event of self-understanding before God.
    - Faith is the mode in which revelation is appropriated and becomes real.
    - "Revelation is not a thing to be possessed, but an event that happens to the individual in faith." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s radical approach to **revelation** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **biblical hermeneutics** and existentialist interpretation. His rejection of **general revelation** and insistence on the existential nature of **special revelation** challenged both traditional dogmatics and liberal theology. While his program of **demythologization** remains controversial, it forced theologians to grapple with the relationship between faith, history, and proclamation in the modern world. Bultmann’s influence endures in ongoing debates about the nature of revelation and the task of theology in a secular age.
