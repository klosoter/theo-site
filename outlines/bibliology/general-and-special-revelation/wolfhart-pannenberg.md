# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg developed a distinctive approach to **general and special revelation** by emphasizing the historical nature of **God’s self-disclosure**. He argued that **revelation** is not a static deposit but an event that unfolds in history, culminating in the resurrection of Christ, and is accessible to all through **universal history**. For Pannenberg, the distinction between general and special revelation is ultimately overcome in the eschatological manifestation of **truth**.

- "Revelation is not the communication of truths but the imparting of reality itself, the reality of God." (Revelation as History)

## Key Works

- Revelation as History (edited with R. E. C. Browne)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2
- Jesus—God and Man
- Theology and the Philosophy of Science

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Historical Event**
    - Revelation occurs within the fabric of **universal history**, not apart from it.
    - The resurrection of Jesus is the decisive historical event where **God’s self-revelation** is manifest.
    - History itself is the medium through which God communicates.
    - Revelation is accessible and open to public scrutiny, not merely private or mystical.
    - "God’s revelation is not a private event but a public event in history." (Revelation as History)

2. **Unity of General and Special Revelation**
    - The distinction between general and special revelation is provisional, not absolute.
    - Both forms of revelation converge in the eschatological fulfillment of history.
    - All people have access to revelation through the openness of historical events.
    - Special revelation clarifies and fulfills what is ambiguously present in general revelation.
    - "The distinction between general and special revelation is overcome in the eschatological consummation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Revelation as Self-Disclosure of God**
    - Revelation is not primarily propositional but the self-giving of God in history.
    - God’s reality is imparted, not just information about God.
    - The person and work of Christ are the center of this self-disclosure.
    - Revelation is dynamic, involving both event and interpretation.
    - "Revelation is the imparting of the reality of God, not merely the communication of truths." (Revelation as History)

4. **Eschatological Orientation of Revelation**
    - Full understanding of revelation awaits the end of history.
    - Present revelation is provisional and anticipatory of final consummation.
    - The meaning of all history is revealed only in the eschaton.
    - The openness of history points forward to its ultimate fulfillment in God.
    - "Only at the end of history will the truth of revelation be fully manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Rational and Public Character of Revelation**
    - Revelation must be accessible to rational inquiry and historical investigation.
    - Faith is not opposed to reason but invites critical engagement.
    - The public nature of revelation guards against subjectivism.
    - The resurrection is a publicly accessible event, not a private experience.
    - "Revelation must be open to rational scrutiny if it is to claim universal validity." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to **revelation** has significantly shaped modern theology by insisting on the public, historical, and rational character of God’s self-disclosure. His emphasis on the unity of **general and special revelation** challenged traditional dichotomies and encouraged a more integrated, eschatologically oriented understanding. Pannenberg’s work continues to influence discussions on the relationship between faith, history, and reason, especially within ecumenical and dialogue-based contexts.
