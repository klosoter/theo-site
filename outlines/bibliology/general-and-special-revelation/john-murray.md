# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robust distinction between **general revelation** and **special revelation**, emphasizing their respective roles in the knowledge of God. He maintained that while **general revelation** renders all humanity without excuse before God, only **special revelation**—culminating in **Scripture**—provides the redemptive knowledge necessary for salvation.

- "General revelation is revelation given to all men as men, and it is given in the works of creation and providence." ("The Nature and Authority of Scripture," Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Key Works

- "The Nature and Authority of Scripture" (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT Commentary)
- "Calvin on Scripture and Divine Sovereignty" (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)
- "Revelation and Inspiration" (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)
- "The Theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith" (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General Revelation is Universal and Sufficient for Condemnation**
    - General revelation is accessible to all people through **creation and providence**.
    - It reveals the existence, power, and divine nature of God.
    - This revelation leaves humanity "without excuse" regarding God's reality.
    - However, it does not provide the knowledge necessary for salvation.
    - "General revelation is not redemptive in character but is sufficient to render men inexcusable." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

2. **Special Revelation is Redemptive and Necessary for Salvation**
    - Special revelation is given through **historical acts** and **verbal communication** culminating in Scripture.
    - It reveals God's will, redemptive plan, and the person and work of Christ.
    - Only through special revelation can sinners come to saving knowledge of God.
    - Special revelation is necessary due to the effects of the Fall and human inability.
    - "It is only in the special revelation of the gospel that the way of salvation is disclosed." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

3. **Scripture as the Culmination of Special Revelation**
    - The **Bible** is the final and complete form of special revelation.
    - Scripture is inspired, authoritative, and sufficient for faith and life.
    - All previous forms of special revelation are subordinate to and fulfilled in Scripture.
    - The canon is closed; no new special revelation is given.
    - "The Bible is the deposit of special revelation and is itself revelation in written form." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

4. **Noetic Effects of Sin on General Revelation**
    - The Fall has corrupted human ability to interpret general revelation rightly.
    - Sin leads to suppression and distortion of the truth revealed in creation.
    - Only by the regenerating work of the **Holy Spirit** can one rightly apprehend God's revelation.
    - This underscores the necessity of special revelation and grace.
    - "Because of sin, the light of general revelation is darkened and perverted in the minds of men." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

5. **Continuity and Distinction Between General and Special Revelation**
    - Both forms of revelation originate from the same God and are ultimately harmonious.
    - General revelation provides the context for special revelation.
    - Special revelation interprets and fulfills what is latent in general revelation.
    - The distinction must be maintained to avoid confusion of nature and grace.
    - "There is continuity between general and special revelation, but also a distinction that must not be blurred." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of the relationship between **general and special revelation** has shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of **revelation** and **Scripture**. His insistence on the necessity and sufficiency of special revelation for salvation remains influential in confessional circles. Murray’s work continues to inform debates on natural theology, the authority of the Bible, and the effects of sin on human knowledge of God. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to the primacy of **Scripture** within the Reformed tradition.
