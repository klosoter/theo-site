# Henri Blocher (1937– )

Henri Blocher approaches **general and special revelation** with a strong commitment to the authority of **Scripture** while maintaining a nuanced appreciation for the role of **natural revelation**. He affirms that **general revelation** genuinely discloses God’s existence and attributes but insists that only **special revelation**—culminating in Christ and the biblical canon—provides the saving knowledge necessary for redemption.

- "General revelation is real, but it is not sufficient; it is the gospel, the special revelation, that brings salvation." (In the Beginning)

## Key Works

- In the Beginning: The Opening Chapters of Genesis
- Evil and the Cross: An Analytical Look at the Problem of Pain
- Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle
- “Revelation” in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson, David Wright)
- “General Revelation” in New Dictionary of Biblical Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General revelation is real but limited**
    - God reveals Himself in creation, history, and conscience to all humanity.
    - This revelation is sufficient to render people without excuse before God.
    - General revelation communicates God’s power, divinity, and moral order.
    - It does not provide the knowledge necessary for salvation.
    - "General revelation is not a saving revelation, but it is a true one." (New Dictionary of Theology)

2. **Special revelation is necessary for salvation**
    - Special revelation is God’s self-disclosure in redemptive history, culminating in Christ.
    - Scripture is the normative and authoritative form of special revelation.
    - Only through special revelation can humanity know God’s will for salvation.
    - The gospel message is not accessible through general revelation alone.
    - "The gospel is a message that comes from outside the world, a word from God that cannot be deduced from nature." (In the Beginning)

3. **Scripture as the supreme authority**
    - The Bible is the inspired, infallible record of special revelation.
    - All claims about God must be tested by the biblical witness.
    - Scripture interprets both general and special revelation.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are foundational for theology.
    - "Scripture is the touchstone by which all revelation must be measured." (New Dictionary of Theology)

4. **Christ as the center of revelation**
    - Jesus Christ is the ultimate and fullest expression of God’s self-revelation.
    - All previous revelation finds its fulfillment and meaning in Christ.
    - The person and work of Christ are accessible only through special revelation.
    - Christ is the hermeneutical key to understanding both general and special revelation.
    - "The fullness of revelation is found in the person of Christ, not in nature." (In the Beginning)

5. **The noetic effects of sin**
    - Human sinfulness distorts the reception and interpretation of general revelation.
    - Fallen humanity suppresses the truth revealed in creation.
    - Special revelation is needed to overcome the blindness caused by sin.
    - The Holy Spirit is necessary to illuminate both general and special revelation.
    - "Sin blinds us to the message of creation; grace opens our eyes to the truth." (Original Sin)

## Legacy and Impact

Blocher’s nuanced articulation of **general and special revelation** has influenced evangelical and Reformed theology, particularly in French-speaking contexts. His insistence on the necessity and sufficiency of **special revelation** upholds the centrality of Scripture and Christ in theological method. Blocher’s work continues to shape discussions on the relationship between **natural theology** and biblical revelation, emphasizing both the reality of God’s disclosure in creation and the indispensable role of the gospel.
