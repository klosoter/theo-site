# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge distinguished sharply between **general revelation**—God’s self-disclosure in nature and providence—and **special revelation**, which is God’s redemptive communication through **Scripture** and the person of Christ. For Hodge, general revelation renders all people accountable before God, but only special revelation provides the knowledge necessary for **salvation** and the proper understanding of God’s will.

- "The works of God reveal his eternal power and Godhead; but the knowledge thus derived is altogether insufficient for our salvation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on revelation and theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General Revelation is Universal and Sufficient for Condemnation**
    - All people receive knowledge of God through creation and conscience.
    - This revelation demonstrates God’s **existence**, **power**, and **moral law**.
    - It leaves humanity without excuse for unbelief or idolatry.
    - However, it does not provide the means of salvation.
    - "The light of nature is sufficient to leave men without excuse, but not sufficient to lead them to God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Special Revelation is Necessary for Salvation**
    - Special revelation is given through **Scripture** and culminates in Christ.
    - It reveals truths about God’s character, redemption, and the way of salvation.
    - Without special revelation, the gospel and saving knowledge remain inaccessible.
    - Special revelation is propositional, clear, and authoritative.
    - "Without a supernatural revelation, man could never have attained the knowledge of the plan of salvation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Scripture as the Norm of Special Revelation**
    - The Bible is the inspired, inerrant record of special revelation.
    - Scripture alone is the final authority for faith and practice.
    - All other claims to revelation must be tested by Scripture.
    - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture are foundational.
    - "The Scriptures are the only infallible rule of faith and practice." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Harmony but Distinction Between General and Special Revelation**
    - Both forms of revelation come from the same God and cannot ultimately contradict.
    - General revelation prepares the way for special revelation.
    - Special revelation interprets and fulfills what is only partially known in general revelation.
    - The distinction safeguards the uniqueness of the gospel.
    - "Revelation in nature and revelation in the Bible are not antagonistic, but harmonious." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Revelation and Human Reason**
    - Human reason can apprehend general revelation but is limited by sin.
    - Reason is a servant, not a judge, of special revelation.
    - Faith is necessary to receive and rightly interpret special revelation.
    - The noetic effects of sin necessitate divine illumination.
    - "Reason must be subject to the Scriptures, and not the Scriptures to reason." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **general and special revelation** became foundational for later Reformed theology, especially in the Princeton tradition. His insistence on the authority and sufficiency of **Scripture** shaped evangelical approaches to revelation and apologetics. Hodge’s careful distinctions continue to inform debates on natural theology, biblical authority, and the relationship between faith and reason. His legacy endures in systematic theology and confessional Reformed circles.
