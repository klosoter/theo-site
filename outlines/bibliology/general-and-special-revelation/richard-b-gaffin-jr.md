# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. emphasizes the inseparability of **general** and **special revelation** within the Reformed tradition, arguing that both are unified in their source and purpose but distinct in content and function. He maintains that **special revelation** is necessary for a saving knowledge of God, while **general revelation** renders all humanity accountable before Him, and both are ultimately fulfilled and interpreted through **Christ** and **Scripture**.

- "General revelation is always subordinate to and interpreted by special revelation, especially as it is now inscripturated." (Revelation and Tradition, 2008)

## Key Works

- Revelation and Tradition: In Defense of Van Til’s Doctrine of Revelation and Inspiration (2008)
- God’s Word in Servant-Form: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck on the Doctrine of Scripture (2008)
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit (1979)
- Articles in Westminster Theological Journal on revelation and hermeneutics
- Contributions to Theonomy and Eschatology: Reformed Perspectives (1986)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of General and Special Revelation**
   - Both forms of revelation originate from the triune God and are not ultimately independent.
   - **General revelation** provides a universal witness to God’s existence and attributes.
   - **Special revelation** is necessary for redemptive knowledge and is climactically revealed in Christ.
   - The two are coordinated, with special revelation interpreting general revelation.
   - "General and special revelation are not two separate sources of truth but are united in their divine origin and purpose." (Revelation and Tradition)

2. **Necessity of Special Revelation for Salvation**
   - **General revelation** is insufficient for a saving knowledge of God due to human sinfulness.
   - **Special revelation** provides the redemptive message culminating in the gospel.
   - The **Scriptures** are the definitive form of special revelation for the church today.
   - Christ is the center and fulfillment of all special revelation.
   - "Only special revelation, as now inscripturated, brings the knowledge of salvation in Christ." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

3. **Christocentric Focus of Revelation**
   - All revelation, both general and special, finds its ultimate meaning in Christ.
   - The **incarnation** is the supreme act of special revelation.
   - Christ interprets and fulfills the witness of general revelation.
   - The church’s proclamation is grounded in the Christ-centered nature of revelation.
   - "The person and work of Christ are the heart of God’s self-disclosure." (Revelation and Tradition)

4. **Authority and Sufficiency of Scripture**
   - **Scripture** is the normative and final form of special revelation.
   - The authority of Scripture is rooted in its divine origin and inspiration.
   - Scripture interprets all other forms of revelation, including general revelation.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture is essential for faith and practice.
   - "Scripture is the inscripturated Word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and life." (God’s Word in Servant-Form)

5. **Reformed Epistemology and the Noetic Effects of Sin**
   - Human interpretation of both general and special revelation is affected by sin.
   - Only through the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit can one rightly understand revelation.
   - The **antithesis** between belief and unbelief shapes all knowledge of God.
   - Reformed epistemology insists on the necessity of grace for true knowledge.
   - "Sin does not erase general revelation but distorts its reception and understanding." (Revelation and Tradition)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has reinforced the **Reformed doctrine of revelation**, particularly in its insistence on the unity and distinction between general and special revelation. His Christocentric and redemptive-historical approach has shaped contemporary discussions on the authority of Scripture and the interpretation of revelation. Gaffin’s influence is evident in the ongoing commitment of Westminster Theological Seminary and the broader Reformed community to uphold the primacy of special revelation in Christ and Scripture.
