### ESSAY
To speak of **general revelation** and **special revelation** is to ask how the one, simple, triune God makes himself and his will known, and how such knowledge stands under the conditions of creatureliness and sin. The conceptual nerve is this: there is one self-revealing God, yet two ordered modes and ends of revelation. **General revelation** denotes God’s universal, constant, nonredemptive disclosure of himself in the created order and in human conscience so that all people truly know God and are without excuse. **Special revelation** denotes God’s particular, redemptive self-disclosure in saving words and deeds culminating in Jesus Christ and now inscripturated in the canon of Scripture. The central dogmatic claim I will defend is that there is no epistemic dualism in God, no second deity of nature beside the God of grace. There is one **self-attesting** Lord whose revelation is clear and authoritative in both modes, but whose saving knowledge is annexed to **covenant** and therefore to **special revelation**.

The patristic ground for this distinction is laid above all in Augustine. Augustine’s account of revelation is not given under the later labels of general and special revelation, but his theology systematically presupposes their ordered distinction. In Confessions and The City of God he treats creation itself as a kind of book, a **general revelation** in which the invisible God is manifested in his works. Creatures are signs pointing beyond themselves. Augustine’s doctrine of **illumination** arises here: though the created order declares God, the mind must be turned by the inner teacher, the Word, to perceive it aright. This anticipates later Reformed insistence on the noetic effects of sin. Moreover, in De Trinitate and his preaching on the Psalms, Augustine expounds Scripture as **special revelation**, the authoritative interpretation of God’s acts in history culminating in Christ. Scripture is not merely an addition to some preexisting neutral knowledge of God but the covenantal address that rightly orders all creaturely signs.

Examiners will press hard here: does Augustine not thereby collapse general revelation into special, since illumination through Christ is needed to see creation rightly? The answer must be nuanced. For Augustine, pagans truly know something of God from the creature, enough to render them without excuse, but they lack the charity and right orientation that only grace gives. He never denies that the created order objectively manifests God. Rather, he insists that subjective appropriation is impaired. This anticipates the later distinction between the objective clarity of **general revelation** and the subjective suppression of that revelation described in Romans 1.

John Calvin receives and sharpens this Augustinian trajectory, giving the classic Reformed formulation. In the opening chapters of the Institutes and his commentary on Romans 1, Calvin articulates two key conceptual anchors. First, the **sensus divinitatis**, an inborn sense of deity whereby all men are naturally endowed with a knowledge that there is a God, accompanied by some awareness of his power and divinity. Second, the metaphor of the world as a theater of God’s glory, in which the whole ordering, beauty, and governance of creation are a clear mirror of the Creator. For Calvin, **general revelation** is not a dim guess; it is a bright theater and an ineradicable sense. The problem lies not in the revelation but in the human heart. The fall has not eradicated the sensus divinitatis, but has corrupted its operation, producing superstition, idolatry, and evasion.

Calvin is often caricatured as denying any **natural theology**, but he must be read carefully. He denies a natural theology that would construct saving knowledge of God or a true theology of his favor apart from **special revelation**, not the reality of natural knowledge. Calvin thus insists that this general knowledge is sufficient for two things: to render humanity inexcusable and to provide a natural point of contact for **special revelation**. When Scripture speaks, it does not address a blank slate but a twisted yet inescapable awareness of God. The Reformed scholastics, in continuity with Calvin, develop this within a broader **federal theology**, speaking of a prelapsarian **covenant of works** in which Adam’s knowledge of God included both what we would call general and special revelation, later refracted through the fall.

Here an internal debate emerges within the Reformed tradition. How far can one develop a positive **natural theology** from **general revelation**? The older Protestant scholastics, especially in the post-Reformation orthodox period, generally affirmed a limited natural theology: from created effects one can reason analogically to certain attributes of God such as existence, power, wisdom, goodness. They insisted that this **analogical knowledge** was real but partial, and never sufficient to attain the knowledge of God as reconciled in Christ. This stands in contrast to the more expansive Roman Catholic development, culminating in the neo-Thomist **analogia entis**, a doctrine of a real analogy of being between God and creatures. There the affirmation of a robust natural theology, accessible to unaided reason, was codified in the First Vatican Council’s teaching that God’s existence can be known with certainty from created things.

The Reformed critique of the **analogia entis** is not a rejection of analogy per se, but of an ontology and epistemology that, in their view, compromise **divine aseity** and **divine simplicity**, and grant fallen reason an autonomy incompatible with total dependence on God’s self-revelation. Here Karl Barth will later famously call the analogia entis “the invention of Antichrist,” a judgment most Reformed thinkers would consider excessive but which highlights the concern that nature be read from within the economy of grace, not against it. In an examination, one must carefully distinguish the Reformed affirmation of analogical predication, grounded in **creator–creature distinction**, from the rejection of the Thomistic system as a whole.

The modern problem-field intensifies these issues. Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield, as a leading figure of Old Princeton, is decisive for how many evangelicals conceive **general revelation** and **special revelation**. Warfield operates with a strong conception of **inerrant Scripture** as **special revelation** and a robust, though not autonomous, conception of natural theology grounded in **general revelation**. In works like Revelation and Inspiration, he argues that **special revelation** is historically mediated through miracles and prophecy, and that it culminates in Christ and Scripture. He is willing to employ inductive and historical arguments from **general revelation** and from the facts of Christian history to argue for the trustworthiness of Scripture and the deity of Christ. While Warfield remains a confessional Calvinist, he often sounds congenial to the evidentialist apologetic tradition.

Warfield’s position raises key internal and external questions. Internally: does his approach overestimate the capacity of fallen reason to evaluate evidence from **general revelation** neutrally, thereby softening Calvin’s darker anthropology? Externally: does his alignment with common sense realism and Scottish philosophy of mind render his theology vulnerable to later critiques of foundationalism? A Westminster examiner will probe whether one can affirm Warfield’s high view of Scripture while rejecting some of his epistemological assumptions. The defensible Reformed response is to distinguish his dogmatic affirmations from his apologetic method. One can affirm that **general revelation** provides real evidences and that **special revelation** bears confirmatory signs, while insisting that the acceptance of these evidences as what they really are depends on a prior, Spirit-wrought submission to God’s authority. This prepares the way for Cornelius Van Til.

Before turning to Van Til, however, one must reckon with Karl Barth, arguably the most influential modern critic of natural theology and a decisive figure in any account of revelation. In the Church Dogmatics, especially in volume I.1, Barth sets **revelation** strictly in the event of God’s free self-disclosure in Jesus Christ. For Barth, God is known only where and when God gives himself to be known. This leads him to a severe critique of all attempts to speak of God from a general knowledge of being or from historical experience outside of Christ. The famous exchange with Emil Brunner over “natural theology” encapsulates this. Brunner argues for a modest doctrine of **imago Dei** and a remnant of a formal point of contact in human nature. Barth replies with an unqualified “Nein”, fearing that any appeal to a point of contact in human nature or in general history leads inevitably to idolatrous religion and a domestication of God’s sovereignty in revelation.

Barth’s intention is to safeguard the primacy and freedom of **special revelation** in Christ, and to insist that revelation is not an object at human disposal but an event of divine lordship. Yet this comes at a cost. Barth tends to reduce **general revelation** to a retroactive correlate of faith’s recognition of Christ’s lordship over all. The Reformed confessions, especially the Westminster Confession of Faith chapter 1, affirm that “the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence” manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, so as to leave men inexcusable, while also insisting that such revelation is not sufficient for salvation. Barth is reluctant to grant that there is an objective, universally accessible revelation of God in creation that exists independently of faith’s response.

The Reformed critique of Barth, which I defend, is not that he exalts Christ and Scripture too highly, but that he construes revelation so evental and confined to saving encounter that he undermines the catholic teaching of Romans 1 and Psalm 19. If one denies that all humans truly know God from **general revelation**, one cannot explain universal culpability for idolatry. A careful defense must distinguish between acknowledging the dangers of a speculative **natural theology** that claims God as an object and the necessity of affirming that God really speaks through his works and providence to all humans, even if that speech is consistently misheard and suppressed.

Cornelius Van Til, operating from within the Westminster tradition, reconfigures the relation of **general revelation** and **special revelation** in light of both Old Princeton and Barth. Van Til agrees with Barth’s rejection of an autonomous natural theology, but faults him for denying the objectivity and clarity of **general revelation**. Van Til insists on two core commitments. First, the **self-attesting Scripture** is the principium cognoscendi of theology. All knowledge of God, including right understanding of **general revelation**, depends on **special revelation**. Second, **general revelation** is inescapable and clear: all facts are God-created facts and therefore revelational; every human thought is conducted in a world already interpreted by God.

Van Til’s distinctive contribution is to insist that there is no polyvalent “brute fact” that can be interpreted apart from the Christian God. This leads to his presuppositional apologetic: any use of **general revelation** in argument must be conducted from the standpoint of biblical theism, not as a neutral common ground. Yet Van Til is emphatic that all humans possess **covenant** knowledge of God. The covenant with Adam, broken in sin, still structures reality. Fallen humanity is in a relationship of ethical rebellion, not metaphysical ignorance. The knowledge given in **general revelation** is suppressed, not absent. Hence, Van Til can affirm with Calvin that humans “know God and do not know him” simultaneously: they know him truly in order to rebel against him, but do not know him in love and trust.

Examiner pressure will come here: does Van Til’s ordering of **special revelation** as principial for knowledge of **general revelation** entail that unbelievers do not really know God from nature? The answer lies in his distinction between principial and actual knowledge. Principially, the Christian worldview, disclosed in Scripture, is necessary to account for the intelligibility of any fact. Actually, unbelievers as image bearers cannot help but know God as he confronts them through creation and conscience. They depend on this knowledge to conduct science, morality, and reasoning, even while morally denying the One who grounds it. This avoids Barth’s tendency to ground revelation solely in the event of faith, while also avoiding Old Princeton’s sometimes naively neutral epistemologies.

With these figures in view, the internal, external, and contemporary debates around **general revelation** and **special revelation** can be drawn together. Internally, within the Reformed tradition, three questions dominate. First, how robust is **general revelation**? Calvin and Van Til affirm its clarity and sufficiency for condemnation and point of contact, but stress its utter insufficiency for the gospel. Some Reformed thinkers, influenced by analytic philosophy, have sought to retrieve a more extensive positive **natural theology**, sometimes following Alvin Plantinga’s model of properly basic belief in God anchored in the **sensus divinitatis**, or in arguments like the fine-tuning argument. A defended Reformed position can affirm arguments from **general revelation** as legitimate while insisting that their persuasive force is morally and spiritually conditioned.

Second, what is the relation between **general revelation** and **special revelation**? Is **special revelation** merely a subset of revelation about redemptive facts, or does it also re-interpret and complete what is known from creation? The stronger Reformed view, which I affirm, sees Scripture not only as adding new information but as giving the true interpretation of all things, including those already known from **general revelation**. Scripture functions as spectacles, to use Calvin’s metaphor, bringing the already revealed but blurred theater of the world into proper focus. Thus **special revelation** has hermeneutical primacy without eliminating the reality of **general revelation**.

Third, how do these doctrines inform apologetics? Here the tension between evidentialist and presuppositional strategies arises. The defended position is that while one may present arguments from design or morality grounded in **general revelation**, one must present them as expressions of a full-orbed Christian ontology and epistemology, not as autonomous probabilities. The unbeliever’s problem is not lack of data but ethical rebellion; thus the apologetic encounter is fundamentally covenantal and confrontational, not neutral.

Externally, the Enlightenment’s rationalism and empiricism reconfigured the debate. General revelation was often reduced to the deist’s “natural religion,” a minimal set of truths about God supposedly accessible to all reasonable persons prior to and apart from any **special revelation**. Special revelation was then either rejected as superstition or domesticated as a popular republication of what reason already knows. Against this, the Reformed position insists that **general revelation** and reason do not yield the gospel and are not salvifically sufficient. Moreover, **general revelation** is never a neutral deliverance of impersonal reason but always the voice of the triune God, received or suppressed in a covenantal context.

Modern science has also become an external pressure point. Some construe “nature” as a closed system of cause and effect, leaving no room for divine speech. The Reformed doctrine of **providence** insists that there is no such closure. The regularities studied by science are themselves divine speech, testimonies to the faithfulness and wisdom of the Creator. **General revelation** includes these lawful regularities, which when rightly interpreted give glory to God. Conflict arises not between revelation and science per se, but between rival interpretations of the same data under competing worldviews. Scripture as **special revelation** provides rules for reading the world, even as the world confirms Scripture’s depiction of a created, ordered, fallen, and providentially governed reality.

Contemporary debates stretch the doctrine further. Religious pluralism raises the question whether diverse religions are all partial receptions of a common **general revelation**, or whether they are fundamentally diverse narratives with no shared revelational core. The defended position, following Romans 1, sees false religions as parasitic distortions of a true yet suppressed knowledge of God. They are not neutral paths up the same mountain but rebellious misreadings of the same **general revelation**. This allows a measure of “truth in error” while denying soteriological parity.

Postmodern critiques of metanarrative and of the subject’s access to truth challenge the very notion of universal **general revelation**. Here, again, the Reformed doctrine of **analogical knowledge** is crucial. Human knowledge is finite, situated, and mediated, but this does not entail relativism because it is grounded in the archetypal knowledge of God himself. God’s self-revelation is accommodated to creaturely capacity, not imprisoned within cultural-linguistic games. The universality of **general revelation** rests not on a modernist ideal of disembodied reason but on the fact that all creatures live coram Deo, before the face of God, and are addressed by him through his works.

Finally, analytic philosophy of religion has rehabilitated discussions of religious epistemology. Plantinga’s Reformed epistemology, though not strictly identical with classical Reformed dogmatics, aligns well with Calvin and Van Til in emphasizing that belief in God can be rational, warranted, and properly basic without inferential argument. The **sensus divinitatis** functions as a design plan for knowing God, triggered by the experience of the world. This is a philosophically refined account of **general revelation** functioning in a noetic role. Nevertheless, a dogmatic correction is needed: the suppression of truth in unrighteousness means that the sensus does not simply operate as designed; its deliverances are twisted. Hence, any account of basic theistic belief must be tied to the renewing work of the Spirit through **special revelation** if it is to yield saving knowledge.

In sum, a coherent Reformed doctrine of **general revelation** and **special revelation** must hold together five affirmations. First, God, the triune Creator, freely wills to be known and does speak. **Divine simplicity** and **aseity** do not render God mute but guarantee that his self-revelation is an act of his own lordly freedom. Second, **general revelation** is real, universal, and clear: through creation, providence, and conscience, God makes known his eternal power and divine nature so that all humans truly know God and are without excuse. Third, sin does not erase but corrupts this knowledge, producing suppression, idolatry, and distorted religions. Hence, **general revelation** is sufficient to condemn but not to save. Fourth, **special revelation** is God’s redemptive self-disclosure in history, culminating in the incarnate Word and inscripturated in the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures, which function as a sufficient, clear, and final rule of faith and life. Fifth, **special revelation** has hermeneutical primacy: it does not sit alongside **general revelation** as a second source, but interprets it, restores its right use, and situates all knowledge in the covenantal drama of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation.

Any attempt to defend **general revelation** and **special revelation** before rigorous examiners must show doctrinal coherence across loci. **Providence** explains the constancy of **general revelation**. **Anthropology** and hamartiology explain its suppression. **Christology** grounds **special revelation** in the incarnate Word. **Pneumatology** explains the internal work necessary to receive both modes rightly. **Ecclesiology** locates **special revelation** in the church’s ministry of the Word and sacraments. **Eschatology** anticipates the beatific vision, where the distinction between general and special revelation gives way to the direct sight of God in Christ, yet without any contradiction to what we have already known by faith.

Thus understood, the doctrine avoids both rationalist natural theology and Barthian reductionism. It recognizes one speaking God, whose **general revelation** leaves all humanity without excuse and whose **special revelation** in Christ and Scripture brings sinners from culpable knowing-about to saving knowing-of the living God.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **General revelation** is God’s universal, nonredemptive self-disclosure in creation, providence, and conscience, sufficient for true but suppressible knowledge of God and for human culpability; **special revelation** is God’s particular, redemptive self-disclosure in word and act culminating in Christ and inscripturated Scripture, sufficient for saving knowledge and rightly interpreting general revelation.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: creation as a book of God, need for divine illumination, early form of the distinction.
  - Calvin: **sensus divinitatis**, world as theater of God’s glory, strong clarity of general revelation under severe noetic effects of sin.
  - Warfield: high **special revelation** in inerrant Scripture, robust yet evidentially used **general revelation**.
  - Barth: radical Christocentric **special revelation**, “Nein” to natural theology, reluctance to affirm objective general revelation.
  - Van Til: **self-attesting Scripture**, presuppositional use of **general revelation**, inescapable yet suppressed covenant knowledge of God.
- Debates:
  - Internal: scope of **natural theology**, clarity and usefulness of general revelation, evidentialist versus presuppositional apologetics, hermeneutical primacy of Scripture.
  - External: Enlightenment deism and autonomous reason, Roman Catholic **analogia entis**, Barth’s rejection of natural theology, scientific naturalism.
  - Contemporary: religious pluralism as distorted responses to general revelation, postmodern skepticism about universal truth, analytic Reformed epistemology on properly basic belief and the **sensus divinitatis**.
- Defended position: Classical Reformed view that the one triune God clearly reveals himself to all in **general revelation**, rendering them without excuse, but grants saving knowledge only through **special revelation** in Christ and Scripture, which also norms and rightly interprets all general revelation; there is no neutral natural theology, yet no denial of genuine, analogical, non-saving knowledge of God from creation.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Does Barth deny Romans 1 style general revelation? He affirms God’s universal lordship but effectively denies an objective, universally accessible revelation apart from Christ-event, which conflicts with Romans 1 and the Reformed confessions.
  - Can unbelievers “really” know God from general revelation? Yes, they know God truly but suppress that knowledge; the problem is ethical rebellion, not lack of data.
  - Is natural theology permissible in Reformed theology? A limited, analogical natural theology grounded in **general revelation** is permissible if subordinated to Scripture and not claimed as salvifically sufficient or religiously neutral.
  - How do general and special revelation relate? They are distinct yet inseparable; **special revelation** interprets and restores **general revelation**, while general revelation provides the inescapable context and point of contact for special revelation.
  - What apologetic method follows from this doctrine? Use arguments from **general revelation** within a presuppositional frame that challenges the unbeliever’s autonomous standards and calls them to submit to the **self-attesting** triune God revealed in Scripture.
