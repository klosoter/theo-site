# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame articulates a robust doctrine of **revelation** that emphasizes the inseparability and mutual reinforcement of **general and special revelation** within the context of God's lordship. He insists that all revelation is **covenantal** and inherently authoritative, with **general revelation** displaying God's character in creation and providence, and **special revelation** culminating in Scripture and Christ. Frame's **multiperspectivalism** shapes his approach, stressing that knowledge of God is always personal, situational, and normative.

- "God’s revelation is always personal, always authoritative, and always covenantal." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- Perspectives on the Word of God (1990)
- Apologetics to the Glory of God (1994)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Covenantal**
   - All revelation is given in the context of God's relationship with his people.
   - Both general and special revelation are expressions of God's lordship.
   - Revelation always entails divine authority and human responsibility.
   - The covenant frames how revelation is received and interpreted.
   - "Revelation is always a covenantal transaction between God and his people." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

2. **General and Special Revelation are Inseparable**
   - General and special revelation are not isolated but mutually interpretive.
   - Both forms of revelation communicate the same God and truth, though in different modes.
   - Special revelation clarifies and corrects misinterpretations of general revelation.
   - Human sin distorts general revelation, necessitating special revelation for salvation.
   - "General and special revelation are not two separate sources of knowledge, but two aspects of the one revelation of the Lord." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

3. **Multiperspectival Epistemology**
   - Knowledge of revelation involves normative (God’s Word), situational (creation, history), and existential (personal) perspectives.
   - No single perspective is sufficient; all are needed for a full understanding.
   - This approach guards against reductionism in understanding revelation.
   - Multiperspectivalism applies to both general and special revelation.
   - "Every act of knowing involves the subject, the object, and the standard." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

4. **Scripture as the Norming Norm**
   - Special revelation, especially Scripture, is the ultimate authority for interpreting all revelation.
   - Scripture provides the lens for rightly understanding general revelation.
   - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture are central to Frame’s doctrine.
   - General revelation is never rightly understood apart from the light of Scripture.
   - "Scripture is the divinely authorized interpretation of all reality." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Revelation is Always Personal and Authoritative**
   - God reveals himself, not merely information, in both general and special revelation.
   - Revelation always calls for a response of faith and obedience.
   - The personal nature of revelation reflects God’s lordship attributes: authority, control, and presence.
   - The authority of revelation is not diminished by its mode (general or special).
   - "God’s revelation is not merely propositional but also personal and existential." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s doctrine of **revelation** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially through his emphasis on the unity and authority of general and special revelation. His **multiperspectivalism** has provided a flexible yet rigorous framework for understanding epistemology and hermeneutics. Frame’s work continues to influence discussions on the relationship between Scripture, creation, and human knowledge, reinforcing the centrality of God’s lordship in all theological reflection.
