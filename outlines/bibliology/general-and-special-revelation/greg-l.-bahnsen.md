# Greg L. Bahnsen (1948–1995)

Greg L. Bahnsen, a leading figure in **Presuppositional Apologetics**, emphasized the absolute necessity of **special revelation** for true knowledge of God while affirming the reality and inescapability of **general revelation**. He argued that all people have access to **general revelation** through creation and conscience, but due to **sin**, only **special revelation**—culminating in Scripture—provides the foundation for saving knowledge and coherent reasoning.

- "God’s revelation in nature is clear and inescapable, but it is only through Scripture that we can properly interpret it." ("Van Til’s Apologetic: Readings & Analysis")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General Revelation is Universal and Clear**
    - All people receive knowledge of God through creation and providence.
    - This revelation renders humanity without excuse before God.
    - The clarity of general revelation is not diminished by human sin, but its acceptance is.
    - General revelation is sufficient for condemnation, not salvation.
    - "The created order continually confronts man with the inescapable reality of God’s existence and authority." (Always Ready)

2. **Special Revelation is Necessary for Salvation**
    - Only special revelation, particularly in Scripture, reveals the way of salvation.
    - The gospel cannot be derived from general revelation alone.
    - Special revelation provides the redemptive message centered in Christ.
    - The necessity of special revelation is grounded in the effects of the Fall.
    - "Without the Bible, man cannot know the saving truth about God and His will for redemption." (Van Til’s Apologetic)

3. **Noetic Effects of Sin on General Revelation**
    - Sin distorts human interpretation of general revelation.
    - Fallen humanity suppresses the truth revealed in nature.
    - The **antithesis** between belief and unbelief is rooted in response to revelation.
    - Only regeneration enables proper understanding of both general and special revelation.
    - "Unbelievers twist and suppress the revelation of God in creation due to their sinful nature." (Always Ready)

4. **Scripture as the Ultimate Interpretive Authority**
    - The Bible is the final standard for interpreting all revelation.
    - General revelation must be interpreted in light of special revelation.
    - Presuppositional apologetics insists on the necessity of biblical authority.
    - Scripture provides the worldview framework for understanding reality.
    - "Scripture is the necessary presupposition for intelligible experience and knowledge." (Van Til’s Apologetic)

5. **Covenantal Epistemology**
    - Knowledge is covenantally conditioned: believers and unbelievers interpret revelation differently.
    - The covenant relationship determines one’s response to revelation.
    - All reasoning is either in submission to or rebellion against God’s revelation.
    - Apologetics must address the presuppositions underlying one’s interpretation of revelation.
    - "There is no religiously neutral ground; all men are covenantally related to God in their knowing." (Presuppositional Apologetics: Stated and Defended)

## Legacy and Impact

Bahnsen’s robust articulation of **general and special revelation** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed apologetics, especially among those influenced by **Cornelius Van Til**. His insistence on the necessity of **special revelation** for epistemological coherence and salvation remains a hallmark of presuppositional methodology. Bahnsen’s writings continue to equip apologists to defend the faith by grounding all knowledge in the authority of Scripture and the inescapability of God’s self-disclosure.
