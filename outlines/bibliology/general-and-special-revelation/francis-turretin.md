# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin distinguished sharply between **general revelation** and **special revelation**, emphasizing their distinct roles in the knowledge of God. He argued that while **general revelation** through nature and conscience renders all people without excuse, only **special revelation**—culminating in **Scripture**—provides the knowledge necessary for **salvation** and true understanding of God's will.

- "Although the light of nature and the works of creation and providence are sufficient to render men inexcusable, yet they are not sufficient to lead them to the saving knowledge of God." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 1.3.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Topics 1–2)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Theological Questions (Quaestiones Theologicae Selectae)
- Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General revelation is real but insufficient for salvation**
    - God reveals himself universally through creation and providence.
    - This revelation is accessible to all people at all times.
    - It communicates God's existence, power, and some attributes.
    - It does not provide the knowledge necessary for redemption.
    - "General revelation is sufficient to convince men of sin, but not to convert them to God." (Institutes, 1.3.6)

2. **Special revelation is necessary for saving knowledge**
    - Special revelation is given through God's direct speech, prophecy, and ultimately Scripture.
    - Only special revelation discloses the way of salvation in Christ.
    - The content of special revelation surpasses what can be known by reason alone.
    - Without special revelation, humanity remains ignorant of the gospel.
    - "The knowledge of God as Redeemer is derived from special revelation alone." (Institutes, 1.3.7)

3. **Scripture as the supreme form of special revelation**
    - The Bible is the final and complete form of special revelation.
    - Scripture is inspired, authoritative, and sufficient for faith and practice.
    - All doctrines necessary for salvation are contained in Scripture.
    - Scripture interprets and clarifies the truths only dimly seen in general revelation.
    - "Scripture is the only and perfect rule of faith and practice." (Institutes, 1.2.4)

4. **The noetic effects of sin limit general revelation**
    - Human reason is corrupted by the Fall and cannot rightly interpret general revelation.
    - Sin leads to the suppression and distortion of the truth revealed in nature.
    - The clarity of general revelation is not enough to overcome human depravity.
    - Only by the Spirit and special revelation can true knowledge of God be restored.
    - "The natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God." (Institutes, 1.3.8)

5. **Harmony, not contradiction, between general and special revelation**
    - Both forms of revelation originate from the same God and are ultimately harmonious.
    - Apparent contradictions arise from human misunderstanding or sin.
    - Special revelation clarifies and corrects misinterpretations of general revelation.
    - The study of nature and Scripture should be pursued together, under the authority of Scripture.
    - "There is no real disagreement between the book of nature and the book of Scripture." (Institutes, 1.3.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous distinction between **general** and **special revelation** shaped later Reformed theology, especially in its doctrines of **Scripture** and **natural theology**. His articulation of the insufficiency of general revelation for salvation became a standard in confessional Reformed thought. Turretin’s influence persists in debates over the relationship between faith and reason, and his work remains foundational for understanding the necessity and sufficiency of special revelation in the Reformed tradition.
