# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner distinguished sharply between **general revelation** and **special revelation**, arguing that while all humans have access to a basic knowledge of God through creation and conscience, true **salvific knowledge** comes only through the **self-revelation of God in Christ**. He emphasized the limits of **natural theology** and the necessity of **divine initiative** for genuine encounter with God, positioning revelation as fundamentally personal and relational.

- "General revelation is real, but it is not sufficient for salvation; only in Christ does God reveal Himself fully." ("Nature and Grace")

## Key Works

- "Nature and Grace: A Discussion with Karl Barth"
- "The Divine-Human Encounter"
- "Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge"
- "Dogmatics: Volume I—The Christian Doctrine of God"
- "The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Reality of General Revelation**
    - Affirms that God is revealed in creation and human conscience.
    - Maintains that all people possess a basic awareness of God.
    - Sees general revelation as foundational for human responsibility before God.
    - Argues that general revelation is distorted by human sinfulness.
    - "There is a knowledge of God accessible to all men, but it is always ambiguous and incomplete." ("Nature and Grace")

2. **Necessity of Special Revelation**
    - Asserts that only in **Jesus Christ** does God reveal Himself fully and savingly.
    - Special revelation is historical and personal, not merely propositional.
    - The Bible is the unique witness to this special revelation.
    - Human beings cannot attain saving knowledge of God apart from divine initiative.
    - "Special revelation is the event in which God Himself comes to man." ("Revelation and Reason")

3. **Critique of Natural Theology**
    - Rejects the sufficiency of human reason to reach God unaided.
    - Argues that natural theology cannot bridge the gap caused by sin.
    - Engages critically with Roman Catholic and liberal Protestant approaches.
    - Emphasizes the need for grace to overcome human limitations.
    - "Nature cannot of itself lead to grace; grace must come to nature." ("Nature and Grace")

4. **Relational and Personal Character of Revelation**
    - Revelation is not mere information but a personal encounter.
    - God addresses humans as subjects, not objects.
    - True knowledge of God involves response and relationship.
    - Revelation is dynamic, not static.
    - "Revelation is always an event, an encounter between God and man." ("The Divine-Human Encounter")

5. **Sin’s Effect on Human Knowledge**
    - Human sin distorts perception of general revelation.
    - The image of God is marred but not destroyed in humanity.
    - Without the Holy Spirit, humans misinterpret or suppress general revelation.
    - Only through Christ can the knowledge of God be restored.
    - "Sin does not abolish the possibility of knowing God, but it makes it ambiguous and uncertain." ("Dogmatics I")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s nuanced distinction between **general and special revelation** shaped twentieth-century Protestant debates, especially in dialogue with Karl Barth. His insistence on the reality but insufficiency of general revelation influenced later discussions on **natural theology** and the limits of human reason. Brunner’s work remains a touchstone for those exploring the relationship between revelation, faith, and reason, and his emphasis on the personal nature of revelation continues to resonate in contemporary theology.
