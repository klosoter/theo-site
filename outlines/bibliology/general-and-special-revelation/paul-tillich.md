# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **general and special revelation** through the lens of his **method of correlation**, emphasizing the existential questions of humanity and the self-disclosure of the **Ground of Being**. He rejected a strict dichotomy between **natural theology** and **revelation**, instead arguing that revelation is the event in which the ultimate concern becomes manifest within the structures of human existence.

- "Revelation is the manifestation of the ground of being for human knowledge." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 1")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (1951)
- Dynamics of Faith (1957)
- The Protestant Era (1948)
- Theology of Culture (1959)
- The Courage to Be (1952)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Event**
   - Revelation is not a static deposit but an existential event.
   - It occurs when the **Ground of Being** communicates itself to human consciousness.
   - This event transcends the natural/supernatural divide.
   - Revelation is always mediated through symbols and history.
   - "Revelation is always an event in which the divine manifests itself to man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Correlation of Revelation and Human Existence**
   - Human existential questions provide the context for revelation.
   - Revelation answers the ultimate concerns rooted in human finitude and anxiety.
   - There is a dynamic interplay between human situation and divine self-disclosure.
   - The method of correlation seeks to relate theological answers to existential questions.
   - "The method of correlation explains the contents of the Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Symbolic Mediation**
   - All revelation is mediated through symbols that participate in the reality they signify.
   - Symbols open up levels of reality otherwise inaccessible to empirical knowledge.
   - Religious language about God is necessarily symbolic, not literal.
   - The Bible and Christ are primary symbols of revelation.
   - "Symbols participate in the reality to which they point." (Dynamics of Faith)

4. **Unity of General and Special Revelation**
   - Tillich denies a strict separation between general and special revelation.
   - Both are unified in the event of the divine self-manifestation.
   - General revelation is the ongoing presence of the divine ground in all being.
   - Special revelation is the decisive manifestation in historical events, especially in Christ.
   - "There is no revelation which is not at the same time general and special." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Revelation and Reason**
   - Reason is not opposed to revelation but is its necessary correlate.
   - Revelation presupposes the rational structure of human existence.
   - Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned, integrating reason and revelation.
   - Revelation critiques and fulfills reason, never bypassing it.
   - "Revelation is not irrational but transcends the limits of reason." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **general and special revelation** has profoundly influenced modern **systematic theology**, especially in existential and philosophical circles. His **method of correlation** provided a framework for engaging contemporary culture and philosophy with Christian doctrine. While some criticize his symbolic and existential emphasis as undermining traditional doctrines, his work remains a touchstone for discussions on the nature of **revelation** and the relationship between faith and reason. Tillich’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the mediation and universality of divine self-disclosure.
