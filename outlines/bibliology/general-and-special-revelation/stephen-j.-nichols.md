# Stephen J. Nichols (1970– )

Stephen J. Nichols approaches the doctrine of **general and special revelation** from a confessional Reformed perspective, emphasizing the clarity, sufficiency, and necessity of **Scripture** as special revelation. He underscores the universal witness of **general revelation** in creation and conscience, while maintaining that only **special revelation** in Christ and the Bible provides saving knowledge of God.

    - This revelation is clear enough to render humanity **without excuse** before God.
    - General revelation reveals God's **power**, **wisdom**, and **divine nature**.
    - It does not communicate the **gospel** or the way of salvation.
    - "General revelation tells us there is a God, but not how to be reconciled to Him." (Welcome to the Story)

2. **Special Revelation is Redemptive and Necessary**
    - Special revelation is given through **Scripture** and the person of **Jesus Christ**.
    - It is necessary for knowledge of **salvation** and the **covenant of grace**.
    - Special revelation is propositional, clear, and authoritative.
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables understanding and acceptance of special revelation.
    - "Without special revelation, we would remain in darkness regarding salvation." (Welcome to the Story)

3. **Scripture as the Culmination of Special Revelation**
    - The **Bible** is the final and complete form of special revelation.
    - Scripture is **inspired**, **inerrant**, and **sufficient** for faith and practice.
    - The canon of Scripture is closed; no new special revelation is given.
    - All claims of revelation must be tested by the written Word.
    - "God’s Word stands as the supreme authority for the church and the believer." (The Scriptures Are Trustworthy)

4. **Christ as the Center of Revelation**
    - Jesus Christ is the ultimate self-disclosure of God.
    - All special revelation points to and is fulfilled in Christ.
    - The **incarnation** is the climax of God’s redemptive revelation.
    - Understanding Christ is essential for rightly interpreting all revelation.
    - "In Christ, the fullness of God’s revelation is made manifest." (For Us and for Our Salvation)

5. **Revelation and the Reformed Tradition**

    - He draws on **Reformation** insights regarding the clarity and sufficiency of Scripture.
    - The distinction between general and special revelation safeguards the gospel.
