# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner’s theology of **general and special revelation** is marked by his insistence that all human beings have an innate openness to the **self-communication of God**, which he describes as the **supernatural existential**. He argues that **revelation** is not merely propositional but is fundamentally God’s personal self-gift, with **special revelation** in Christ as the fulfillment and clarification of the **transcendental experience** accessible to all.

- "God’s self-communication is always already offered to man in the depths of his existence." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Supernatural Existential**
    - Every human is endowed with a capacity for **God’s self-communication**.
    - This existential openness is not natural but a **graced condition**.
    - It grounds the possibility of **general revelation**.
    - It is universal, preceding explicit faith or knowledge of Christ.
    - "Man is always already the subject of a supernatural existential." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Transcendental Revelation**
    - Revelation is not only historical but also **transcendental** in human consciousness.
    - Human openness to mystery is itself a locus of **God’s revelation**.
    - This approach bridges **general** and **special revelation**.
    - It emphasizes the **subject’s experience** of God’s self-gift.
    - "Revelation is the self-communication of God to man in the event of his own existence." (Hearer of the Word)

3. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Revelation**
    - **Special revelation** in Christ is the definitive and normative self-disclosure of God.
    - Christ actualizes and interprets the **general revelation** present in all.
    - The incarnation is the historical climax of **God’s self-communication**.
    - All authentic revelation is oriented toward and completed in Christ.
    - "The event of Jesus Christ is the absolute and unsurpassable self-communication of God." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Unity of Revelation and Faith**
    - **Revelation** and **faith** are inseparable; faith is the acceptance of God’s self-gift.
    - Faith is possible because of the **supernatural existential**.
    - The act of faith is both a response to and a participation in revelation.
    - This unity undergirds the universality of salvation.
    - "Faith is the acceptance of God’s self-communication, which is always already offered." (Theological Investigations)

5. **Anonymous Christianity**
    - Those outside explicit Christian faith may still receive **God’s grace** through general revelation.
    - The concept of **anonymous Christians** affirms the universality of salvation’s possibility.
    - This does not negate the necessity or uniqueness of Christ.
    - It seeks to reconcile the **particularity of special revelation** with the universality of God’s salvific will.
    - "A non-Christian can, by God’s grace, be an anonymous Christian." (Theological Investigations)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s theology of **general and special revelation** has profoundly shaped modern Catholic thought, especially in the context of **Vatican II** and its openness to non-Christian religions. His concept of the **supernatural existential** and the universality of God’s self-communication have influenced ecumenical and interreligious dialogue. Rahner’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between **nature and grace**, and the possibility of salvation outside explicit Christian faith.
