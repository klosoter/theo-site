# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a classic **Reformed distinction** between **general revelation**—God’s self-disclosure in creation and providence—and **special revelation**—God’s redemptive self-disclosure through Scripture and Christ. They affirm that while **general revelation** renders all people without excuse before God, only **special revelation** leads to saving knowledge of the gospel. This distinction undergirds the confessions’ doctrines of **Scripture**, **natural law**, and the **knowledge of God**.

- "We know him by two means: First, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe... Second, he makes himself more clearly and fully known to us by his holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General Revelation is Universal and Sufficient for Condemnation**
    - God reveals himself to all people through **creation, providence, and conscience**.
    - This revelation displays God’s **eternal power and divinity** but does not communicate the way of salvation.
    - All people are rendered **without excuse** for their unbelief and idolatry.
    - The **natural knowledge of God** is real but suppressed in unrighteousness.
    - "By the creation, preservation, and government of the universe... men cannot give any excuse." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

2. **Special Revelation is Necessary for Salvation**
    - The **Word of God** is required to know the gospel and the way of reconciliation.
    - **Scripture** reveals God’s will, character, and the promise of redemption in Christ.
    - Special revelation is **clearer and fuller** than general revelation.
    - Faith comes only through the **hearing of the Word**.
    - "He makes himself more clearly and fully known to us by his holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

3. **Scripture as the Norm of Special Revelation**
    - The **Holy Scriptures** are the only infallible rule for faith and life.
    - All doctrines must be tested by the **canonical books**.
    - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture are emphasized over tradition or private revelation.
    - The church is bound to the **written Word** for teaching and correction.
    - "We believe that those Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

4. **Natural Law and the Moral Order**
    - The **law of God** is written on the heart, providing a moral compass to all humanity.
    - Even the unregenerate retain some sense of **justice and order** from general revelation.
    - The **moral law** is further clarified and perfected in special revelation.
    - Civil government and society are accountable to the **natural law** revealed in creation.
    - "God gave his law... that we may know more and more our sinful nature." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 3)

5. **The Limits of Human Reason and the Need for Grace**
    - Human reason, though capable of discerning God’s existence, is **darkened by sin**.
    - Only the **Holy Spirit** enables true understanding and acceptance of special revelation.
    - The **canons reject Pelagianism**, affirming that grace is necessary for saving knowledge.
    - The **insufficiency of general revelation** highlights the necessity of Christ and the gospel.
    - "What is impossible for the law to do... God accomplishes by the power of the Holy Spirit." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Art. 6)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology’s doctrine of revelation**, establishing a clear distinction between **general and special revelation** that remains foundational in confessional Reformed churches. Their articulation of the necessity and sufficiency of **Scripture** has influenced subsequent confessions and catechisms. The confessions’ teaching on the limits of general revelation continues to inform Reformed apologetics, natural theology, and the church’s engagement with culture and philosophy.
