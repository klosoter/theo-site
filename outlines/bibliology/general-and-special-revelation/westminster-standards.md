# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **revelation**, distinguishing clearly between **general revelation**—God’s self-disclosure in creation and providence—and **special revelation**—God’s redemptive communication through Scripture. They affirm that while **general revelation** renders all people without excuse, only **special revelation** in the **Word of God** is sufficient for the knowledge of salvation.

- "The light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God, and of his will, which is necessary unto salvation." (Westminster Confession of Faith 1.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 1 and 21)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Q&A 1–5)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Q&A 1–3)
- The Directory for Public Worship
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **General Revelation is Universal and Sufficient for Condemnation**
    - God reveals Himself to all people through **creation** and **providence**.
    - This revelation displays God’s **power, wisdom, and goodness**.
    - It leaves humanity **without excuse** before God.
    - However, it does not communicate the way of **salvation**.
    - "The works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable." (WCF 1.1)

2. **Special Revelation is Necessary for Salvation**
    - The knowledge of **God’s will** and **salvation** requires special revelation.
    - Special revelation is given in various ways, culminating in **Scripture**.
    - The Scriptures are the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of faith.
    - Without special revelation, the way of salvation cannot be known.
    - "Therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal Himself, and to declare that His will unto His Church." (WCF 1.1)

3. **Scripture as the Norm of Special Revelation**
    - The **Holy Scriptures** are the final and complete form of special revelation.
    - All former ways of God’s revealing His will have ceased.
    - The Scriptures are necessary because of the corruption of man and the malice of Satan.
    - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture are emphasized for faith and life.
    - "Those former ways of God's revealing his will unto his people being now ceased." (WCF 1.1)

4. **The Light of Nature and Its Limits**
    - The **light of nature** enables some knowledge of God and moral duty.
    - It is insufficient for a saving knowledge of God.
    - The light of nature is affirmed but always subordinated to Scripture.
    - It provides a basis for natural law and civil order, but not for redemption.
    - "There are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence." (WCF 1.6)

5. **Providence as a Mode of General Revelation**
    - God’s ongoing governance of the world reveals His attributes.
    - Providence testifies to God’s **sovereignty** and **faithfulness**.
    - This revelation is accessible to all, but does not regenerate or save.
    - Providence, like creation, points to God but cannot bring about saving faith.
    - "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork." (WCF 21.1, citing Psalm 19:1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on the distinction between **general and special revelation**, emphasizing the necessity and sufficiency of Scripture for salvation. Their articulation of these categories has influenced confessional documents, catechetical instruction, and theological education across Presbyterian and Reformed traditions. The clear delineation between what can be known of God through nature and what must be revealed through Scripture remains a foundational principle in Reformed epistemology and apologetics.
