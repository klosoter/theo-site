# Michael Kruger (1973– )

Michael Kruger is a leading contemporary scholar on the **canon of Scripture**, emphasizing its intrinsic authority and self-authenticating nature within the early church. He argues that **canon** is not merely a product of **ecclesiastical tradition** but is rooted in the divine qualities of the biblical texts themselves, recognized by the church through the guidance of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "The church did not create the canon, but rather recognized the books that God had inspired." (Canon Revisited)

## Key Works

- Canon Revisited: Establishing the Origins and Authority of the New Testament Books
- The Question of Canon: Challenging the Status Quo in the New Testament Debate
- The Heresy of Orthodoxy (with Andreas Köstenberger)
- The Early Text of the New Testament (co-edited with Charles E. Hill)
- Christianity at the Crossroads: How the Second Century Shaped the Future of the Church

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canon is Self-Authenticating**
    - The authority of the canon derives from its divine qualities, not external validation.
    - The church recognizes, rather than determines, which books are canonical.
    - The self-authenticating model relies on the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit.
    - Canonical books bear marks of **divine inspiration** and unity.
    - "The canon is not an authoritative list of books, but a list of authoritative books." (Canon Revisited)

2. **Rejection of the Community-Determined Model**
    - The canon is not established by majority consensus or ecclesiastical decree.
    - Early Christian communities did not invent the canon but responded to the authority of Scripture.
    - The church’s role is receptive, not creative, regarding canon formation.
    - Tradition is important but subordinate to the authority of Scripture itself.
    - "The church is the receiver and custodian of the canon, not its mother." (Canon Revisited)

3. **Recognition of Canonical Books is Providential**
    - The process of canon recognition is guided by **God’s providence**.
    - Historical developments are seen as means by which God led the church to recognize the canon.
    - The recognition process was organic and gradual, not arbitrary or purely political.
    - The providential model affirms both divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
    - "God’s providence ensured that the right books were recognized as Scripture." (The Question of Canon)

4. **Scripture and Tradition are Distinct but Related**
    - Tradition serves as a witness to the canon but does not possess equal authority.
    - The **regula fidei** (rule of faith) reflects the church’s reception of apostolic teaching.
    - Tradition helps identify canonical books but is always subject to Scripture.
    - The authority of the canon is intrinsic, while tradition is derivative.
    - "Tradition is valuable as a historical witness, but it is not the foundation of the canon." (Canon Revisited)

5. **Apostolicity as a Criterion for Canon**
    - Canonical books are either written by apostles or closely associated with apostolic authority.
    - Apostolicity ensures continuity with the foundational witness of the early church.
    - This criterion distinguishes canonical texts from later, non-apostolic writings.
    - Apostolic origin is recognized through historical investigation and church testimony.
    - "Apostolicity was a key factor in the early church’s recognition of canonical books." (The Question of Canon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kruger’s scholarship has significantly shaped modern evangelical understanding of the **canon of Scripture**, challenging critical models that subordinate canon to tradition or ecclesiastical authority. His articulation of the self-authenticating model has provided a robust theological and historical framework for defending the integrity and authority of the New Testament canon. Kruger’s work continues to influence both academic and ecclesial discussions on the relationship between **canon and tradition**, reinforcing the primacy of Scripture within the Reformed tradition.
