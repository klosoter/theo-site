# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached the question of **canon and tradition** from the standpoint of **Reformed biblical theology**, emphasizing the organic development of **revelation** and the unique authority of **Scripture**. He maintained that the **canon** is self-authenticating and arises from the unfolding of **redemptive history**, while **tradition** must always be subordinate to the finality of the biblical text.

- "The Scriptures are not a product of the church, but the church is a product of the Scriptures." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "The Doctrine of Revelation in the History of Dogma" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)
- "The Self-Testimony of Jesus to the Scriptures" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canon as the Product of Revelation**
   - The **canon** is the result of God's progressive **self-revelation** in history.
   - The process of canonization reflects the organic unity of **redemptive history**.
   - The authority of the canon is inherent, not conferred by the church.
   - The canon is closed with the completion of **apostolic revelation**.
   - "The canon is not a collection of writings arbitrarily selected, but the necessary outcome of the process of revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

2. **Scripture’s Self-Attestation**
   - **Scripture** bears witness to its own divine origin and authority.
   - The **Holy Spirit** confirms the canonical status of Scripture to the believer.
   - The church recognizes, but does not create, the canon.
   - The self-authenticating nature of Scripture stands over all tradition.
   - "The testimony of the Holy Spirit is the highest ground for the acceptance of the canon." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

3. **Tradition’s Subordinate Role**
   - **Tradition** is valuable but always subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
   - The church’s creeds and confessions serve as guides, not sources of revelation.
   - Tradition must be continually tested by the norm of the biblical canon.
   - Vos warns against elevating tradition to a level of parity with Scripture.
   - "Tradition is not a second source of revelation, but a witness to the revelation already given." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

4. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
   - Revelation unfolds organically, culminating in Christ and the apostolic witness.
   - The canon reflects the unity and progression of **God’s redemptive acts**.
   - The Old and New Testaments form a single, coherent canon.
   - The process of canonization mirrors the historical development of revelation.
   - "The unity of the canon is grounded in the unity of the redemptive revelation." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Historical Development of the Canon**
   - Vos emphasizes the historical process by which the canon was recognized.
   - The church’s recognition of the canon is part of God’s providential guidance.
   - The closing of the canon corresponds to the cessation of special revelation.
   - The history of canon formation is inseparable from the history of redemption.
   - "The history of the canon is the history of the church’s recognition of God’s completed revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s approach to **canon and tradition** has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, reinforcing the primacy of **Scripture** and the organic unity of **redemptive history**. His insistence on the self-authenticating nature of the canon and the subordinate role of tradition continues to influence confessional Reformed thought. Vos’s work remains foundational for those seeking to articulate a robust doctrine of Scripture that is both historically grounded and theologically rich.
