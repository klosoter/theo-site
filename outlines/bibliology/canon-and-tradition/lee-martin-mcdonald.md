# Lee Martin McDonald (1944–)

Lee Martin McDonald is a leading scholar on the development of the **biblical canon** and its relationship to **Christian tradition**. He emphasizes the complex historical process by which the **Old and New Testament canons** were recognized, highlighting the role of **church tradition**, **community reception**, and the **Spirit’s guidance** rather than a simple, fixed list from the earliest days of the church.

- "The canon was not dropped from heaven but emerged from the life and faith of the early church." (The Biblical Canon: Its Origin, Transmission, and Authority)

## Key Works

- The Biblical Canon: Its Origin, Transmission, and Authority
- The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon
- The Origin of the Bible (co-edited with James A. Sanders)
- The Canon Debate (co-edited with James A. Sanders)
- Formation of the Bible: The Story of the Church’s Canon

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canon as a Historical Process**
    - The **canon** developed over centuries, not instantaneously.
    - Early Christian communities used a variety of texts before consensus emerged.
    - The process involved debate, discernment, and gradual acceptance.
    - The **Holy Spirit** is seen as guiding, but not dictating, the process.
    - "The canonization of Scripture was a long and complex process involving both divine guidance and human agency." (The Biblical Canon)

2. **Role of Tradition in Canon Formation**
    - **Church tradition** played a significant role in recognizing authoritative texts.
    - Early lists and usage in worship influenced which books were accepted.
    - Tradition helped preserve and transmit the texts.
    - The boundaries of the canon were shaped by communal practice.
    - "Tradition was the matrix in which the canon was formed and recognized." (The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon)

3. **Community Reception as Canonical Criterion**
    - Widespread and continuous use by the **Christian community** was crucial.
    - Books accepted across diverse regions gained canonical status.
    - Reception was as important as apostolic origin or inspiration.
    - Disputed books often reflected lack of consensus in reception.
    - "The authority of the canon was recognized in the life and worship of the community." (The Canon Debate)

4. **Distinction Between Scripture and Canon**
    - Not all **Scripture** was immediately considered **canonical**.
    - Some texts were revered but not included in the final canon.
    - The concept of canon implies a closed, authoritative list.
    - The distinction clarifies debates over apocryphal and deuterocanonical books.
    - "Scripture existed before there was a canon; not all Scripture became canon." (The Biblical Canon)

5. **Ongoing Authority and Function of Canon**
    - The **canon** serves as the normative rule for faith and practice.
    - Its authority is rooted in both divine inspiration and ecclesial recognition.
    - The canon continues to shape Christian identity and doctrine.
    - The church’s recognition of the canon is an act of faith in the Spirit’s leading.
    - "The canon remains the church’s standard for faith, life, and doctrine." (Formation of the Bible)

## Legacy and Impact

McDonald’s scholarship has reshaped modern understanding of the **formation of the biblical canon**, emphasizing the interplay between **tradition**, community, and divine providence. His work challenges simplistic or purely mechanical views of canonization, urging a nuanced appreciation of historical and theological dynamics. McDonald’s influence is evident in contemporary debates on **Scripture, authority, and tradition**, making his contributions essential for students of biblical and systematic theology.
