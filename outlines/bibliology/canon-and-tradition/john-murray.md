# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray upheld the **unique authority of Scripture** as the sole and sufficient **canon** for the church, insisting that all **doctrine** and **practice** must be normed by the **Word of God**. While he valued **tradition** as a witness to biblical truth, he maintained that it is always subordinate and never a source of divine revelation.

- "The only infallible rule of faith and practice is the Word of God written." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- The Authority of Scripture (in Collected Writings, Vol. 1)
- Principles of Conduct
- Redemption Accomplished and Applied
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT Commentary)
- "The Attestation of Scripture" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1942)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole Canon**
    - Scripture alone is the **norma normans** for faith and life.
    - The canon is closed and uniquely inspired by the Holy Spirit.
    - No tradition, creed, or council stands on par with Scripture’s authority.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture excludes any supplementary revelatory authority.
    "The canon of Scripture is complete, and nothing is to be added to it as a source of revelation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

2. **Tradition as Ministerial, Not Magisterial**
    - Tradition serves to witness to and preserve the truth of Scripture.
    - The church’s confessions and creeds are valuable but always subordinate.
    - Historical theology aids understanding but does not bind the conscience.
    - Tradition must be continually tested by the Word of God.
    "Tradition has no intrinsic authority apart from its conformity to Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

3. **Organic Inspiration and Preservation**
    - The Holy Spirit superintended the writing and preservation of Scripture.
    - The canon reflects God’s providential guidance in history.
    - The church recognizes, but does not determine, the canon.
    - The authority of Scripture is not derived from ecclesiastical approval.
    "The church is the custodian, not the creator, of the canon." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

4. **Rejection of Ongoing Revelation**
    - No new revelation is given beyond the apostolic witness.
    - Claims to new, binding revelation undermine the sufficiency of Scripture.
    - The canon is normatively closed with the apostolic era.
    - The Spirit’s illumination is distinct from new revelation.
    "There is no further revelation to be expected beyond what God has given in Scripture." (Principles of Conduct)

5. **Confessional Use of Tradition**
    - Confessions summarize and clarify biblical teaching for the church.
    - They serve as aids in teaching, discipline, and unity.
    - Confessions are always subject to correction by Scripture.
    - The **Reformed tradition** values confessions as secondary standards.
    "Our confessions are valuable only insofar as they echo the teaching of Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust defense of the **supremacy of Scripture** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. His careful articulation of the relationship between canon and tradition reinforced the distinctives of **sola Scriptura** while appreciating the church’s historical witness. Murray’s work continues to inform debates on biblical authority and the proper role of tradition in Reformed theology.
