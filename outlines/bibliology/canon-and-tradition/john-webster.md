# John Webster (1955–2016)

John Webster approached the question of **canon and tradition** by grounding both in the self-communicative activity of the **triune God**. He emphasized that **Holy Scripture** is the divinely appointed means by which the church receives revelation, while **tradition** is the Spirit-guided transmission and interpretation of that revelation within the life of the church.

- "Holy Scripture is the creaturely means by which the presence and activity of the triune God is mediated to the church." (Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canon as Divine Gift**
    - The canon is not merely a historical product but a gracious act of **divine self-communication**.
    - Scripture’s authority is rooted in its origin from the **triune God**, not in ecclesial recognition alone.
    - The canon is the normative witness to **God’s revelation** in Jesus Christ.
    - The church receives, rather than creates, the canon through the Spirit’s leading.
    - "The canon is not a product of the church’s will, but a gift which the church receives and to which it submits." (Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch)

2. **Tradition as Ecclesial Reception**
    - **Tradition** is the church’s ongoing, Spirit-enabled response to the canonical Scriptures.
    - It is not a second source of revelation but the faithful transmission of the apostolic witness.
    - Tradition serves to guide interpretation but remains subordinate to Scripture.
    - The church’s confessions and practices are measured by their fidelity to the canonical norm.
    - "Tradition is the living process by which the church is brought under the authority of the gospel." (Word and Church)

3. **Scripture’s Sufficiency and Clarity**
    - **Holy Scripture** is sufficient for faith and practice, containing all things necessary for salvation.
    - The clarity of Scripture is grounded in its divine origin and the Spirit’s illuminating work.
    - Tradition aids understanding but does not supplement or complete Scripture.
    - The church’s interpretive task is to listen attentively to the canonical text.
    - "Scripture is clear, not because it is simple, but because God makes himself known through it." (Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch)

4. **The Role of the Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the agent who both inspires Scripture and guides its interpretation in the church.
    - The Spirit unites canon and tradition by ensuring the church’s ongoing faithfulness to the apostolic witness.
    - Without the Spirit, both canon and tradition become inert and merely historical.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures that tradition remains dynamic and oriented toward Christ.
    - "The Spirit is the bond between the canonical text and the living church." (The Domain of the Word)

5. **Dogmatic Primacy of Scripture**
    - **Dogmatics** must begin with and continually return to the canonical Scriptures.
    - Tradition is valuable insofar as it serves the church’s hearing of the Word.
    - Theological reasoning is accountable to the canon as the supreme norm.
    - The church’s unity and identity are shaped by its submission to Scripture.
    - "Dogmatics is an exercise in listening to the canon as the voice of the living God." (Confessing God)

## Legacy and Impact

Webster’s theology of **canon and tradition** has significantly shaped contemporary Protestant dogmatics, especially in emphasizing the primacy of **Holy Scripture** within the life of the church. His insistence on the Spirit’s role in both the formation and reception of the canon has influenced debates on biblical authority and ecclesial identity. Webster’s work continues to challenge theologians to hold together the authority of Scripture and the necessity of tradition, always under the lordship of the triune God.
