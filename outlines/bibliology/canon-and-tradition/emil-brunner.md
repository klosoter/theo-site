# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the question of **canon and tradition** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the primacy of the **Word of God** over both ecclesiastical tradition and the written canon. He argued that **Scripture** is authoritative because it is the unique witness to the divine self-revelation in Christ, but he was wary of equating the authority of the canon with the authority of the living Word. For Brunner, **tradition** has a subordinate role, serving only as a witness to the revelation actualized by the Holy Spirit.

- "The authority of the Bible rests upon the fact that it is the witness of the Word of God, not upon the fact that it is a book of divine origin." (Revelation and Reason)

## Key Works

- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Dogmatics, Vol. I: The Christian Doctrine of God
- Truth as Encounter
- The Mediator

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Word of God over Canon**
    - The **Word of God** is a dynamic event, not merely a static text.
    - The Bible is authoritative as the witness to the Word, not as an object of veneration itself.
    - The **canon** is important but derives its authority from its function as a medium of encounter with Christ.
    - The living Christ, not the letter, is the ultimate authority.
    - "The Word of God is not bound to the letter of Scripture, but is free and sovereign." (Revelation and Reason)

2. **Tradition as Witness, Not Source**
    - **Tradition** serves to point to the revelation in Christ, but cannot be a source of revelation itself.
    - The church’s tradition is valuable only insofar as it testifies to the original apostolic witness.
    - Brunner rejects the Roman Catholic view of tradition as a parallel source of authority.
    - Tradition must always be critiqued by the living Word.
    - "Tradition is not revelation, but only the memory of revelation." (Dogmatics I)

3. **Revelation as Personal Encounter**
    - Revelation is fundamentally an encounter between God and the human person.
    - The **Holy Spirit** actualizes the Word in the present, making the canon effective.
    - The authority of Scripture is realized in the event of faith, not in the text alone.
    - The canon is a means to the end of personal encounter with God.
    - "Revelation is always an event, never a possession." (Truth as Encounter)

4. **Critical Role of the Church**
    - The church is the community that preserves and proclaims the canonical witness.
    - The church’s authority is derivative, not original; it is subject to the Word.
    - The process of canonization was a recognition of the apostolic witness, not a conferral of authority.
    - The church must continually return to the canon for correction and renewal.
    - "The Church is the servant of the Word, not its master." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Rejection of Biblicism and Traditionalism**
    - Brunner opposes both the literalist elevation of the canon (biblicism) and the uncritical acceptance of tradition (traditionalism).
    - He insists on the necessity of **faith** and the work of the Spirit for true understanding.
    - The authority of the canon is not mechanical or automatic.
    - Both Scripture and tradition must be interpreted in light of the living Christ.
    - "The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life." (Revelation and Reason)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **canon and tradition** significantly shaped 20th-century Protestant theology, especially in the context of **dialectical theology**. His insistence on the primacy of the **Word of God** as event, rather than as static text or tradition, challenged both Protestant biblicism and Catholic traditionalism. Brunner’s thought continues to influence discussions on the relationship between **Scripture, tradition, and revelation**, particularly in ecumenical dialogues and debates over the nature of authority in the church.
