# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the relationship between **canon** and **tradition** with a Reformed emphasis on the unique authority of **Scripture** as the norm for faith and life, while recognizing the historical role of **tradition** in the church’s reception and recognition of the biblical canon. He was critical of any elevation of tradition to a position of parity with Scripture, yet he acknowledged the church’s historical witness as significant in the process of **canonicity**. Berkouwer’s nuanced perspective sought to avoid both **traditionalism** and **individualism** in understanding the formation and function of the canon.

- "The canon is not the product of the church, but the church is the product of the canon." (Holy Scripture, p. 211)

- Studies in Dogmatics: Holy Scripture
- The Second Vatican Council and the New Catholicism
- The Work of Christ
- General Revelation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Normative Authority**
    - Scripture alone is the final and binding authority for faith and doctrine.
    - The canon is not subject to the church’s authority but stands over the church.
    - Tradition must be evaluated in light of Scripture, not vice versa.
    - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture are foundational for the church’s life.
    - "Scripture is not a part of tradition, but the norm of tradition." (Holy Scripture, p. 212)

2. **Tradition’s Ministerial Role**
    - Tradition serves as a historical witness to the reception of the canon.
    - The church’s recognition of the canon is a response to the self-authenticating nature of Scripture.
    - Tradition is valuable but not infallible or normative.
    - The church’s confessions and creeds are subordinate to Scripture.
    - "Tradition is not a second source of revelation, but a testimony to the Word already given." (Holy Scripture, p. 214)

3. **Rejection of Dual Source Theory**
    - Berkouwer rejects the Roman Catholic view of tradition as a second, independent source of revelation.
    - He critiques any attempt to place tradition alongside Scripture as equally authoritative.
    - The unity of revelation is preserved by maintaining Scripture’s unique status.
    - The canon is closed; no new revelation is mediated through tradition.
    - "The idea of a twofold source of revelation is foreign to the Reformed confession." (The Second Vatican Council and the New Catholicism, p. 85)

4. **Recognition, Not Creation, of Canon**
    - The church does not create the canon but recognizes what is already authoritative.
    - The process of canonization is historical but guided by the Spirit’s witness.
    - The authority of the canon is intrinsic, not conferred by ecclesiastical decision.
    - The church’s role is receptive and confirmatory, not constitutive.
    - "The church’s recognition is not constitutive, but receptive of the canon’s authority." (Holy Scripture, p. 217)

5. **Guarding Against Traditionalism and Individualism**
    - Berkouwer warns against both uncritical acceptance of tradition and radical individualism.
    - He advocates for a communal, Spirit-led discernment of Scripture’s authority.
    - The church’s historical witness is important but must be continually reformed by the Word.
    - The canon functions to correct both ecclesiastical excess and private interpretation.
    - "The Reformation was not a rejection of tradition, but a call to return to the norm of Scripture." (Holy Scripture, p. 219)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s careful articulation of the relationship between **canon** and **tradition** has shaped modern Reformed theology’s approach to **Scripture’s authority** and the church’s historical witness. His work provided a robust critique of both Roman Catholic and Protestant extremes, influencing ecumenical dialogues and evangelical thought. By emphasizing the church’s receptive posture toward the canon, Berkouwer helped clarify the ongoing significance of tradition without compromising the primacy of Scripture. His legacy endures in discussions of **canonicity**, hermeneutics, and the doctrine of revelation.
