# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the question of **canon and tradition** from a distinctively **Reformed** and **redemptive-historical** perspective, emphasizing the unique and unrepeatable role of the **apostolic witness** in the formation of the **New Testament canon**. He maintains that the **canon** is self-authenticating and normatively closed with the apostolic era, while **tradition** serves a ministerial, not magisterial, function in the ongoing life of the church.

- "The canon is not the product of the church but the church is the product of the canon." (God’s Word in Servant Form, p. 103)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canon is Apostolic and Redemptive-Historical**
    - The **New Testament canon** is grounded in the unique, once-for-all **apostolic witness** to Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The closure of the canon coincides with the end of the apostolic era.
    - The canon is not an evolving collection but a completed, divinely instituted norm.
    - The church recognizes, but does not create, the canon.
    - "The canon is the product of the once-for-all, unrepeatable event of Christ and his apostles." (God’s Word in Servant Form, p. 104)

2. **Tradition is Ministerial, Not Magisterial**
    - **Tradition** serves to transmit and witness to the apostolic gospel, not to supplement or stand alongside Scripture as an independent authority.
    - The church’s creeds and confessions are subordinate to the canon.
    - Tradition is valuable for maintaining continuity but is always normed by Scripture.
    - The Reformed principle of sola Scriptura governs the church’s use of tradition.
    - "Tradition is not a second source of revelation but a servant of the apostolic Word." (God’s Word in Servant Form, p. 110)

3. **Scripture’s Self-Authenticating Authority**
    - The authority of the canon derives from its divine origin, not ecclesiastical endorsement.
    - The Holy Spirit testifies internally to the truth and authority of Scripture.
    - The church’s recognition of the canon is an act of submission, not of sovereignty.
    - The self-authenticating nature of Scripture is central to the Reformed doctrine of revelation.
    - "The church’s recognition of the canon is an act of obedience, not of authority." (God’s Word in Servant Form, p. 106)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
    - The canon must be interpreted within the unfolding drama of **redemptive history**.
    - The unity and diversity of Scripture are rooted in the progress of revelation.
    - Apostolic teaching is normative because it is the divinely authorized interpretation of Christ’s work.
    - The redemptive-historical method guards against both traditionalism and subjectivism.
    - "The canon is the norm because it is the Spirit-given witness to the once-for-all accomplishment of redemption." (Inerrancy and Hermeneutic, p. 52)

5. **Cessation of Revelation**
    - With the completion of the apostolic witness, special revelation has ceased.
    - No new normative revelation is given beyond the canonical Scriptures.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture is tied to the finality of the canon.
    - The church’s ongoing task is to interpret and apply, not to add to, the apostolic Word.
    - "The closure of the canon marks the end of revelatory activity in the history of redemption." (Perspectives on Pentecost, p. 99)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** on the relationship between **canon and tradition**, especially in the context of debates over sola Scriptura and the authority of church tradition. His redemptive-historical approach has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, reinforcing the unique, normative role of the apostolic canon. Gaffin’s insistence on the ministerial role of tradition and the self-authenticating nature of Scripture continues to inform discussions on biblical authority and the church’s confessional identity.
