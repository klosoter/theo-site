# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **canon and tradition** is foundational for Western Christianity. He upheld the **authority of the canonical Scriptures** as the supreme rule of faith, while also recognizing the formative role of **ecclesial tradition** in discerning and transmitting the canon. Augustine’s approach balances the primacy of **Scripture** with the necessity of the **Church’s witness** in identifying and interpreting the biblical canon.

- "I would not believe the Gospel unless moved by the authority of the Catholic Church." (Against the Epistle of Manichaeus Called Fundamental, 5.6)

## Key Works

- On Christian Doctrine (De Doctrina Christiana)
- The City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- Confessions (Confessiones)
- Letter to Jerome (Epistula 82)
- Against the Epistle of Manichaeus Called Fundamental

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Supreme Authority**
    - The **canonical Scriptures** are the ultimate standard for Christian faith and practice.
    - All doctrinal disputes must be resolved by appeal to the **Scriptures**.
    - The authority of Scripture is above that of any individual teacher or council.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are affirmed, though interpretation requires guidance.
    - "For among the things that are plainly laid down in Scripture are to be found all matters that concern faith and the manner of life." (On Christian Doctrine, 2.9)

2. **Role of the Church in Recognizing the Canon**
    - The **Church** serves as the historical witness to the authenticity and boundaries of the canon.
    - The process of canon recognition is guided by the Holy Spirit through the Church.
    - The authority of the canon is not derived from the Church, but its recognition is mediated by the Church’s testimony.
    - The consensus of the **Catholic Church** is decisive in distinguishing canonical from non-canonical books.
    - "I would not believe the Gospel unless moved by the authority of the Catholic Church." (Against the Epistle of Manichaeus Called Fundamental, 5.6)

3. **Tradition as Interpretive Guide**
    - **Tradition** provides a hermeneutical framework for understanding Scripture.
    - The teachings of the **Church Fathers** and councils help safeguard orthodox interpretation.
    - Tradition is subordinate to Scripture but necessary for faithful exegesis.
    - The regula fidei (rule of faith) summarizes the core content of apostolic tradition.
    - "Let us hold fast to the rule of faith which we have received from the Church." (On the Trinity, 4.6.10)

4. **Distinction Between Canonical and Ecclesiastical Writings**
    - Only the **canonical Scriptures** possess binding authority for all Christians.
    - Writings of the **Fathers** and councils are respected but not infallible.
    - Ecclesiastical writings are to be tested by the standard of Scripture.
    - Augustine distinguishes between inspired Scripture and other church writings.
    - "For the canonical Scriptures are set apart from all other writings with a peculiar dignity." (Reply to Faustus the Manichaean, 11.5)

5. **Unity of Scripture and Tradition in the Life of the Church**
    - **Scripture** and **tradition** are not opposed but work together in the Church’s life.
    - The liturgy and creeds embody the Church’s reception of both Scripture and tradition.
    - The faithful transmission of the canon depends on the living tradition of the Church.
    - The unity of the Church is maintained through adherence to both Scripture and apostolic tradition.
    - "The Church maintains and hands down what she has received from the apostles." (On Baptism, Against the Donatists, 4.24.31)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s synthesis of **canon and tradition** profoundly shaped both medieval and Reformation theology. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture**—received and recognized within the Church—became a touchstone for later debates on authority. Augustine’s nuanced view of tradition as interpretive and ecclesial, yet subordinate to Scripture, influenced both Roman Catholic and Protestant approaches to the doctrine of Scripture. His legacy endures in ongoing discussions of the relationship between **biblical canon**, church authority, and the transmission of Christian truth.
