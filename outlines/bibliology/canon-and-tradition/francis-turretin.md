# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin was a leading voice in the **Reformed Orthodox** tradition, articulating a robust doctrine of **Scripture** and its relation to **tradition**. He maintained that the **canon** of Scripture is self-authenticating and that **tradition** serves a ministerial, not magisterial, role, always subordinate to the **sufficiency** and **authority** of the biblical text.

- "The Scriptures alone are the rule of faith; tradition is not a part of the rule, but only a witness and handmaid to it." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- The Doctrine of Scripture (sections within Institutes)
- The Necessity of the Holy Scriptures (Disputationes Theologicae)
- Francis Turretin and the Reformed Tradition (ed. R. Muller, secondary)
- Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (R. Muller, secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Canon is Self-Authenticating**
    - The **canon** is recognized by the church, not constituted by it.
    - The marks of canonicity are intrinsic to the biblical books.
    - The Holy Spirit testifies to the authority of Scripture in the hearts of believers.
    - The church’s role is to discern, not determine, the canon.
    - "The authority of the canonical books does not depend upon the church, but upon God alone." (Institutes)

2. **Tradition is Ministerial, Not Magisterial**
    - **Tradition** serves to witness to and preserve the Scriptures.
    - It is subordinate and never equal to the authority of Scripture.
    - Traditions must be tested by the Word of God.
    - The Reformed reject unwritten traditions as binding for faith.
    - "Tradition is not a rule of faith, but a witness to the rule." (Institutes)

3. **Scripture is Sufficient and Perspicuous**
    - The **sufficiency** of Scripture means all things necessary for salvation are contained within.
    - The **perspicuity** of Scripture ensures its main teachings are clear.
    - Human traditions cannot supplement or complete Scripture.
    - The clarity of Scripture is for the essentials, not every detail.
    - "Nothing necessary to salvation is lacking in Scripture." (Institutes)

4. **Distinction Between Divine and Ecclesiastical Tradition**
    - Divine tradition refers to the apostolic teaching now inscripturated.
    - Ecclesiastical traditions are human customs and practices.
    - Only divine tradition, now written, is binding for faith.
    - Ecclesiastical traditions are permissible if they do not contradict Scripture.
    - "We distinguish between apostolic tradition, now written, and ecclesiastical traditions, which are mutable." (Institutes)

5. **Rejection of the Apocrypha as Canonical**
    - The **Apocryphal** books lack the marks of canonicity.
    - They were not received by the Jewish church or Christ and the apostles.
    - Their doctrine is inconsistent with canonical Scripture.
    - The church’s use of the Apocrypha is as historical, not authoritative, texts.
    - "The Apocryphal books are not of equal authority with the canonical Scriptures." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of the relationship between **canon** and **tradition** became foundational for later Reformed confessions and systematic theologies. His insistence on the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the subordinate role of tradition shaped Protestant polemics against Roman Catholic claims. Turretin’s careful distinctions continue to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of biblical authority and the function of tradition within the church. His influence endures in both academic theology and confessional Reformed practice.
