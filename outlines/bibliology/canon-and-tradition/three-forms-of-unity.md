# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate the classic **Reformed doctrine of Scripture**, emphasizing the **sufficiency**, **clarity**, and **authority** of the biblical canon over all human tradition. These confessional standards consistently subordinate all ecclesiastical tradition to the **Word of God** as the final and only infallible rule of faith and practice.

- "We believe that those Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 3–7
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 19, 21, 65–68
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially the Rejection of Errors
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard collected editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Only Norming Norm**
   - The **Holy Scriptures** are the sole, infallible rule for faith and life.
   - All church tradition, councils, and writings are subordinate to the Bible.
   - The canon is closed; no new revelation is to be added.
   - The church recognizes, but does not create, the canon.
   "We receive all these books, and these only, as holy and canonical, for the regulation, foundation, and confirmation of our faith." (Belgic Confession, Art. 5)

2. **Sufficiency and Perspicuity of Scripture**
   - Scripture contains everything necessary for **salvation** and Christian living.
   - The essential teachings of Scripture are clear to all believers.
   - Human traditions are rejected if they obscure or add to the gospel.
   - The church’s authority is ministerial, not magisterial, regarding doctrine.
   "Neither may we consider any writings of men, however holy these men may have been, of equal value with those divine Scriptures." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

3. **Authority of Scripture over Tradition**
   - The **Word of God** stands above all ecclesiastical pronouncements.
   - Councils and confessions are subject to correction by Scripture.
   - The church's teaching office is bound to the text of Scripture.
   - Tradition is valued but never equal to or above Scripture.
   "Therefore we reject with all our hearts whatsoever doth not agree with this infallible rule." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

4. **Recognition of the Canon**
   - The church discerns, but does not determine, the canon of Scripture.
   - The canonical books are self-authenticating and recognized by their internal qualities.
   - Apocryphal writings are excluded from the canon and not authoritative for doctrine.
   - The list of canonical books is explicitly affirmed in the confessions.
   "They are received by us for the regulation, foundation, and confirmation of our faith." (Belgic Confession, Art. 6)

5. **Scripture as the Means of Grace**
   - The **Holy Spirit** works through Scripture to create and sustain faith.
   - The sacraments are effectual only as they are joined to the Word.
   - Preaching is the primary means by which God communicates grace.
   - The church is called to faithfully proclaim and teach the Scriptures.
   "Faith is worked in our hearts by the Holy Spirit through the preaching of the holy gospel." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 65)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have shaped the **Reformed tradition’s** understanding of the **doctrine of Scripture**, establishing a confessional standard for the authority, sufficiency, and clarity of the Bible. Their influence endures in Reformed churches worldwide, providing a robust theological foundation for the church’s teaching and practice. By clearly subordinating tradition to Scripture, these confessions have safeguarded the principle of **sola Scriptura** and continue to inform contemporary debates on biblical authority.
