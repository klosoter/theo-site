# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin maintained that **Scripture alone** is the supreme authority for the church, sharply distinguishing the **canon** of inspired writings from later **tradition**. While he acknowledged the historical value of church tradition, Calvin insisted that all doctrines and practices must be tested by the **Word of God**, rejecting any claim that tradition could stand alongside or above the **biblical canon**.

- "The Word of God is the foundation of all right knowledge; and the only way to preserve the purity of doctrine is to reject everything that does not come from it." (Institutes of the Christian Religion)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 6–10)
- Commentaries on the Canonical Scriptures
- Treatises Against the Nicodemites
- Reply to Cardinal Sadoleto
- Selected Letters (esp. correspondence on church order and authority)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole Rule of Faith**
    - The **canon** of Scripture is self-authenticating and sufficient for salvation and doctrine.
    - All church teachings must be derived from or consistent with the **biblical text**.
    - Human traditions are subordinate and must be judged by Scripture.
    - The church does not create the canon but recognizes it.
    - "Scripture is the school of the Holy Spirit, in which, as nothing is omitted that is both necessary and useful to know, so nothing is taught but what is expedient to know." (Institutes I.vi.3)

2. **Distinction Between Canon and Tradition**
    - The **canon** is divinely inspired; tradition is human and fallible.
    - Tradition may preserve helpful practices but cannot bind the conscience.
    - The authority of tradition is always secondary and derivative.
    - The church fathers are valuable guides but not infallible authorities.
    - "We hold that the Word of God alone lies beyond the sphere of our judgment; fathers and councils are not to be followed except in so far as they are in agreement with the Word." (Institutes IV.ix.8)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Recognizing Canon**
    - The **Holy Spirit** testifies inwardly to the truth of Scripture.
    - The authority of the canon is not dependent on church decree.
    - Assurance of Scripture’s authority comes from the Spirit, not tradition.
    - The Spirit’s witness is necessary for true understanding and acceptance.
    - "The testimony of the Spirit is more excellent than all reason." (Institutes I.vii.4)

4. **Critical Use of Church Tradition**
    - Tradition is valuable for historical continuity and interpretation.
    - Early creeds and councils are respected when they align with Scripture.
    - Tradition can clarify but never override the **biblical canon**.
    - Calvin frequently cites the fathers to demonstrate the antiquity of Reformed positions.
    - "We do not despise the fathers, but we do not regard anything as certain unless it is confirmed by Scripture." (Institutes IV.viii.13)

5. **Rejection of Unscriptural Innovations**
    - Practices and doctrines lacking biblical warrant are to be rejected.
    - The church must continually reform itself according to the Word.
    - Human inventions in worship or doctrine are sources of error.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture guards against the corruption of tradition.
    - "God wills that we should not be wise above what is written." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians 4:6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s rigorous distinction between **canon and tradition** shaped the **Reformed doctrine of sola Scriptura**, influencing confessions and church practice across Protestantism. His insistence on the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture provided a bulwark against the elevation of ecclesiastical tradition to a normative status. Calvin’s approach continues to inform debates on biblical authority, the role of tradition, and the nature of church reform. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to the primacy of the **Word of God** in Reformed theology.
