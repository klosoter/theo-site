# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the question of **canon and tradition** through his method of **correlation**, emphasizing the dynamic relationship between the **Christian message** and the **existential questions** of culture. He viewed the **biblical canon** not as a static deposit but as a living witness to the **New Being** in Christ, mediated through the ongoing tradition of the church and interpreted in light of contemporary human experience.

- "The Protestant principle forbids the identification of any finite reality with the divine and calls for a continuous criticism of all religious traditions, including the biblical canon." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- The Protestant Era
- Theology of Culture
- Dynamics of Faith
- Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canon as Dynamic Witness**
    - The **biblical canon** is a historical document that testifies to the **revelation** of the **New Being** in Christ.
    - Canonical authority is not absolute but is mediated through its existential relevance.
    - The canon must be interpreted in the context of the present situation and human predicament.
    - The authority of Scripture is derivative from its power to convey the message of salvation.
    - "The Bible has authority because it is the original document in which the Christian answer is given in the most complete and creative way." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Tradition as Living Interpretation**
    - **Tradition** is the ongoing process by which the church interprets and reinterprets the biblical message.
    - Tradition is necessary for the transmission of faith but must remain open to critique.
    - The Protestant principle demands that tradition never be absolutized.
    - Tradition serves as a medium for correlating the eternal message with temporal situations.
    - "Tradition is the continuous interpretation of the message in changing situations." (The Protestant Era)

3. **The Protestant Principle**
    - The **Protestant principle** insists on the ultimate authority of the **divine** over all human expressions, including canon and tradition.
    - It calls for the perpetual critique of all religious forms to avoid idolatry.
    - No human institution or text can be equated with the divine self-disclosure.
    - This principle undergirds Tillich’s approach to both canon and tradition.
    - "The Protestant principle is the constant warning against the idolatry of the letter." (The Protestant Era)

4. **Correlation of Message and Situation**
    - Theology must correlate the **Christian message** with the existential questions of each era.
    - The canon and tradition are resources for this correlation, not final answers in themselves.
    - The meaning of revelation is actualized in the encounter between message and contemporary context.
    - This method allows for a dynamic and living theology.
    - "The method of correlation explains the contents of the Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Revelation Beyond the Letter**
    - **Revelation** is not confined to the text but is mediated through the **Spirit** in history and culture.
    - The canon is a privileged witness but not the exclusive locus of revelation.
    - Tradition and culture can also become vehicles for the divine message.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures that revelation remains living and relevant.
    - "Revelation is the manifestation of the ground of being for human experience; it is not limited to the words of Scripture." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **canon and tradition** has profoundly shaped modern **systematic theology**, especially in its openness to culture and existential questions. His **method of correlation** provided a framework for engaging contemporary issues while remaining rooted in the Christian message. Tillich’s emphasis on the **Protestant principle** continues to challenge both Protestant and Catholic theologians to avoid absolutizing any human expression of the divine. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the authority of Scripture and the role of tradition in theological reflection.
