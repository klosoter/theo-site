# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches the topic of **canon and tradition** from a robustly **Reformed** and **presuppositional** perspective, emphasizing the **self-authenticating authority of Scripture** and the necessity of **Sola Scriptura**. He maintains that the **biblical canon** is established by God’s providence and recognized through the internal testimony of the **Holy Spirit**, while tradition is valuable only insofar as it submits to and serves the **Scriptures**.

- "The canon is not arbitrary, but is the result of God’s own self-attesting word and the work of the Holy Spirit in the church." (Inerrancy and Worldview)

## Key Works

- Inerrancy and Worldview (2012)
- The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses (1991)
- Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology (1987)
- "Canon and Biblical Authority" in The Foundation of Biblical Authority (ed. Henry, 1972)
- "Modern Spiritual Gifts as Analogous to Apostolic Gifts: Affirming Extraordinary Works of the Spirit within Cessationist Theology" (JETS, 1996)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Self-Authenticating Canon**
   - The **canon** is established by God’s own authority, not by the church or tradition.
   - The **Holy Spirit** enables believers to recognize the true canon.
   - The church’s role is receptive, not constitutive, regarding the canon.
   - The self-attesting nature of Scripture is foundational for its authority.
   - "The canon is self-attesting because it is the voice of God himself." (Inerrancy and Worldview)

2. **Tradition as Ministerial, Not Magisterial**
   - Tradition is valuable as a witness to the truth but is always subordinate to Scripture.
   - The **Reformed principle** of Sola Scriptura governs the use of tradition.
   - Tradition can help clarify and summarize biblical teaching but cannot bind the conscience.
   - Errors in tradition must be corrected by the norm of Scripture.
   - "Tradition is helpful only as it points us back to the authority of the Bible." (Symphonic Theology)

3. **Providence in the Formation of the Canon**
   - God’s providence guided the recognition and preservation of the biblical canon.
   - The historical process of canonization is not arbitrary but reflects divine sovereignty.
   - The church’s recognition of the canon is a response to God’s initiative.
   - The canon’s boundaries are not determined by human consensus but by God’s action.
   - "God’s providence ensures that his people receive the books he intends for them." (Inerrancy and Worldview)

4. **Multiperspectival Approach to Canon and Tradition**
   - Theological understanding benefits from considering multiple legitimate perspectives.
   - Canon and tradition can be viewed through normative, situational, and existential lenses.
   - Multiperspectivalism guards against reductionism and false dichotomies.
   - This approach fosters humility and deeper engagement with the complexity of canon and tradition.
   - "No single perspective exhausts the richness of God’s truth." (Symphonic Theology)

5. **Inerrancy and the Authority of Canon**
   - The inerrancy of Scripture is inseparable from its canonical status.
   - The canon is the locus of God’s inerrant revelation to his people.
   - Inerrancy undergirds the church’s confidence in the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture.
   - Challenges to inerrancy often stem from misunderstandings of canon and tradition.
   - "Inerrancy is not an add-on to canon, but integral to its very nature as God’s word." (Inerrancy and Worldview)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed discussions** on the relationship between **canon and tradition**, especially through his emphasis on the self-authenticating nature of Scripture and the ministerial role of tradition. His **multiperspectivalism** has encouraged theologians to approach complex issues with greater nuance and humility. By grounding the authority of the canon in God’s providence and revelation, Poythress has reinforced the centrality of Scripture for evangelical theology and church life.
