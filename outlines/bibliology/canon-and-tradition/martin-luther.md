# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther asserted the **supremacy of Scripture** over all **church tradition**, insisting that the **canon** is self-authenticating and the only infallible rule of faith. He challenged the authority of ecclesiastical tradition, arguing that it must be judged by the **Word of God** and not placed on equal footing with it.

- "The true rule is this: God's Word shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel." (Smalcald Articles)

## Key Works

- 95 Theses (1517)
- Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation (1520)
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- Prefaces to the New Testament (1522, 1546)
- The Smalcald Articles (1537)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture Alone as Final Authority**
    - Scripture is the only infallible norm for doctrine and life.
    - All church tradition is subordinate to the authority of the Bible.
    - The canon is recognized by its intrinsic qualities, not by ecclesiastical decree.
    - The Holy Spirit testifies to the authority of Scripture in the hearts of believers.
    - "What is asserted without the Scriptures or proven revelation may be held as an opinion, but need not be believed." (The Babylonian Captivity of the Church)

2. **Critical Evaluation of Tradition**
    - Tradition is valuable only insofar as it agrees with Scripture.
    - Human traditions often obscure or distort the gospel.
    - Councils and popes have erred and contradicted themselves.
    - The church is reformed by returning to the Word, not by preserving tradition.
    - "Councils have often erred and contradicted themselves." (Address to the Christian Nobility)

3. **Canon Determined by Christocentricity**
    - Books that clearly proclaim **Christ** are central to the canon.
    - Luther questioned the canonicity of certain books (e.g., James, Hebrews, Revelation).
    - The gospel message is the criterion for canonicity.
    - The canon is not established by church authority but by its witness to Christ.
    - "Whatever does not teach Christ is not apostolic, even though Peter or Paul does the teaching." (Preface to the Epistles of St. James and St. Jude)

4. **Priesthood of All Believers and Access to Scripture**
    - Every Christian has the right and duty to read and interpret Scripture.
    - The church does not mediate access to the Word; Christ does.
    - Translation of the Bible into the vernacular is essential.
    - Tradition must not restrict the laity’s engagement with Scripture.
    - "A simple layman armed with Scripture is to be believed above a pope or a council without it." (Address to the Christian Nobility)

5. **Tradition as Witness, Not Rule**
    - Tradition can serve as a historical witness to the faith.
    - The creeds and confessions are useful summaries but not binding apart from Scripture.
    - The church fathers are respected but not infallible.
    - Tradition is a servant to the Word, not its master.
    - "The fathers are not to be believed against the Scriptures." (The Babylonian Captivity of the Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s doctrine of **sola Scriptura** fundamentally reshaped the relationship between **canon and tradition** in Western Christianity, setting the trajectory for all subsequent Protestant thought. His insistence on the primacy of the **Word of God** over ecclesiastical authority led to the democratization of biblical interpretation and the translation of Scripture into the vernacular. Luther’s approach continues to influence debates on the authority of tradition and the boundaries of the canon within both Protestant and ecumenical contexts.
