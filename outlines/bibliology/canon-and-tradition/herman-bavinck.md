# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck approached the question of **canon and tradition** by emphasizing the unique authority of **Scripture** as the self-authenticating Word of God, while also recognizing the legitimate, though subordinate, role of **church tradition** in the transmission and interpretation of the faith. He argued that the **canon** is not established by the church but is recognized by it, and that **tradition** serves as a witness to, rather than a source of, divine revelation.

- "The church does not create the canon, but acknowledges, maintains, and defends it." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Prolegomena
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation
- "The Catholicity of Christianity and the Church" (essay)
- Philosophy of Revelation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole Norm of Faith**
    - Scripture possesses **divine authority** independent of the church’s recognition.
    - The **canon** is self-authenticating, grounded in the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit.
    - Tradition is valuable but always subordinate to Scripture’s normativity.
    - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture are foundational for doctrine.
    - "Scripture is the only rule and norm of faith and life." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

2. **Tradition as Ministerial, Not Magisterial**
    - Tradition transmits and preserves the faith but does not add new revelation.
    - The church’s creeds and confessions are authoritative only insofar as they agree with Scripture.
    - Tradition serves as a historical witness to the interpretation of Scripture.
    - The Reformed view rejects the Roman Catholic elevation of tradition to a co-equal status with Scripture.
    - "Tradition is not a second source of revelation, but a witness to the revelation given in Scripture." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

3. **Recognition of the Canon by the Church**
    - The church recognizes, but does not establish, the canon of Scripture.
    - The process of canonization is guided by the providence of God and the Spirit’s testimony.
    - The authority of the canon is intrinsic, not conferred by ecclesiastical decision.
    - The church’s role is receptive and confirmatory, not constitutive.
    - "The canon is not an arbitrary collection but is acknowledged by the church as the Word of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

4. **Organic Development of Doctrine**
    - Doctrine develops organically within the life of the church, rooted in Scripture.
    - Tradition reflects the church’s historical engagement with the biblical text.
    - The Reformed tradition values confessions as faithful summaries, not as new revelation.
    - The Spirit leads the church into deeper understanding, not into new sources of authority.
    - "The development of doctrine is the unfolding of what is already given in Scripture." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

5. **Catholicity and Continuity of the Church**
    - The true church is catholic, united by the apostolic faith preserved in Scripture.
    - Tradition connects the contemporary church to the historic faith.
    - The unity of the church is grounded in the shared confession of the biblical canon.
    - The Reformed emphasis on sola Scriptura does not entail isolation from the broader Christian tradition.
    - "The Reformed church seeks to be both truly scriptural and truly catholic." ("The Catholicity of Christianity and the Church")

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced articulation of **canon and tradition** has shaped modern Reformed theology’s approach to the authority of Scripture and the value of tradition. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** alongside a positive appreciation for the church’s historical witness continues to influence contemporary discussions on **sola Scriptura** and the role of confessions. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a robust, catholic, and Reformed doctrine of revelation.
