# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a nuanced relationship between **Scripture** and **tradition** within the context of the **Roman Catholic Church**. He affirmed the **primacy of Scripture** as the source of **divine revelation**, while also recognizing the authoritative role of **apostolic tradition** in the transmission and interpretation of the **canon**.

- "It is necessary to receive with reverence whatever is handed down in the canonical Scriptures, but not everything which is contained in the writings of the doctors." (Summa Theologiae, II-II, q.10, a.12)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate
- Catena Aurea

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Scripture in Divine Revelation**
    - Scripture is the highest authority for matters of **faith and morals**.
    - The **canonical books** are received as divinely inspired and normative.
    - All doctrines must be grounded in or consistent with **Scripture**.
    - The Church's teaching authority is subordinate to the authority of the **biblical canon**.
    - "We believe the prophets and apostles because the Lord has been their witness by performing miracles." (Summa Theologiae, II-II, q.1, a.9)

2. **Role of Apostolic Tradition**
    - **Tradition** transmits teachings not explicitly written in Scripture but handed down from the apostles.
    - Apostolic tradition is authoritative when it complements and does not contradict Scripture.
    - The Church preserves and interprets both Scripture and tradition.
    - Some practices and teachings are known only through **unwritten tradition**.
    - "Some things are handed down to us in the Scriptures, others in the tradition of the Church." (Summa Theologiae, II-II, q.1, a.10)

3. **Canon Formation and Authority**
    - The **canon** is determined by the Church’s recognition of inspired books.
    - The Church discerns the canon through the guidance of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Non-canonical writings, even if edifying, lack binding authority.
    - The canon is closed; no new public revelation is expected after the apostolic age.
    - "The canonical Scriptures alone are the rule of faith." (Commentary on the Sentences, I, dist. 19, q.5, a.2)

4. **Interpretation within the Church**
    - The **Magisterium** has the responsibility to interpret Scripture and tradition authentically.
    - Individual interpretation is subject to correction by the Church.
    - The consensus of the **Church Fathers** carries significant interpretive weight.
    - The unity of the Church is maintained through common adherence to Scripture and tradition.
    - "The Church’s authority is needed for the determination of the canonical Scriptures." (Summa Theologiae, I, q.1, a.8)

5. **Distinction between Divine and Ecclesiastical Tradition**
    - **Divine tradition** originates from Christ and the apostles; **ecclesiastical tradition** arises from later Church practice.
    - Only divine tradition is binding in matters of faith.
    - Ecclesiastical traditions may change, but divine tradition is immutable.
    - Proper discernment is necessary to distinguish between these two forms.
    - "Only those traditions are to be held which the universal Church observes, as having been delivered by the apostles." (Summa Theologiae, II-II, q.10, a.12)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **canon and tradition** shaped the doctrinal framework of the Roman Catholic Church and influenced later debates during the Reformation. His distinction between **Scripture** and **apostolic tradition** provided a foundation for Catholic theology’s understanding of authority. Aquinas’s careful articulation of the canon’s primacy, alongside the enduring role of tradition, continues to inform ecumenical dialogues and systematic theology. His legacy endures in both Catholic magisterial teaching and broader Christian thought.
