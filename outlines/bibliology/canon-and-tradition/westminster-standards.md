# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **Scripture** as the sole, sufficient, and infallible rule of **faith and practice**, sharply distinguishing the **canon** from all forms of **tradition**. While acknowledging the church’s historical role in recognizing the **canonical books**, the Standards deny any binding authority to **human traditions** or **ecclesiastical decrees** apart from Scripture.

- "The whole counsel of God...is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men." (Westminster Confession of Faith 1.6)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially Chapter 1: "Of the Holy Scripture")
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 2–5)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 2–3)
- The Directory for Public Worship (regulative principle implications)
- The Form of Presbyterial Church Government (on authority and order)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture Alone as the Rule of Faith**
   - Asserts that **Holy Scripture** is the only infallible rule for faith and obedience.
   - Rejects any parity between Scripture and **tradition** in authority.
   - Affirms that all doctrines must be grounded in Scripture, either explicitly or by "good and necessary consequence."
   - Denies the necessity of unwritten traditions for salvation or Christian living.
   "The Supreme Judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be determined...can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture." (WCF 1.10)

2. **Closed and Defined Canon**
   - Recognizes a fixed list of **canonical books** as inspired and authoritative.
   - Excludes the **Apocrypha** from the canon, denying it any ecclesiastical authority.
   - Grounds the recognition of the canon in the internal testimony of the **Holy Spirit** and the self-authenticating nature of Scripture.
   - Asserts the church’s ministerial, not magisterial, role in recognizing the canon.
   "The books commonly called Apocrypha...are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings." (WCF 1.3)

3. **Tradition as Subordinate and Fallible**
   - Affirms that **church traditions** and councils may err and are not infallible.
   - Permits the use of tradition only insofar as it agrees with and is subordinate to Scripture.
   - Denies that tradition can bind the conscience or add to the content of faith.
   - Recognizes historical creeds and confessions as helpful, but always subject to the Word.
   "All synods or councils, since the Apostles’ times, whether general or particular, may err, and many have erred." (WCF 31.3)

4. **Sufficiency and Perspicuity of Scripture**
   - Teaches that all things necessary for salvation and life are either expressly set down in Scripture or deduced from it.
   - Maintains that Scripture is clear in all matters essential to salvation.
   - Holds that ordinary believers, by due use of ordinary means, can understand necessary truths.
   - Rejects the need for secret traditions or esoteric interpretations.
   "Those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded...that not only the learned, but the unlearned...may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them." (WCF 1.7)

5. **The Role of the Church in Canon and Interpretation**
   - Affirms the church’s responsibility to preserve, transmit, and interpret Scripture.
   - Denies that the church’s authority is equal to or above that of Scripture.
   - Recognizes the church as a witness and keeper of the **canonical books**, not their source.
   - Insists that all church decrees and confessions must be tested by Scripture.
   "The authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church." (WCF 1.4)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** by codifying the principle of **sola Scriptura** and establishing a clear distinction between the **canon** and all forms of tradition. Their articulation of the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture has influenced confessional standards across Presbyterian and Reformed churches worldwide. The Standards continue to serve as a benchmark for debates on the authority of tradition, the nature of the canon, and the role of the church in relation to Scripture.
