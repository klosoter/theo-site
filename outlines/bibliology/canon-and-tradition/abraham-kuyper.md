# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached the question of **canon and tradition** from a distinctly **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the **self-authenticating authority of Scripture** and the necessity of the **Holy Spirit** for its recognition. He was critical of elevating **ecclesiastical tradition** to a normative status alongside or above the **biblical canon**, insisting that the church receives, rather than determines, the canon.

- "The church does not make the canon, but the canon makes the church." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

- Principles of Sacred Theology (1898, English trans. 1954)
- Lectures on Calvinism (1898)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Self-Authenticating Authority**
   - The **canon** possesses inherent authority as the Word of God, not derived from the church.
   - The recognition of canonical books is due to their **divine inspiration** and internal testimony.
   - The **Holy Spirit** enables believers to discern the canon’s authority.
   - The church’s role is receptive, not constitutive, regarding the canon.
   - "The church does not make the canon, but the canon makes the church." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Tradition as Subordinate to Scripture**
   - **Tradition** serves as a witness to the canon but is not a co-equal source of revelation.
   - Ecclesiastical traditions must be tested by the **norm of Scripture**.
   - The Reformation rightly rejected the Roman Catholic elevation of tradition.
   - Tradition has value for historical continuity but not for doctrinal authority.
   - "Tradition may never be placed on a level with the Holy Scriptures." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

3. **Organic Development of the Canon**
   - The **canon** developed organically under God’s providence, not by arbitrary ecclesiastical decree.
   - The process of canonization reflects the Spirit’s work in the church.
   - The unity and coherence of the canon are rooted in its divine origin.
   - Historical recognition of the canon is distinct from its ontological status.
   - "The canon is not the product of a synod, but the fruit of the Spirit’s leading." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

4. **Necessity of the Holy Spirit for Canon Recognition**
   - Human reason alone cannot establish the canon’s authority.
   - The **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** is essential for conviction regarding the canon.
   - Assurance of the canon is a spiritual, not merely historical, matter.
   - The Spirit’s witness is both individual and communal within the church.
   - "Only by the Holy Spirit can we truly recognize the voice of God in Scripture." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

5. **Critical Engagement with Historical Tradition**
   - Kuyper valued the **Reformed confessions** as faithful expressions of biblical truth.
   - He advocated for ongoing reformation of tradition in light of Scripture.
   - Tradition must be critically assessed, not uncritically received.
   - The church’s historical witness is important but always secondary to the canon.
   - "The Reformation was a return to the authority of the Word over the traditions of men." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust articulation of the **self-authenticating canon** and his critique of tradition’s normative status have shaped modern **Reformed theology** and its doctrine of Scripture. His emphasis on the **Holy Spirit’s role** in canon recognition influenced subsequent neo-Calvinist and evangelical thought. Kuyper’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between **Scripture, tradition, and ecclesial authority** within Protestantism.
