# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a staunch defender of the **Reformed doctrine of Scripture**, emphasizing the **inspiration**, **inerrancy**, and **sufficiency** of the biblical canon. He maintained that **tradition** must always be subordinate to the **Scriptures**, which alone possess divine authority, and he critiqued any elevation of ecclesiastical tradition that compromised the **finality of the canon**.

- "The Church did not make the New Testament, but the New Testament made the Church." ("The Formation of the Canon of the New Testament")

## Key Works

- "The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible"
- "The Formation of the Canon of the New Testament"
- "Westminster Doctrine of Holy Scripture"
- "The Right of Systematic Theology"
- Selected articles in The Princeton Theological Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canon is Closed and Authoritative**
    - The **biblical canon** is fixed and not open to addition or subtraction.
    - The canon derives its authority from its divine origin, not from church recognition.
    - The process of canonization was providentially guided, not ecclesiastically determined.
    - The church’s role is to recognize, not establish, the canon.
    - "The New Testament books did not become authoritative for the Church because they were formally included in a canonical list; on the contrary, the Church included them in her canon because she already accounted them divinely authoritative." ("The Formation of the Canon of the New Testament")

2. **Scripture as the Only Infallible Rule**
    - **Sola Scriptura** is foundational: Scripture alone is the ultimate standard for faith and practice.
    - All traditions must be tested by the teaching of Scripture.
    - Human traditions are fallible and secondary to the Word of God.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture excludes the necessity of extra-biblical tradition for doctrine.
    - "Tradition is valuable only as it is true to the Scriptures, and is to be rejected when it departs from them." ("The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible")

3. **Organic Inspiration of Scripture**
    - The Holy Spirit superintended the human authors without overriding their personalities.
    - Inspiration extends to the very words of Scripture (**verbal plenary inspiration**).
    - The authority of Scripture is rooted in its divine inspiration.
    - The canon is inspired as a whole, not merely in parts.
    - "Inspiration is that extraordinary, supernatural influence... by which their writings are given the character of infallible truth." ("The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible")

4. **Tradition’s Derivative Authority**
    - Tradition has a ministerial, not magisterial, role in the church.
    - The value of tradition lies in its faithfulness to the biblical witness.
    - Creeds and confessions are helpful but subordinate to Scripture.
    - The Reformation was a recovery of the primacy of Scripture over tradition.
    - "The Reformation principle was the absolute supremacy of the Scriptures as the rule of faith." ("The Westminster Doctrine of Holy Scripture")

5. **Providence in Canon Formation**
    - God sovereignly directed the recognition of the canon in the early church.
    - The historical process of canonization reflects divine providence, not mere human decision.
    - The consensus of the church was an effect, not a cause, of the canon’s authority.
    - The Spirit’s witness in the church confirmed the canon’s boundaries.
    - "The formation of the canon was not the cause but the consequence of the authority of the books." ("The Formation of the Canon of the New Testament")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **inspiration and authority of Scripture** shaped generations of Reformed and evangelical theologians, especially at Princeton Seminary. His articulation of the relationship between **canon and tradition** remains a touchstone for those upholding **Sola Scriptura**. Warfield’s work continues to inform debates on the sufficiency of Scripture and the proper role of tradition in the life of the church.
