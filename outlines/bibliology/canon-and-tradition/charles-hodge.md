# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge maintained that the **canon of Scripture** is divinely constituted and self-authenticating, while **tradition** serves a subordinate, ministerial role in the life of the church. He insisted that **Scripture alone** is the ultimate rule of faith and practice, and that the church recognizes but does not determine the canon, rejecting any notion of tradition as an independent or co-equal source of authority.

- "The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the only infallible rule of faith and practice." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on the authority of Scripture and tradition

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole Infallible Rule**
    - The **canon** is established by divine inspiration, not ecclesiastical decree.
    - **Tradition** is valuable only insofar as it agrees with Scripture.
    - The **church** recognizes the canon but does not confer authority upon it.
    - All doctrines must be tested by the **Word of God** alone.
    - "The Bible, and the Bible alone, is the religion of Protestants." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Recognition, Not Creation, of the Canon**
    - The church’s role is to discern, not to create, the canon.
    - Canonical books possess intrinsic marks of **divine authority**.
    - Early church consensus is evidence, not the ground, of canonicity.
    - The **Holy Spirit** confirms the canon to believers.
    - "The Church no more made the canon than Newton made the law of gravitation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Tradition as Ministerial, Not Magisterial**
    - **Tradition** is subordinate to Scripture and must be evaluated by it.
    - Historical creeds and confessions are useful summaries, not sources, of doctrine.
    - Tradition can err and has erred; it is not infallible.
    - The Reformation rightly rejected the parity of tradition and Scripture.
    - "Tradition is human; the Scriptures are divine." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Sufficiency and Perspicuity of Scripture**
    - Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation and faith.
    - The meaning of Scripture is clear in matters essential to salvation.
    - No supplementary revelation or tradition is needed for the church’s faith.
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables understanding of Scripture’s message.
    - "Nothing is necessary to be believed but what is clearly revealed in the Bible." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Rejection of Rome’s Two-Source Theory**
    - The Roman Catholic view of Scripture and tradition as two sources is unscriptural.
    - This theory undermines the **sufficiency** and finality of Scripture.
    - Hodge critiques the elevation of unwritten tradition to canonical status.
    - He affirms the **Reformation principle** of sola Scriptura.
    - "The Romish doctrine of tradition is inconsistent with the nature of revelation and the authority of the Scriptures." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of **sola Scriptura** shaped generations of Reformed theology, especially at Princeton Seminary. His clear distinction between **canon** and **tradition** provided a bulwark against both Roman Catholic and liberal Protestant views that threatened the unique authority of Scripture. Hodge’s work remains a touchstone for debates on the relationship between the Bible and church tradition, reinforcing the enduring Reformed commitment to the primacy of the Word of God.
