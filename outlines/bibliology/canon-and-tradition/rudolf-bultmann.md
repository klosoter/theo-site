# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the question of **canon and tradition** through the lens of his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He viewed the **New Testament canon** not as a fixed deposit of propositional truth but as a witness to the **kerygma**—the proclamation of Christ—mediated through the early church’s tradition and shaped by existential concerns. For Bultmann, the authority of the canon is inseparable from the ongoing act of interpretation within the community of faith.

- "The real authority of the New Testament lies not in its letter, but in the kerygma to which it bears witness." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948–1953)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting" (1956)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of the Canon**
    - The New Testament contains mythological elements shaped by ancient worldviews.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential message behind these forms.
    - The canon’s authority is not in myth but in the existential truth it mediates.
    - Tradition is a vehicle for the kerygma, not an end in itself.
    - "What matters is not the mythological world picture but the existential understanding of human existence." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The core of Christian proclamation is the kerygma, not the canonical text per se.
    - The kerygma is mediated through tradition but transcends its historical forms.
    - Faith arises from encounter with the proclaimed word, not mere assent to tradition.
    - The canon serves as a witness to the kerygma, not as an infallible rule.
    - "Faith is not assent to doctrines but decision in response to the kerygma." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Historicity and Interpretation**
    - The canon is a product of the early church’s historical situation.
    - Tradition reflects the existential concerns of its original context.
    - Interpretation must account for the historical distance between text and reader.
    - The meaning of the canon is actualized in existential encounter, not in historical reconstruction alone.
    - "The task of interpretation is to make the message of the New Testament intelligible to modern man." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Critical Engagement with Tradition**
    - Tradition is not immune to critique; it must be evaluated in light of existential relevance.
    - The church’s tradition is dynamic, not static.
    - Critical scholarship is necessary to distinguish the essential from the contingent in tradition.
    - The authority of tradition is provisional, subject to the ongoing event of proclamation.
    - "Tradition must be interpreted, not simply repeated." (Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting)

5. **Existential Encounter as Norm**
    - The norm for theology is the existential encounter with the Word, not the canon as a closed system.
    - The canon’s authority is derivative, grounded in its capacity to mediate authentic existence.
    - Tradition is valuable insofar as it facilitates existential decision.
    - The church is called to continual reinterpretation in light of contemporary existence.
    - "The Word of God happens as event in the proclamation." (History and Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **canon and tradition** profoundly influenced twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **biblical hermeneutics** and existential interpretation. His emphasis on the **kerygma** and the necessity of demythologization challenged traditional views of scriptural authority and inspired both critical engagement and significant controversy. While many have critiqued his reduction of tradition to existential categories, his work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between the biblical canon, tradition, and contemporary faith.
