# Bruce Metzger (1914–2007)

Bruce Metzger was a leading authority on the **New Testament canon** and the history of **Christian tradition**. He emphasized the complex historical process by which the **biblical canon** was recognized, highlighting the interplay between **scripture** and **church tradition** in the early centuries of Christianity.

- "The canon of the New Testament was not the result of a single act or decision, but was the outcome of a long process in which usage, tradition, and theological reflection all played a part." (The Canon of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance
- The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration
- The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission, and Limitations
- The Oxford Companion to the Bible (co-editor)
- Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Greek Palaeography

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canon as a Historical Process**
   - The **New Testament canon** developed gradually over several centuries.
   - Early Christian communities used a variety of texts before consensus emerged.
   - The process was influenced by **liturgical use**, **apostolic authority**, and **orthodoxy**.
   - Metzger rejected the idea of a sudden or arbitrary canonization.
   - "The canon was the result of a process of recognition, not imposition." (The Canon of the New Testament)

2. **Tradition’s Role in Canon Formation**
   - **Church tradition** played a vital role in discerning authoritative texts.
   - The criteria for canonicity included conformity to the **rule of faith**.
   - Early church fathers and councils reflected on tradition to guide decisions.
   - Tradition was not infallible, but it was indispensable in the canonization process.
   - "Tradition served as a guide in the recognition of those writings which were to be regarded as canonical." (The Canon of the New Testament)

3. **Scripture’s Authority Rooted in Apostolicity**
   - Apostolic origin was a primary criterion for inclusion in the canon.
   - Writings linked to the apostles were seen as bearing unique authority.
   - The church’s recognition of these texts was a response to their intrinsic value.
   - Metzger emphasized the importance of **apostolic witness** for scriptural authority.
   - "Apostolicity was the touchstone by which the church measured the authority of writings." (The Canon of the New Testament)

4. **Textual Criticism and Canon**
   - Careful **textual criticism** is essential for understanding the canon’s development.
   - Manuscript evidence reveals the diversity and transmission of early Christian texts.
   - Metzger advocated for rigorous scholarly methods in evaluating textual variants.
   - The stability of the canon is related to the reliability of the text.
   - "Textual criticism provides the tools necessary for reconstructing the history of the canon." (The Text of the New Testament)

5. **Distinction Between Canon and Scripture**
   - Metzger distinguished between the existence of **scriptural texts** and their formal recognition as canon.
   - Some writings were considered authoritative before being officially canonized.
   - The process of canonization clarified, rather than created, the status of these texts.
   - The church’s role was to recognize, not bestow, canonical authority.
   - "The church did not create the canon; it recognized the books that were already regarded as authoritative." (The Canon of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Metzger’s scholarship profoundly shaped modern understanding of the **New Testament canon** and its relationship to **Christian tradition**. His meticulous historical and textual research set a standard for subsequent generations of biblical scholars. By clarifying the interplay between tradition and scripture, Metzger influenced both academic and ecclesial discussions on biblical authority. His work remains foundational for those studying the origins and transmission of the Christian Bible.
