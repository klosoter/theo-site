# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the question of **canon and tradition** through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the **divine authorship** and **self-attesting authority** of Scripture. He argued that the **canon** is fundamentally shaped by its role as a **covenant document**, with tradition serving a ministerial—not magisterial—function in the church’s recognition of the canon.

- "The canon of Scripture is the documentary deposit of God's covenant lordship." ("The Structure of Biblical Authority")

## Key Works

- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- Treaty of the Great King
- Kingdom Prologue
- By Oath Consigned
- "Canon and Covenant" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canon as Covenant Document**
   - The canon is constituted by documents that serve as the written form of God's covenant with His people.
   - The structure and function of ancient Near Eastern treaties illuminate the form and authority of biblical canon.
   - Canonical books are those that bear the marks of divine covenantal authorship and authority.
   - The canon is not determined by the church but recognized as the covenantal Word of God.
   - "The Bible is the documentary form of the covenant relationship between God and his people." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

2. **Self-Attestation of Scripture**
   - Scripture possesses intrinsic authority as the voice of the covenant Lord.
   - The self-authenticating nature of Scripture is grounded in its divine origin and covenantal function.
   - The church’s recognition of canon is a response to, not a cause of, its authority.
   - Tradition is subordinate to the self-attesting witness of Scripture.
   - "The church does not confer authority on the canon; it acknowledges the authority inherent in the covenant documents." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

3. **Ministerial Role of Tradition**
   - Tradition serves to guide the church in recognizing and transmitting the canon.
   - The authority of tradition is always derivative and subordinate to Scripture.
   - Historical reception and use of canonical books are important but not determinative.
   - The Spirit works through tradition to lead the church to a right recognition of the canon.
   - "Tradition is a ministerial instrument, not a magisterial authority, in the process of canon recognition." ("Canon and Covenant")

4. **Covenantal Structure of Revelation**
   - Divine revelation is structured by the pattern of covenant, with Scripture as the written treaty.
   - The form and content of the canon reflect the suzerain-vassal treaty model.
   - The canonical process is inseparable from the unfolding of redemptive history.
   - The closure of the canon corresponds to the completion of the covenantal administration.
   - "The canon is closed when the covenantal administration it documents is complete." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

5. **Rejection of Ecclesiastical Magisterium**
   - The church does not possess magisterial authority to define or add to the canon.
   - The authority of the canon is not dependent on ecclesiastical decree or consensus.
   - The church’s role is to receive, preserve, and proclaim the canonical Scriptures.
   - Any appeal to tradition or church authority must be tested by the covenantal Word itself.
   - "The magisterial authority belongs to the covenant Lord whose Word is the canon, not to the church as an institution." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal approach to **canon and tradition** has significantly shaped Reformed understandings of biblical authority and the nature of Scripture. His emphasis on the **self-attesting, covenantal character** of the canon provided a robust theological alternative to both Roman Catholic and liberal Protestant models. Kline’s work continues to influence discussions on the relationship between **Scripture, tradition, and ecclesial authority** within confessional Reformed circles.
