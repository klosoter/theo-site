# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the question of **canon and tradition** from a distinctly **Reformed** and **presuppositional** perspective, emphasizing the **self-authenticating authority of Scripture** and the necessity of **sola Scriptura**. He affirms the importance of **tradition** as a ministerial guide but insists that it must always be subordinate to the **biblical canon**, which is the ultimate norm for faith and practice.

- "Scripture is the supreme authority, and tradition is authoritative only insofar as it agrees with Scripture." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2009)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- "Scripture and Tradition" in The Collected Shorter Writings of John Frame, Vol. 1 (2012)
- Apologetics to the Glory of God (1994)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Self-Authenticating Canon**
    - The **canon** is not established by the church but recognized by it as God's Word.
    - The authority of Scripture is intrinsic, not derived from external sources.
    - The Holy Spirit testifies to the believer regarding the authenticity of the canon.
    - The canon is closed and normative for all doctrine and practice.
    - "The church does not create the canon; it receives and recognizes it." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

2. **Tradition as Ministerial, Not Magisterial**
    - **Tradition** serves the church by preserving and transmitting biblical teaching.
    - Tradition is valuable but always subject to correction by Scripture.
    - The church's creeds and confessions are helpful summaries, not infallible authorities.
    - Historical theology aids interpretation but does not bind the conscience.
    - "Tradition is a valuable teacher, but it must always be tested by the Word of God." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

3. **Sola Scriptura as Foundational Principle**
    - **Sola Scriptura** means Scripture alone is the final authority in all matters of faith.
    - All other authorities, including tradition, reason, and experience, are subordinate.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture is central to Christian epistemology.
    - The clarity of Scripture ensures its accessibility to the church.
    - "Sola Scriptura is not a denial of other authorities, but a recognition of their subordinate role." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

4. **Presuppositional Epistemology**
    - Knowledge of the canon and its authority is grounded in **presuppositions** shaped by God's revelation.
    - Human reason and tradition are insufficient apart from divine revelation.
    - The authority of Scripture is a necessary starting point for all theological reflection.
    - The recognition of canon is an act of faith enabled by the Spirit.
    - "Our ultimate criterion must be God's own revelation, not human tradition or reasoning." (Apologetics to the Glory of God)

5. **Multiperspectival Approach to Authority**
    - Authority is understood through **normative** (Scripture), **situational** (history/tradition), and **existential** (personal/communal) perspectives.
    - Tradition is best evaluated in light of all three perspectives, with Scripture as the norm.
    - The interplay of perspectives guards against reductionism in understanding authority.
    - This approach fosters humility and discernment in theological method.
    - "We must consider the normative, situational, and existential perspectives, but Scripture always has the final word." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s robust articulation of **sola Scriptura** and his nuanced treatment of **tradition** have significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially among those influenced by **presuppositional apologetics**. His **multiperspectivalism** has provided a flexible yet orthodox framework for evaluating the relationship between canon and tradition. Frame’s work continues to inform debates on biblical authority, the role of confessions, and the proper use of historical theology within the church.
