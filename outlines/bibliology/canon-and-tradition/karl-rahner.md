# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the question of **canon and tradition** through the lens of **transcendental theology** and the **development of doctrine** within the **Roman Catholic Church**. He emphasized the dynamic relationship between **Scripture**, **Church tradition**, and the ongoing presence of the **Holy Spirit** in guiding the Church’s understanding of revelation.

- "Scripture and tradition are not two sources of revelation, but two modes of transmission of the one revelation." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 6)

## Key Works

- Theological Investigations, Vol. 6: "The Question of the Concept of Tradition"
- Foundations of Christian Faith
- Inspiration in the Bible (in Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)
- "Observations on the Problem of the 'Canon' in Theology" (Theological Investigations, Vol. 6)
- "Scripture and Tradition" (in Sacramentum Mundi)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Revelation**
    - Revelation is a single, unified reality, not divided between **Scripture** and **tradition**.
    - Both Scripture and tradition are modes of transmitting the one revelation of God in Christ.
    - The Church, guided by the **Holy Spirit**, discerns and preserves this unity.
    - The canon is not a closed set of propositions but a living witness to revelation.
    - "Revelation is not a collection of truths, but the self-communication of God." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Tradition as Living Transmission**
    - Tradition is not merely the repetition of past teachings but an active, living process.
    - The Church’s **magisterium** plays a key role in interpreting and transmitting tradition.
    - Tradition develops in response to new historical and cultural contexts.
    - The Holy Spirit ensures the fidelity of tradition to the original revelation.
    - "Tradition is the living process by which the Church, under the guidance of the Spirit, hands on the Gospel." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 6)

3. **Scripture within the Church**
    - The **canon of Scripture** is recognized and preserved within the life of the Church.
    - The Church precedes the canon logically, as it is the community that recognizes and interprets Scripture.
    - Scripture’s authority is inseparable from the interpretive authority of the Church.
    - The meaning of Scripture unfolds through the Church’s ongoing reflection and teaching.
    - "The Church is the bearer of the canon, not vice versa." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 6)

4. **Development of Doctrine**
    - The understanding of revelation grows over time through the Church’s reflection.
    - Doctrinal development is guided by the Spirit and remains faithful to the original revelation.
    - Tradition is dynamic, not static, allowing for authentic growth in understanding.
    - The canon serves as a norm, but its interpretation is not fixed once for all.
    - "The development of doctrine is the Church’s response to the inexhaustible depth of revelation." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Rejection of a Dual-Source Theory**
    - Rahner rejects the idea that Scripture and tradition are two separate sources of revelation.
    - Both are expressions of the one revelation, differentiated only in mode, not content.
    - The so-called "material sufficiency" of Scripture is not opposed to the necessity of tradition.
    - The Church’s teaching authority mediates both Scripture and tradition as a unified whole.
    - "There are not two sources of revelation, but one revelation in two forms of transmission." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 6)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s theology of **canon and tradition** significantly shaped post-Vatican II Catholic thought, especially in articulating the relationship between **Scripture**, **tradition**, and the **magisterium**. His emphasis on the unity of revelation and the dynamic, living character of tradition influenced both ecumenical dialogue and the Church’s self-understanding. Rahner’s work continues to inform contemporary debates on doctrinal development and the authority of the Church in interpreting revelation.
