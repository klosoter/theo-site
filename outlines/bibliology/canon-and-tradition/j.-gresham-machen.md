# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen vigorously defended the **authority of Scripture** and the uniqueness of the **biblical canon** against the encroachments of modernist theology. He argued that **tradition** must always be subordinate to the **inspired, infallible Word of God**, and that the church’s authority is derived from its faithfulness to the canonical Scriptures, not from ecclesiastical tradition or evolving doctrinal consensus.

- "The Christian religion flourishes not in the darkness, but in the light; and the Bible, which is at the basis of the Christian religion, is not a book of mysteries, but a book which may be understood." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Key Works

- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- The Origin of Paul's Religion (1921)
- The New Testament: An Introduction to Its Literature and History (1915)
- What Is Faith? (1925)
- The Christian View of Man (posthumous, 1947)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Supreme Authority**
   - The **canon of Scripture** is the ultimate standard for faith and practice.
   - All church traditions must be tested by the teaching of the Bible.
   - Human traditions, however venerable, are fallible and secondary.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture excludes any supplementary source of revelation.
   - "The Scriptures are the norm by which all other authorities are to be judged." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Canon Defined by Apostolic Origin**
   - The **New Testament canon** is grounded in apostolic witness and authorship.
   - The church recognizes, but does not create, the canon.
   - Apostolicity, orthodoxy, and catholicity are key criteria for canonicity.
   - The canon is closed; no new revelation is to be added.
   - "The New Testament books are historical documents, and their authority rests upon their apostolic origin." (The Origin of Paul's Religion)

3. **Tradition as Ministerial, Not Magisterial**
   - Tradition serves the church by preserving and transmitting biblical truth.
   - It must never be elevated above or placed alongside Scripture.
   - The Reformation principle of **sola Scriptura** is essential for doctrinal purity.
   - Traditions contrary to Scripture must be rejected.
   - "The real authority, for the Christian, is not the voice of the church but the Bible." (Christianity and Liberalism)

4. **Historical Reliability of the Canon**
   - The formation of the canon is rooted in historical events and divine providence.
   - Machen defended the authenticity and integrity of the biblical text.
   - He opposed critical theories that undermined the canon’s reliability.
   - The canon’s historical foundation supports its theological authority.
   - "The New Testament is not a collection of myths, but a trustworthy record of historical facts." (The Origin of Paul's Religion)

5. **Opposition to Modernist Redefinitions**
   - Modernist appeals to evolving tradition threaten the fixed authority of the canon.
   - Machen critiqued attempts to subordinate Scripture to contemporary experience or reason.
   - He warned against diluting the gospel by adapting it to cultural trends.
   - The church’s vitality depends on fidelity to the canonical Scriptures.
   - "The modern liberal preacher is really rejecting the authority of the Bible." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s robust defense of the **authority of the biblical canon** and his critique of tradition’s misuse shaped 20th-century American Presbyterianism and the broader evangelical movement. His work laid the groundwork for the formation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and influenced generations of Reformed theologians committed to **sola Scriptura**. Machen’s insistence on the primacy of Scripture over tradition remains a touchstone for conservative Protestant theology, especially in debates over doctrinal authority and ecclesiastical identity.
