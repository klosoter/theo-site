# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the question of **canon and tradition** from a distinctly **Reformed** and **presuppositional** standpoint, emphasizing the **self-attesting authority of Scripture** and the necessity of a **biblical epistemology**. He rejected any notion of an autonomous tradition standing alongside or above the **Scriptural canon**, insisting that all tradition must be normed by the **Word of God** as the ultimate standard.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Self-Attesting Canon**
    - The **canon** is authoritative because it is the very Word of God, not because of ecclesiastical endorsement.
    - The **Holy Spirit** testifies internally to the truth of Scripture, making it self-authenticating.
    - The church recognizes, but does not constitute, the canon.
    - Any appeal to tradition must be subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
    - "The Bible is authoritative on everything of which it speaks and it speaks of everything." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Tradition as Ministerial, Not Magisterial**
    - **Tradition** serves the church by preserving and transmitting biblical teaching, but cannot override or supplement Scripture.
    - The Reformed confessions are valuable only insofar as they reflect biblical truth.
    - Human tradition is always subject to error and must be critiqued by the Word.
    - The church’s authority is ministerial, not legislative, regarding doctrine.
    - "Tradition must always be tested by the infallible rule of Scripture." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Antithesis Between Reformed and Roman Catholic Views**
    - Van Til sharply contrasts the **Reformed** doctrine of sola Scriptura with the Roman Catholic elevation of tradition.
    - He argues that Rome’s view leads to an autonomous authority outside of Scripture.
    - The Reformed position maintains the sufficiency and clarity of the biblical canon.
    - Any parity between tradition and Scripture undermines the unique authority of God’s Word.
    - "Rome places tradition alongside Scripture, but the Reformed faith insists on Scripture alone." (The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture)

4. **Presuppositional Epistemology and Canon**
    - Knowledge of the canon is possible only by presupposing the truth of Scripture itself.
    - Neutrality is impossible; all reasoning is either based on God’s revelation or on human autonomy.
    - The recognition of the canon is an act of obedience to God’s self-revelation.
    - The authority of the canon is not established by historical or rational proofs alone.
    - "We must presuppose the truth of the Christian position in order to defend it." (Christian Apologetics)

5. **The Role of the Holy Spirit in Canon and Tradition**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables believers to recognize the canon as God’s Word.
    - The Spirit guides the church in understanding and applying Scripture, not in adding to it.
    - Tradition is useful only as it is illumined and corrected by the Spirit through the Word.
    - The Spirit’s witness is necessary for the proper use and interpretation of both canon and tradition.
    - "It is the Spirit of God who must witness to the authority of the Word of God." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of **sola Scriptura** and his critique of autonomous tradition have profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and theology. His emphasis on the **self-attesting nature of the canon** and the necessity of a presuppositional approach to epistemology continues to influence debates on the relationship between Scripture and tradition. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing insistence that all tradition must be normed by the infallible Word of God.
