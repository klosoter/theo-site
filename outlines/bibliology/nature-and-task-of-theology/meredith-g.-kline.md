# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the **nature and task of theology** through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the importance of **biblical revelation** as the foundation for all theological reflection. He insisted that theology is fundamentally an exercise in interpreting **God’s self-disclosure** within the **covenantal structure** of Scripture, and that the theologian’s task is to expound the meaning and implications of this revelation for the church and the world.

- "Theology is the discipline of interpreting the authoritative revelation of God, structured by the divine covenants." (Kingdom Prologue)

    - The **covenant** serves as the organizing principle for understanding God’s relationship with humanity.
    - The structure and content of theology are shaped by the historical unfolding of **redemptive covenants**.
    - Theologians must interpret biblical data in light of the **covenant documents**.
    - "The divine covenants are the backbone of biblical revelation and thus of theology." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Revelation is authoritative and foundational**
    - **Scripture** is the supreme authority for theology, as it is the inspired record of God’s revelation.
    - Theology is not speculative but is an exposition of what God has revealed.
    - The authority of theology derives from its faithfulness to the **canonical text**.
    - The task of theology is to serve the church by clarifying and defending the truth of revelation.
    - "Theology is the servant of revelation, not its master." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

3. **Theology is exegetical and redemptive-historical**
    - Theological method must be rooted in careful **exegesis** of the biblical text.
    - The unfolding of **redemptive history** provides the context for all doctrinal formulation.
    - The unity of Scripture is seen in the progressive revelation of God’s redemptive purposes.
    - The theologian’s role is to trace the development of **covenant themes** across the canon.
    - "Biblical theology is the tracing of the redemptive-historical development of God’s covenantal dealings." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Theology is polemical and apologetic**
    - Theologians must defend the faith against false interpretations and rival worldviews.
    - The **covenantal structure** provides the basis for critiquing non-biblical theologies.
    - Apologetics is an integral part of the theological task, rooted in the authority of revelation.
    - The church’s confession must be maintained and articulated in the face of opposition.
    - "Theology must be vigilant in guarding the integrity of the covenantal revelation." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

5. **Theology serves the church’s worship and mission**
    - The ultimate aim of theology is to glorify God and edify his people.
    - Theological reflection informs and shapes the church’s **worship**, sacraments, and mission.
    - The covenant community is both the context and the beneficiary of theological work.
    - Theology must be practical, equipping the church for faithful witness in the world.
    - "Theology is for the life and worship of the covenant community." (By Oath Consigned)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal approach to the **nature and task of theology** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed thought, especially in the areas of **biblical theology** and hermeneutics. His insistence on the centrality of **covenant structure** and redemptive history has influenced generations of scholars and pastors. Kline’s work continues to challenge theologians to ground their reflection in the authoritative revelation of Scripture and to serve the church’s mission with theological clarity and fidelity.
