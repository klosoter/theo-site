# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth revolutionized the **nature and task of theology** by insisting that theology is a discipline grounded in **God’s self-revelation** rather than human religious experience or philosophical speculation. For Barth, theology’s task is to listen to, critically examine, and proclaim the **Word of God** as revealed in **Jesus Christ**, always maintaining the distinction between **Creator and creature** and the primacy of **divine initiative**.

- "Dogmatics is the scientific self-examination of the Christian Church with respect to the content of its distinctive talk about God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- The Humanity of God
- The Word of God and the Word of Man
- Protestant Theology in the Nineteenth Century

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as the Science of the Word of God**
    - Theology is not a neutral science but is defined by its object: **God’s revelation**.
    - Theological method is shaped by the reality of **God speaking**.
    - The church’s proclamation, Scripture, and revelation are united in the **Word of God**.
    - Human reason is subordinate to the initiative of divine self-disclosure.
    - "Theology is science seeking the knowledge of the Word of God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Revelation as Event**
    - Revelation is not a static deposit but a living, dynamic **event**.
    - God reveals Himself freely and sovereignly in **Jesus Christ**.
    - Theological knowledge depends on God’s ongoing act of self-revelation.
    - Scripture is the witness to revelation, not revelation itself in abstraction.
    - "Revelation means the self-unveiling, impartation and impartedness of God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **Christocentric Focus**
    - All theology centers on the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ is both the content and the criterion of all theological reflection.
    - The knowledge of God is mediated exclusively through Christ.
    - Theological statements must be measured by their conformity to Christ.
    - "Jesus Christ is the one Word of God which we have to hear and which we have to trust and obey in life and in death." (Barmen Declaration)

4. **Dialectical Method**
    - Theology must always hold together **affirmation and negation** (yes and no).
    - Human language is inadequate to fully capture divine reality.
    - The distinction between **God and humanity** is never overcome.
    - Theologians must speak with humility, aware of the limits of their knowledge.
    - "We must speak of God, but we cannot speak of God." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

5. **Theological Task as Service to the Church**
    - Theology is a critical, reflective service to the **Christian community**.
    - Its task is to test and clarify the church’s proclamation.
    - Theologians are responsible to the church and ultimately to God.
    - Theology is always provisional and reformable.
    - "Dogmatics is a function of the teaching office of the Church." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s redefinition of the **nature and task of theology** profoundly shaped twentieth-century Protestant thought, especially through his emphasis on **revelation** and the **centrality of Christ**. His insistence on theology’s dependence on God’s self-disclosure challenged both liberal and conservative paradigms. Barth’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between **Scripture, revelation, and theological method**, making him a pivotal figure in modern systematic theology.
