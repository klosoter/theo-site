# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther understood the **nature and task of theology** as fundamentally oriented toward the revelation of **God in Christ** through **Scripture**. He emphasized the distinction between the **theology of the cross** and the **theology of glory**, insisting that true theology arises from faith in God's self-disclosure, not human speculation or philosophical reasoning.

- "The true theologian is he who comprehends the visible and manifest things of God seen through suffering and the cross." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 20)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans (1522)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Genesis

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology of the Cross**
   - True theology recognizes God’s revelation in the suffering and crucifixion of Christ.
   - Rejects human wisdom and glory as sources of theological knowledge.
   - Emphasizes the hiddenness of God’s work in apparent weakness and folly.
   - Contrasts sharply with the "theology of glory," which seeks God through human achievement.
   - "He deserves to be called a theologian, however, who comprehends the visible and manifest things of God seen through suffering and the cross." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 20)

2. **Primacy of Scripture (Sola Scriptura)**
   - Scripture is the only infallible source and norm for theology.
   - All doctrines and traditions must be tested by the Word of God.
   - The Holy Spirit works through Scripture to create faith and understanding.
   - Human reason is subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
   - "The Word of God shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel." (Smalcald Articles II.2)

3. **Justification by Faith Alone (Sola Fide)**
   - Theology’s central task is to proclaim justification by faith apart from works.
   - The knowledge of God is inseparable from trust in Christ’s promise.
   - Theologians must distinguish law and gospel to avoid confusion of works and grace.
   - Faith itself is a gift, not a human achievement.
   - "Faith is a living, daring confidence in God’s grace, so sure and certain that a man would stake his life on it a thousand times." (Preface to Romans)

4. **Distinction Between Law and Gospel**
   - Proper theology discerns the difference between God’s commands (law) and promises (gospel).
   - The law reveals sin and drives sinners to Christ.
   - The gospel offers forgiveness and new life through Christ alone.
   - Mixing law and gospel leads to theological and pastoral error.
   - "The distinction between law and gospel is the highest art in Christendom." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Theology as a Pastoral and Practical Discipline**
   - Theology serves the church by comforting consciences and guiding believers.
   - Theologians are called to serve, not to speculate or dominate.
   - The task of theology is inseparable from preaching and pastoral care.
   - True theology is lived out in faith and love, not abstract speculation.
   - "Theology is practical; its end is faith and a good conscience." (Table Talk)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s approach to the **nature and task of theology** reshaped the Western church, grounding theological reflection in **Scripture** and the proclamation of **justification by faith**. His insistence on the **theology of the cross** continues to challenge triumphalistic or speculative tendencies in Christian thought. Luther’s legacy endures in Protestant emphasis on the authority of Scripture, the centrality of Christ, and the pastoral vocation of theology. His influence remains foundational for all subsequent Reformation and evangelical theology.
