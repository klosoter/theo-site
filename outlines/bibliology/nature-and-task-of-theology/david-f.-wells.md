# David F. Wells (1939– )

David F. Wells is a contemporary Reformed theologian whose work critically examines the **nature and task of theology** in the context of modernity and evangelicalism. He contends that theology must be rooted in the **objective revelation of God**, maintain the **centrality of doctrine**, and resist the encroachment of **cultural accommodation**. Wells is particularly concerned with the loss of **theological seriousness** and the eclipse of **God’s transcendence** in the church’s life and thought.

- "The disappearance of theology from the life of the church, and the orchestration of that disappearance by some of its leaders, is hard to miss." (No Place for Truth)

## Key Works

- No Place for Truth, or, Whatever Happened to Evangelical Theology? (1993)
- God in the Wasteland: The Reality of Truth in a World of Fading Dreams (1994)
- Losing Our Virtue: Why the Church Must Recover Its Moral Vision (1998)
- Above All Earthly Pow’rs: Christ in a Postmodern World (2005)
- The Courage to Be Protestant: Reformation Faith in Today's World (2008)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology is grounded in divine revelation**
    - Theology must begin with **God’s self-disclosure** in Scripture.
    - Human experience or culture cannot serve as the primary source for theology.
    - The **authority of Scripture** is non-negotiable for theological reflection.
    - Theological method is shaped by the **objective reality of God**.
    - "Theology is about God, not about us." (No Place for Truth)

2. **Doctrine is central to the church’s identity**
    - The church’s life and witness depend on robust doctrinal foundations.
    - **Doctrinal seriousness** guards against theological drift and cultural assimilation.
    - The loss of doctrine leads to the loss of the church’s distinctiveness.
    - Doctrine must be confessed, taught, and lived out in the community.
    - "Where doctrine has been lost, Christian faith has been lost." (God in the Wasteland)

3. **Theology must resist cultural accommodation**
    - Theological method must not be dictated by the spirit of the age.
    - **Modernity** and **postmodernity** pose unique challenges to theological integrity.
    - The church is tempted to prioritize relevance over faithfulness.
    - True theology critiques culture from the standpoint of **biblical truth**.
    - "The church has become a mirror of the world rather than its conscience." (No Place for Truth)

4. **The transcendence and holiness of God are foundational**
    - The loss of **God’s transcendence** leads to trivialization of faith.
    - Theology must recover a sense of the **holy** and the **majestic**.
    - Worship and doctrine are diminished when God’s otherness is neglected.
    - The task of theology is to point beyond human concerns to the reality of God.
    - "God rests too inconsequentially upon the church." (God in the Wasteland)

5. **Theology serves the renewal and mission of the church**
    - Theological reflection is not merely academic but vital for the church’s health.
    - **Theological renewal** is necessary for authentic spiritual renewal.
    - The church’s mission is compromised when theology is marginalized.
    - Theology equips the church to engage the world with truth and grace.
    - "Without theology, the church loses its identity and its mission." (The Courage to Be Protestant)

## Legacy and Impact

Wells’s critique of **evangelical theology’s accommodation to culture** has shaped contemporary discussions about the identity and mission of the church. His call to recover the **centrality of doctrine** and the **transcendence of God** has influenced pastors, scholars, and church leaders seeking theological renewal. Wells’s work remains a significant voice urging the church to resist the pressures of modernity and to reclaim a robust, confessional theology for the sake of faithful witness.
