# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas understood the **nature and task of theology** as a **scientia**—a rational, ordered discipline grounded in **divine revelation** and oriented toward the **knowledge of God**. He distinguished **sacred doctrine** from other sciences by its supernatural source and its ultimate end: leading humans to **beatific vision**. For Aquinas, theology integrates **faith and reason**, employing philosophical tools in service of understanding revealed truth.

- "Sacred doctrine is a science because it proceeds from principles established by the light of a higher science, namely, the science of God and the blessed." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I, q.1: "The Nature and Extent of Sacred Doctrine")
- Summa Contra Gentiles (Book I: "God")
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- De Veritate (On Truth)
- Fides et Ratio (referenced in modern Thomist scholarship)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science (Scientia)**
    - Theology possesses a systematic structure, analogous to other sciences, but grounded in **divine revelation**.
    - Its principles are received from God, not discovered by natural reason alone.
    - Theology uses **reason** to clarify, defend, and expound upon revealed truths.
    - It is a **subalternated science**, dependent on the knowledge God has of Himself.
    - "This doctrine is a science because it proceeds from principles established by the light of a higher science." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.2)

2. **Primacy of Divine Revelation**
    - The content of theology is given by **revelation**, not constructed by human speculation.
    - Scripture and apostolic tradition are the primary sources for theological knowledge.
    - Reason serves revelation but cannot replace or override it.
    - The mysteries of faith surpass what unaided reason can attain.
    - "Other sciences derive their certitude from the natural light of human reason, which can err; whereas this derives its certitude from the light of divine knowledge, which cannot be misled." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.5)

3. **Faith Seeking Understanding**
    - Theology is an exercise of **faith seeking understanding** (fides quaerens intellectum).
    - Faith provides the foundation; reason seeks to understand and articulate what is believed.
    - Theological inquiry deepens the believer’s grasp of revealed truths.
    - The ultimate goal is to lead to **contemplation of God**.
    - "Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth." (Summa Contra Gentiles I, 9)

4. **Integration of Philosophy and Theology**
    - Philosophy is a handmaiden to theology, providing conceptual tools and clarity.
    - Natural reason can demonstrate certain truths about God (e.g., His existence).
    - Philosophy cannot attain the mysteries of faith (e.g., the Trinity) without revelation.
    - The proper use of philosophy strengthens, rather than threatens, theological understanding.
    - "Philosophy is the handmaid of theology." (Commentary on Boethius’ De Trinitate, q.5, a.1)

5. **The End of Theology: Beatific Vision**
    - The ultimate purpose of theology is to direct humans to **union with God**.
    - Knowledge of God in this life is preparatory for the **beatific vision** in the next.
    - Theology shapes both intellect and will toward their supernatural end.
    - Theological study is thus both speculative and practical, aiming at salvation.
    - "Theology teaches about God, and all things in relation to God, as their beginning and end." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s conception of **theology as a science grounded in revelation** became foundational for later Catholic and much of Western Christian thought. His synthesis of **faith and reason** shaped scholastic methodology and influenced Protestant and Catholic theologians alike. The enduring relevance of his approach is evident in ongoing discussions about the relationship between **revelation, reason, and the task of theology**. Aquinas remains a central figure in debates over the epistemological foundations and ultimate aims of theological inquiry.
