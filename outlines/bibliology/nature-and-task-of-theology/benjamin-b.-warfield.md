# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield championed a rigorous, scientific approach to the **nature and task of theology**, insisting that theology is the systematic exposition of **divine revelation** found in **Scripture**. He viewed theology as both a science and a discipline of faith, aiming to articulate the truths of **Christian doctrine** in a coherent and intellectually responsible manner.

- "Theology is the science of God and of the relations between God and the universe." (Revelation and Inspiration)

## Key Works

- Revelation and Inspiration
- The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible
- The Plan of Salvation
- Selected Shorter Writings (esp. essays on theological method)
- Calvin and Calvinism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science**
    - Theology is a disciplined, methodical study grounded in **objective revelation**.
    - It seeks to discover and systematize the truths God has revealed in Scripture.
    - Warfield rejected subjectivism, emphasizing theology’s basis in **historical facts** and **divine acts**.
    - He insisted theology must be pursued with intellectual rigor akin to other sciences.
    - "Theology is a science, not because it is a mere human speculation, but because it deals with facts and seeks to systematize them." (Revelation and Inspiration)

2. **Primacy of Divine Revelation**
    - All theological knowledge depends on God’s self-disclosure in **Scripture**.
    - Warfield denied that theology could be constructed from natural reason alone.
    - He argued that **special revelation** is necessary for true knowledge of God.
    - The Bible is the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
    - "The task of theology is to ascertain, to systematize, and to exhibit the facts of divine revelation." (The Idea of Systematic Theology)

3. **Systematic Character of Theology**
    - Theology must organize biblical data into a coherent system.
    - Warfield emphasized the unity and internal consistency of **Christian doctrine**.
    - He saw systematic theology as the culmination of exegetical and historical studies.
    - Theological formulation should reflect the totality of biblical teaching.
    - "Systematic theology is that part of theological science which aims to present in a systematic form the whole body of truth revealed in the Scriptures." (The Idea of Systematic Theology)

4. **Theologian’s Posture: Faith Seeking Understanding**
    - Warfield held that theology is done from a standpoint of **faith** in God’s revelation.
    - The theologian must submit to the authority of Scripture, not stand above it.
    - He affirmed the necessity of spiritual illumination by the Holy Spirit.
    - Intellectual humility and reverence are essential for theological work.
    - "Theology is the science of God, prosecuted by those who know Him, for the benefit of those who know Him." (The Idea of Systematic Theology)

5. **Apologetic and Polemical Task**
    - Warfield saw theology as inherently apologetic, defending the faith against error.
    - He engaged contemporary challenges to **biblical authority** and **orthodoxy**.
    - Theology must respond to modern skepticism and uphold the truth of revelation.
    - He viewed polemics as a necessary aspect of maintaining doctrinal purity.
    - "The theologian must be prepared to defend the truth as well as to expound it." (Selected Shorter Writings)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s vision of theology as a **scientific discipline** grounded in divine revelation shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially in the American Presbyterian tradition. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the necessity of systematic coherence remains foundational for confessional theology. Warfield’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between faith, reason, and revelation, and his methodological rigor continues to influence evangelical scholarship.
