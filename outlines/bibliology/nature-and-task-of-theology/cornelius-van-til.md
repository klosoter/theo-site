# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til understood the **nature and task of theology** as the disciplined, confessional articulation of **revelation** within the context of the **Creator-creature distinction**. He insisted that all theological reflection must be grounded in **Scripture** as the self-attesting Word of God and interpreted through a **Reformed, presuppositional epistemology**.

- "Christian theology is therefore a system of truth resting upon the authority of God as he speaks in Scripture." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Apologetics
- A Christian Theory of Knowledge
- The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology is analogical and revelational**
    - Human knowledge of God is always analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - Theology depends entirely on God's **self-revelation** in Scripture.
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** is foundational for all theological method.
    - Theological statements must reflect the distinction between God's knowledge and ours.
    - "All human knowledge is analogical of the divine knowledge." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Presuppositional epistemology**
    - All reasoning is governed by basic presuppositions, either for or against God.
    - Theological method must presuppose the truth of **Scripture**.
    - Neutrality in theology is impossible; all thought is covenantally committed.
    - Apologetics and theology are inseparable, both grounded in the authority of God’s revelation.
    - "There is no position of epistemological neutrality." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Systematic theology as a unified discipline**
    - Theology must present the teachings of Scripture as a coherent, unified system.
    - The **Reformed confessions** provide a faithful summary of biblical doctrine.
    - Doctrinal loci are interdependent and must be studied in relation to the whole.
    - Systematic theology is both descriptive (of revelation) and constructive (for the church).
    - "Christian theology is a system because God is a self-consistent being." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought**
    - There is a fundamental opposition between **covenantal** and non-covenantal thinking.
    - Theology must expose and challenge the autonomy of human reason.
    - The **noetic effects of sin** distort all non-Christian theological efforts.
    - Apologetic engagement is part of the theologian’s task.
    - "There is no common ground except that which God has established." (Christian Apologetics)

5. **Theology serves the church and its witness**
    - Theological reflection is for the edification and defense of the church.
    - The theologian’s task is to equip believers to think and live covenantally.
    - Theology must be pastoral, not merely academic or speculative.
    - The church’s confession shapes and is shaped by its theology.
    - "Theology is the servant of the church, not its master." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **nature and task of theology** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in the areas of **presuppositional apologetics** and the doctrine of revelation. His insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the analogical character of all human knowledge of God has influenced generations of theologians and apologists. While some have critiqued his method as overly rigid, his legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on the confessional and revelational foundations of theology within the Reformed tradition.
