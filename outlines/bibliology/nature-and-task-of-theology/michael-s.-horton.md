# Michael Horton (1964–)

Michael Horton approaches the **nature and task of theology** as the disciplined reflection on **God’s self-revelation** in **Scripture**, undertaken within the **covenantal** and **ecclesial** context for the sake of the church’s faith and witness. He emphasizes the distinction between **theologia archetypa** (God’s own knowledge) and **theologia ectypa** (human participation in that knowledge), insisting that theology is both a **scientia** (science) and a **sapientia** (wisdom) oriented toward the **means of grace**.

- "Theology is not speculation about God, but a disciplined reflection on what God has revealed about himself in the covenant of grace." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way
- Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples
- Covenant and Eschatology: The Divine Drama
- People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology
- God of Promise: Introducing Covenant Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Foundation of Theology**
    - Theology begins with **God’s self-disclosure** in Scripture, not human speculation.
    - The **Word of God** is the norming norm for all theological reflection.
    - Revelation is both **historical** and **redemptive**, centered in Christ.
    - The church receives, not invents, its doctrine from divine revelation.
    - "Theology is possible only because God has spoken, and it is faithful only when it listens." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Distinction Between Archetypal and Ectypal Theology**
    - God alone possesses **archetypal theology**—perfect, comprehensive knowledge of himself.
    - Humans participate in **ectypal theology**, a finite and analogical knowledge.
    - This distinction guards against **rationalism** and **mysticism** alike.
    - Theological humility is required, recognizing the limits of human understanding.
    - "We know God truly, but never as God knows himself." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Theology as Both Science and Wisdom**
    - Theology is a **scientia**: a disciplined, ordered study of God’s revelation.
    - It is also **sapientia**: wisdom for living before God and neighbor.
    - Theological method involves both **cognitive** and **practical** dimensions.
    - The end of theology is **doxology**—the worship of God.
    - "Theology is not only about knowing but about being transformed by what is known." (Pilgrim Theology)

4. **Covenantal and Ecclesial Context of Theology**
    - Theology is undertaken within the **covenant community** of the church.
    - The **means of grace** (Word and sacrament) are central to theological formation.
    - The church’s confession shapes and is shaped by its theology.
    - Theology serves the church’s mission and discipleship.
    - "Theology is churchly, not merely academic; it is for the people of God." (People and Place)

5. **The Task of Theology: Service to the Church and World**
    - Theology equips the church for **proclamation**, **catechesis**, and **apologetics**.
    - It clarifies the **gospel** and guards against error.
    - Theologians are called to serve, not dominate, the church.
    - Theology addresses contemporary questions in light of the **historic faith**.
    - "The task of theology is to serve the ministry of the Word for the life of the world." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Horton has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by recovering the centrality of **covenant** and the church’s confessional identity. His work has influenced both academic and ecclesial contexts, emphasizing the necessity of grounding theology in **Scripture** and the life of the church. Horton’s insistence on the distinction between God’s knowledge and human knowledge has fostered theological humility and clarity. His contributions continue to inform debates on the **nature and task of theology** within the broader evangelical and Reformed traditions.
