# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the **nature and task of theology** as a discipline rooted in the **self-revelation of God** in Scripture, insisting that theology is both a scientific and spiritual endeavor. He emphasized that **systematic theology** must be grounded in exegesis, governed by the unity of **biblical revelation**, and oriented toward the **edification of the church**.

- "Theology is concerned with the knowledge of God derived from his self-revelation, and it must ever be governed by the data which God himself has given." ("Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 4")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as the Science of God’s Revelation**
    - Theology is a disciplined study of **God’s self-disclosure** in Scripture.
    - It seeks to articulate the content of **divine revelation** systematically.
    - The task is not speculative but grounded in what God has made known.
    - The theologian’s role is to be a faithful interpreter, not an innovator.
    - "Theology is a science that derives its material from the revelation God has given." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 4")

2. **Primacy of Scripture**
    - Scripture is the **sole, infallible source** and norm of theology.
    - All theological formulations must be tested by the teaching of Scripture.
    - The unity and coherence of biblical revelation are foundational.
    - Exegesis is the starting point for all theological reflection.
    - "The Bible is the only source and norm of theology." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 4")

3. **Systematic Theology’s Task**
    - Systematic theology organizes and synthesizes biblical truth.
    - Its aim is to present the **whole counsel of God** in a coherent manner.
    - It must avoid both atomism and artificial system-building.
    - Theological construction is always provisional and reformable.
    - "Systematic theology seeks to exhibit the organic unity of the truth revealed in Scripture." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 4")

4. **Theology in Service to the Church**
    - Theology is for the **edification and instruction** of the church.
    - It must address the needs and questions of God’s people.
    - Theological work is a spiritual exercise, requiring humility and dependence on the Spirit.
    - The end of theology is doxology and obedience.
    - "Theology must ever be pursued in the fear of God and for the glory of his name." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 4")

5. **Integration of Exegesis and Doctrine**
    - Doctrine must arise from careful, contextual exegesis.
    - There is a necessary interplay between biblical theology and systematic theology.
    - Theological formulations must be continually tested by Scripture.
    - The unity of truth demands coherence between exegesis and system.
    - "Doctrine must be the fruit of exegesis, and exegesis must be informed by the totality of biblical teaching." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 4")

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s approach to the **nature and task of theology** has profoundly shaped Reformed theological method, especially in its insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the organic unity of biblical truth. His careful integration of exegesis and systematics set a standard for theological rigor at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. Murray’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to theology as a churchly, doxological, and biblically grounded discipline.
