# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the **nature and task of theology** by grounding it in the self-consciousness of the Christian community and the experience of **religious feeling**. He rejected traditional **propositional revelation** models, emphasizing theology as the systematic articulation of the **feeling of absolute dependence** and the communal life of faith.

- "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as the Science of Christian Experience**
    - Theology systematizes the religious self-consciousness of the Christian community.
    - It is not a speculative or philosophical discipline, but rooted in lived faith.
    - Theological statements express the communal experience of **God-consciousness**.
    - Doctrine arises from the interpretation of religious feeling, not external authority.
    - "Dogmatics is the science which presents the Christian religious affections in their dependence on the Christian faith." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Primacy of Religious Feeling**
    - The essence of religion is the feeling of absolute dependence on God.
    - Theology must begin with the inner experience, not rational proofs or moral law.
    - Religious feeling is universal, but Christian theology articulates its distinct form.
    - Doctrine is secondary to the immediate intuition of the divine.
    - "Religion’s essence is neither thinking nor acting, but intuition and feeling." (On Religion)

3. **Doctrine as Expression, Not Proposition**
    - Doctrines are descriptive accounts of religious experience, not metaphysical truths.
    - Theological language is expressive, not speculative or dogmatic in the traditional sense.
    - The value of doctrine lies in its ability to communicate the communal faith.
    - Theology must avoid reducing doctrine to abstract propositions.
    - "Doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Hermeneutics and Historical Consciousness**
    - Theology requires careful interpretation of religious texts and traditions.
    - Understanding is shaped by the interpreter’s context and the community’s history.
    - Hermeneutics is central to the theological task, bridging past and present.
    - Theological method is dynamic, not static, adapting to new contexts.
    - "Every utterance is to be understood at first and at all times only in the context of the whole." (Hermeneutics and Criticism)

5. **Theology’s Practical and Mediating Role**
    - Theology serves the church by clarifying and articulating its faith.
    - It mediates between the Christian community and broader culture.
    - Theologians must address both the needs of the church and the challenges of modernity.
    - Theology is both descriptive (of faith) and normative (for practice).
    - "Theology is a positive science, having its roots in the life of the Christian Church." (Brief Outline of the Study of Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s redefinition of **theology as the science of religious experience** profoundly shaped modern Protestant thought, especially in the fields of **liberal theology** and hermeneutics. His emphasis on the communal and experiential dimensions of faith challenged traditional dogmatic approaches and paved the way for later developments in existential and practical theology. While criticized by confessional theologians for subjectivism, his influence endures in contemporary discussions of the **nature and method of theology**. Schleiermacher remains a pivotal figure in the transition from classical to modern theology.
