# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann conceives the **nature and task of theology** as an eschatological, public, and transformative discipline, grounded in the **doctrine of hope** and oriented toward the **coming Kingdom of God**. He insists that theology must critically engage with the world’s suffering and anticipate God’s redemptive future, making it both a discipline of reflection and active participation in God’s purposes.

- "Theology, if it is to be Christian theology, must be open to the future of the God of hope." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Church in the Power of the Spirit (1975)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as Eschatological**
    - Theology is fundamentally oriented toward the **future** and the promises of God.
    - The **resurrection of Christ** is the ground for hope and theological reflection.
    - Eschatology is not a separate doctrine but the horizon of all theological work.
    - Theologians are called to interpret reality in light of the **coming Kingdom**.
    - "From first to last, and not merely in the epilogue, Christianity is eschatology." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Theology Engaged with the World**
    - Theology must address the realities of **suffering, injustice, and oppression**.
    - The task of theology is public, not confined to the church or academy.
    - Theologians are responsible for speaking into social and political contexts.
    - Theological reflection should inspire **praxis** that anticipates God’s future.
    - "The church must always be open to the world, and theology must always be open to the questions of the world." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

3. **Theology as Critique and Transformation**
    - Theology critiques both church and society in light of the **gospel**.
    - It seeks the transformation of existing realities, not mere description.
    - Theological method involves both **memory** (of God’s acts) and anticipation (of God’s future).
    - Theologians must challenge ideologies that resist the liberating work of God.
    - "Theology is not only a reflection on the gospel, but also a critique of the world in the light of the gospel." (Experiences in Theology)

4. **Theology in Dialogue**
    - Theology must be dialogical, engaging with other disciplines and worldviews.
    - Openness to **science, philosophy, and interreligious dialogue** is essential.
    - Theological truth emerges in conversation, not isolation.
    - The church’s witness is enriched by listening to the world’s questions and insights.
    - "Theology must be open to the world and to the sciences, and must learn from them." (Experiences in Theology)

5. **Hope as the Heart of Theology**
    - **Hope** is the central category for understanding Christian faith and theology.
    - The promises of God shape both theological method and content.
    - Hope motivates theological engagement with present realities.
    - The church is a community of hope, witnessing to the coming **new creation**.
    - "Hope finds in Christ not only a consolation in suffering, but also the protest of the divine against suffering." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s vision of **eschatological theology** has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions on the purpose and method of theology, especially within **public theology** and liberationist movements. His insistence on hope, dialogue, and engagement with the world has challenged theologians to move beyond abstract speculation toward transformative praxis. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire those seeking a theology that is both faithful to the gospel and responsive to the world’s deepest needs.
