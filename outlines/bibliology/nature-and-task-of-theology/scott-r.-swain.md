# Scott R. Swain (1974– )

Scott R. Swain approaches the **nature and task of theology** as a disciplined reflection on **God’s self-revelation** in **Scripture**, undertaken within the context of the **church** and oriented toward the knowledge and worship of the **triune God**. He emphasizes theology’s role as a **scientia**—a science ordered by God’s Word—while maintaining its inherently **doctrinal** and **ecclesial** character.

- "Christian theology is the church’s disciplined attempt to know the God of the gospel according to his Word." ("The Trinity and the Bible," 2021)

## Key Works

- The Trinity: An Introduction (2020)
- The God of the Gospel: Robert Jenson’s Trinitarian Theology (2013)
- "Theology as a Discipline of the Church" (in Reformed Catholicity, 2015, with Michael Allen)
- "Dogmatic Theology and the Task of the Church" (various essays)
- "The Trinity and the Bible: On Theological Interpretation" (2021)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Churchly Science**
    - Theology is a **scientia**: a rational discipline ordered by divine revelation.
    - It is conducted within and for the **church**, not merely the academy.
    - The church’s confession shapes the boundaries and aims of theology.
    - Theological method is accountable to the **rule of faith**.
    - "Theology is a churchly science, ordered by the gospel and practiced in service to the church’s confession." (Reformed Catholicity)

2. **Primacy of Divine Revelation**
    - Theology depends entirely on **God’s self-disclosure** in Scripture.
    - Human reason is ministerial, not magisterial, in theological reflection.
    - The **canon** of Scripture is the norming norm for all doctrine.
    - The **Spirit’s illumination** is necessary for right understanding.
    - "Theology is a response to God’s address, not an autonomous human project." (The Trinity: An Introduction)

3. **Trinitarian Orientation**
    - The **triune God** is both the source and object of theology.
    - All theological loci are ultimately ordered to the doctrine of the Trinity.
    - The **economy of salvation** reveals the immanent Trinity.
    - Worship and knowledge of God are inseparable in theological practice.
    - "Theology is the pursuit of wisdom concerning the triune God and all things in relation to him." (The Trinity: An Introduction)

4. **Doctrinal and Dogmatic Character**
    - Theology is fundamentally **dogmatic**, seeking to articulate the church’s faith.
    - Doctrinal formulations serve the church’s worship and witness.
    - The **creeds and confessions** provide a framework for faithful theology.
    - Theological development is a communal, traditioned enterprise.
    - "Dogmatics is the disciplined articulation of the church’s confession in light of God’s Word." (Reformed Catholicity)

5. **Theological Interpretation of Scripture**
    - Scripture is to be read as **Holy Scripture**, centered on Christ.
    - The **rule of faith** guides exegesis and interpretation.
    - The unity of Scripture is both presupposed and sought in theology.
    - Theological interpretation is attentive to both the letter and the spirit.
    - "The Bible is the church’s book, to be read in the context of its confession and worship." (The Trinity and the Bible)

## Legacy and Impact

Scott R. Swain has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed dogmatics** by articulating a vision of theology that is both rigorously **confessional** and deeply ecclesial. His work has contributed to renewed interest in the **doctrine of the Trinity** and the practice of **theological interpretation of Scripture**. Swain’s emphasis on theology as a churchly discipline has influenced a new generation of theologians seeking to integrate academic rigor with ecclesial fidelity.
