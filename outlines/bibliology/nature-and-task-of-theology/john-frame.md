# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame’s approach to the **nature and task of theology** is marked by his emphasis on **theology as the application of Scripture to all areas of life**. He is known for his **multiperspectivalism**, which insists that theological reflection must account for the **normative, situational, and existential perspectives**. Frame sees theology as inherently practical, aiming to equip believers for faithful obedience to God.

- "Theology is the application of the Word of God by persons to all areas of life." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- John Frame’s Selected Shorter Writings (2 vols., 2014–2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as Application**
    - Theology is not merely theoretical but is meant for practical obedience.
    - Theological reflection must address real-life situations and decisions.
    - The task of theology is to bring the **Word of God** to bear on every aspect of human existence.
    - Theology serves the church by guiding faithful living.
    - "Theology is a practical discipline, not merely an academic one." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

2. **Multiperspectivalism**
    - Every theological issue can be approached from **normative** (Scripture), **situational** (context), and **existential** (person) perspectives.
    - No single perspective is sufficient; all three are necessary for a full understanding.
    - This framework guards against reductionism in theological method.
    - Multiperspectivalism reflects the complexity of God’s revelation and human experience.
    - "We need all three perspectives to understand anything as God would have us understand it." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

3. **Primacy of Scripture**
    - Scripture is the **normative** standard for all theological reflection.
    - The authority of the Bible is foundational for the task of theology.
    - Theology must always be rooted in exegesis and faithful interpretation.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture guides both doctrine and practice.
    - "God’s Word is the ultimate criterion of truth in theology." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

4. **Integration of Doctrine and Life**
    - Doctrine is inseparable from Christian living and worship.
    - Theology must address both belief and practice in the life of the church.
    - Theological knowledge is for the purpose of transformation and service.
    - The unity of doctrine and life reflects the biblical pattern.
    - "Theology is for living: it is meant to be practiced, not just contemplated." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Theologian’s Responsibility**
    - The theologian is called to serve the church, not just the academy.
    - Humility and dependence on the Holy Spirit are essential in theological work.
    - Theologians must be attentive to the needs and questions of God’s people.
    - Theological method must foster love for God and neighbor.
    - "The theologian is a servant of Christ and his people." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s **multiperspectival approach** has significantly influenced contemporary Reformed theology, especially in the areas of theological method and epistemology. His insistence on the practical nature of theology has encouraged a generation of theologians and pastors to see doctrine as inseparable from life and ministry. Frame’s work continues to shape discussions on the authority of Scripture, the integration of faith and practice, and the calling of the theologian within the church.
