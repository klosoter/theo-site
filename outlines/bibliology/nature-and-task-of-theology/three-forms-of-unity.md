# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the **Belgic Confession**, **Heidelberg Catechism**, and **Canons of Dort**—articulate a confessional Reformed understanding of the **nature and task of theology**. These documents emphasize that theology is the disciplined exposition of **Scripture** for the glory of God, the edification of the church, and the defense of the faith. They stress the necessity of **doctrinal clarity**, the centrality of **covenant theology**, and the church’s role as the pillar and ground of truth.

- "We believe that those Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 2–7, 27–32
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 19, 21, 54, 65–68
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially the Rejection of Errors and Conclusion
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- The Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sole and Sufficient Authority**
    - Scripture is the only **infallible rule** for faith and life.
    - All doctrines must be tested by the clear teaching of **God’s Word**.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture excludes human traditions as binding.
    - The church is called to submit to and proclaim the whole counsel of God revealed in Scripture.
    - "We reject with all our hearts whatsoever doth not agree with this infallible rule." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

2. **Theology as Ecclesial and Confessional**
    - Theology is not a private endeavor but is rooted in the **confession of the church**.
    - The church is the context in which doctrine is taught, confessed, and defended.
    - Confessions serve to unify the church in truth and guard against error.
    - The task of theology includes catechesis, worship, and discipline.
    - "Out of the assembly of the true Christian believers there is no salvation." (Belgic Confession, Art. 28)

3. **Theology Oriented to the Glory of God**
    - The chief end of theology is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.
    - All theological reflection must begin and end with the **majesty and sovereignty of God**.
    - The doctrines of grace (election, atonement, perseverance) are expounded for God’s honor.
    - The church’s worship and confession are directed toward God’s praise.
    - "That we may rightly know God, our only comfort in life and death." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 1)

4. **Covenantal Structure of Doctrine**
    - The unity of **redemptive history** is structured by God’s covenant dealings.
    - Theology explains the relationship between God and His people through the covenants.
    - The sacraments are signs and seals of the covenant of grace.
    - The covenant frames the church’s identity and mission.
    - "God is pleased to communicate Himself unto us by means of covenants." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 74)

5. **Theology as Pastoral and Practical**
    - Theological truth is intended for the **comfort, assurance, and sanctification** of believers.
    - Doctrine is applied to the heart and life through preaching, catechesis, and discipline.
    - The knowledge of God leads to gratitude, obedience, and hope.
    - The church’s teaching office is responsible for guiding believers in truth and godliness.
    - "True faith is not only a certain knowledge, but also a hearty trust." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 21)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have shaped the identity and mission of Reformed churches worldwide, providing a robust confessional standard for the **nature and task of theology**. Their emphasis on **Scripture**, covenant, and the church’s teaching office continues to inform Reformed theological method and ecclesial practice. These documents remain foundational for catechesis, doctrinal formulation, and ecumenical dialogue, ensuring that theology serves both the glory of God and the edification of His people.
