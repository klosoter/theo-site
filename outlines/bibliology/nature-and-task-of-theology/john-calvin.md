# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin understood the **nature and task of theology** as the disciplined study of **God** and his **self-revelation** in **Scripture**, always oriented toward the **knowledge of God and of ourselves**. For Calvin, theology is both **speculative** and **practical**, aiming not only at right doctrine but at the transformation of life and worship. The theologian’s task is to interpret **Scripture** faithfully, under the guidance of the **Holy Spirit**, for the edification of the **church**.

- "Nearly all the wisdom we possess, that is to say, true and sound wisdom, consists of two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves." (Institutes I.1.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I)
- Commentaries on the Bible (various prefaces and introductions)
- The Necessity of Reforming the Church
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology is the knowledge of God and of ourselves**
    - True theology begins with the recognition of God’s majesty and our own dependence.
    - The double knowledge is foundational: knowing God reveals our sin and need; knowing ourselves drives us to God.
    - This knowledge is not speculative but leads to reverence and obedience.
    - Theological reflection is inseparable from piety.
    - "Without knowledge of self there is no knowledge of God." (Institutes I.1.2)

2. **Scripture as the sole foundation of theology**
    - Theology must be grounded in the **Word of God** as the only sure and clear revelation.
    - The authority of Scripture is self-authenticating, confirmed by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - All theological claims are to be tested by Scripture.
    - The theologian’s task is exegesis, not speculation beyond what is revealed.
    - "The Scriptures obtain full authority among believers only when men regard them as having sprung from heaven." (Institutes I.7.1)

3. **Theology is both speculative and practical**
    - True doctrine is inseparable from godly living.
    - The purpose of theology is not mere knowledge, but transformation and worship.
    - Theology must serve the **edification of the church**.
    - Theological study is always oriented toward the glory of God and the good of neighbor.
    - "It is not enough to have knowledge of God, unless that knowledge also moves us to worship and obedience." (Institutes I.2.2)

4. **The necessity of the Holy Spirit for true understanding**
    - Human reason is insufficient to grasp divine truth apart from the Spirit’s illumination.
    - The Spirit testifies to the truth of Scripture in the hearts of believers.
    - Theologians must pray for and depend on the Spirit’s guidance.
    - The Spirit unites knowledge with faith and piety.
    - "The testimony of the Spirit is more excellent than all reason." (Institutes I.7.4)

5. **Theology is for the church**
    - Theological work is not a private endeavor but serves the community of faith.
    - Doctrine must be communicated clearly for the instruction and comfort of believers.
    - The unity and purity of the church depend on sound teaching.
    - The theologian is a servant of the Word for the sake of the people of God.
    - "For the task of the theologian is not to amuse himself with empty speculation, but to build up the church in true doctrine." (cf. Institutes IV.1.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s vision of **theology** as the pursuit of the **knowledge of God** through **Scripture** has profoundly shaped the **Reformed tradition** and the practice of systematic theology. His insistence on the inseparability of doctrine and piety, and the centrality of the **Holy Spirit** in theological understanding, remains foundational for Reformed theological method. Calvin’s approach continues to influence both academic theology and the life of the church, emphasizing that all theological reflection must serve the glory of God and the edification of his people.
