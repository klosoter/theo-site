### ESSAY
The nature and task of theology turns on one fundamental question: can creatures possess a genuine **science of God**, and if so, of what sort, on what basis, and to what end. To answer, one must hold together two poles without collapse. On the one hand, God is the simple, triune Lord, whose essence is infinitely above the creature, such that in himself he is known only to himself. On the other hand, God has spoken, making himself known in the economy of creation and redemption, supremely in Jesus Christ, and inscribing that self-revelation in Holy Scripture. The nature of theology, if it is to be Christian at all, is determined not by our religious consciousness or by the structures of human inquiry in general, but by this movement of **revelation** from the triune God to his people, and the corresponding, Spirit-given movement of the church’s responsive knowledge.

Augustine is decisive because he articulates with unique clarity that theology is participation in God’s own self-knowledge, yet under the conditions of creatureliness. In De Trinitate he insists that God alone knows himself perfectly, but that believers, united to Christ and indwelt by the Spirit, are drawn into a graced contemplation of God according to the “rule of faith” grounded in Scripture. For Augustine, theology is not an autonomous discipline but the ordered exercise of **faith seeking understanding**. It rests on the authority of the divine speaker, received in faith, then pursued intellectually in order to delight in God and to direct the church’s life. Theology is thus both **scientia** and **sapientia**. Scientia refers to the structured understanding of revealed truths, their interconnections, and their rational fittingness. Sapientia is the higher wisdom that tastes and loves the God of whom one thus thinks and speaks. Augustine never allows these to be separated. When examiners press, for example, “Is theology theoretical or practical; is it contemplative or ecclesial and moral,” Augustine’s answer is both: theology is a contemplation of God that is inseparable from the reordering of the soul and the church toward God.

Augustine’s method underscores several enduring anchors. First, the primacy of Scripture as the norming norm. His De doctrina christiana is not a manual of neutral hermeneutics but a theological account of how the church reads Scripture in love of God and neighbor, under the regula fidei. Second, **analogical knowledge**. Augustine insists God’s greatness exceeds all our conceptions; yet, because we are made in the image of God and because God has accommodated himself in Scripture and the Word made flesh, our speech about God, though never comprehensive, is genuinely true. Third, the intrinsically trinitarian shape of theology. God is the author, content, and end of theology, and God is irreducibly Father, Son, and Spirit. These elements provide the infrastructure for later medieval and Reformation accounts of theology’s nature.

Thomas Aquinas takes this Augustinian heritage and forges the classic Latin account of theology as **sacra doctrina**, a genuine **scientia** but one whose principle is not human but divine. In Summa theologiae I.1 Aquinas asks whether sacra doctrina is a science and in what way. He famously answers that theology is a science “according to the mode of a subalternated science.” Ordinary sciences derive their first principles from natural reason or observation. Theology derives its principles from the knowledge God has of himself and all things. We know theology’s principles “by way of revelation received in faith,” but the science itself is seated first in God’s own intellect. This is decisive: theology is not the organization of human religious experience but a participation, through revelation, in the luminous order of the divine self-knowledge. Hence Aquinas’s insistence that theology is both speculative and practical, ordered to beatific vision but conducted under the present economy in the church.

For Aquinas, the object of theology is God under the aspect of God, yet known in relation to creatures. This is why later Reformed scholastics will speak of theology as **theologia archetypa** and **theologia ectypa**. Archetypal theology is God’s own, simple self-knowledge. Ectypal theology is the finite, accommodated replica of that knowledge communicated to creatures by revelation. By construing sacra doctrina as God’s own discourse accommodated to us, Aquinas safeguards two truths examiners will probe. First, theology is irreducibly revelational and thus surpasses reason, yet it is not irrational. It uses reason ministerially to show the non-contradiction and congruity of revealed mysteries. Second, theology is principally about God in himself, not only about God’s relation to us. Yet the only access we have to God in himself is precisely through his works and words ad extra. Aquinas’s vigorous defense of **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **immutability** thus informs not only his doctrine of God but his account of theology’s very possibility: if God were not simple, his own self-knowledge would be composite and developing, incapable of grounding a stable, communicable science; and if revelation were not accommodated according to an **analogical** proportion, we would either project creaturely properties univocally onto God or despair of any true knowledge.

Within the medieval tradition, there are internal debates. Some emphasize theology’s practical character, others its speculative nature. Some, like Bonaventure, lean more into Augustinian illumination and the journey of the soul into God; others, like later nominalists, fracture the unity of God’s nature and will and so destabilize theology’s metaphysical anchor. These internal shifts matter: the late medieval voluntarist trajectory loosens the tie between God’s being and his revealed will, opening conceptual space for modern notions of revelation as sheer external command or as historical-event without stable doctrinal content. In an exam setting, one must show how this affects theological method. If the divine will is conceived as sheer, contingent fiat, then Scripture can be read as an aggregate of arbitrary decrees, and theology devolves into external law or narrative report, rather than participation in a coherent divine wisdom.

The Reformation, and especially John Calvin, does not overthrow the basic idea of theology as **scientia Dei**, but reconfigures its mode and setting in light of Scripture’s clarity and the crisis of ecclesial authority. Calvin’s Institutes are not a speculative summa but a “sum of piety,” designed to train believers in a knowledge of God that is inseparable from worship and obedience. Calvin begins with a famous reciprocity of knowledge: we cannot know God without knowing ourselves, nor know ourselves without being confronted by God. But when he speaks programmatically of theology, he can embrace the scholastic distinction between God as the principal object and the works of God as the material through which we know him. Calvin is deeply Augustinian: theology is grounded in God’s self-revelation, not in rational ascent. Yet he differs from late medieval scholasticism by re-centering theology on Scripture as the immediately norming revelation, under the internal testimony of the Spirit, rather than on an ecclesial magisterium.

For Calvin, the nature of theology is conditioned by the covenantal economy. Theology is not merely an individual wisdom but a **federal** and ecclesial knowledge given to the people of God under the ministry of the word and sacraments. His polemic against the “fanatics” is instructive: any account of theology that sets the inward Spirit against the outward word destroys the nature of theology as a public, communicable science. The Spirit’s work is precisely to bind us to Christ’s word. Hence Calvin’s insistence that all theological speculation that goes beyond Scripture’s scope is dangerous. Examiners will often press: does this mean Calvin rejects the notion of theology as a science with ordered principles and conclusions. The correct answer is no. Calvin uses scholastic distinctions and argues with logical rigor. But he reorders the task: the goal is not an exhaustive system but a scripturally disciplined, Christocentric, pastoral **knowledge of God and of ourselves** that yields reverence, trust, and obedience.

Within the Reformed tradition, this yields its own internal debates about the nature and task of theology. Post-Reformation scholastics such as Polanus, Junius, and Turretin develop highly formal accounts of **theologia archetypa** and **ectypa**, sometimes distinguishing between theology as it exists in God, in the blessed, and in wayfarers. Some stress theology’s status as a “habitus” infused by the Spirit, others as a discipline structured by loci communes derived from Scripture. In the modern period, figures like Bavinck insist that theology must be both scientific and organic, a disciplined system that nevertheless reflects the living unity of revelation in Christ. These debates raise exam questions such as whether systematic theology is the apex of theology or simply one mode alongside biblical, historical, and practical theology. A robust Reformed answer will affirm systematics as the integrating discipline, precisely because theology’s ultimate object is the one simple God, whose works in history are coherent and whose revelation demands a total response.

If Augustine, Thomas, and Calvin anchor a broadly classical and Reformed account of theology as analogical participation in divine self-knowledge through revelation, Friedrich Schleiermacher represents a decisive modern alternative that must be faced squarely. In his Brief Outline of the Study of Theology and The Christian Faith Schleiermacher redefines theology as a positive science ordered to the life of the Christian community. Crucially, he relocates theology’s material center: theology no longer has its formal principle in divine self-revelation given in Scripture but in the Christian religious consciousness, specifically the feeling of absolute dependence. Christ and Scripture remain important, but they function as historical expressions and normative foci of this fundamental religious consciousness. Theology’s task becomes to describe, analyze, and systematize the piety of the evangelical church, vindicating its coherence in relation to modern philosophical and historical consciousness.

Externally, this Schleiermacherian move aligns theology more closely with the emergent disciplines of psychology, phenomenology, and the historical study of religion. Theology becomes a branch of the human sciences, rather than a participation in God’s self-knowledge. Examiners will often ask: is Schleiermacher’s theology still about God at all, or merely about human experience. Schleiermacher would answer that God is known only in and through this consciousness of dependence, and so theology’s access to God is mediated through the structure of piety. But this raises a profound objection from the classical camp: if theology’s principle is the self-consciousness of the subject, then revelation loses its objectivity and normativity. Scripture and Christ can be subordinated to the criteria of what resonates with or arises from religious feeling. The task of theology is no longer to receive and expound what God has spoken, but to articulate the self-understanding of the community under changing conditions.

It is precisely this displacement that Karl Barth contests and in some respects reverses. While historically indebted to Schleiermacher and modern critical theology, Barth insists in Church Dogmatics I.1 that theology is “a science of the Word of God.” By this Barth means something quite specific: theology is the church’s critical and constructive reflection on God’s self-revelation in Jesus Christ as attested in Scripture and proclaimed in the church’s preaching. Theology is therefore churchly, not an abstract philosophy of religion; its norm is the self-attesting Word; its subject is the triune God who speaks. In this sense Barth recovers the older conviction that theology is determined by its object, not by the consciousness of the subject. However, Barth also radicalizes the distance between God and the creature in a way that can trouble a Reformed examiner. He refuses the language of natural theology as a prelude to revealed theology, and he often resists speaking of a stable **ectypal** theology in creatures that analogically participates in God’s archetypal knowledge. For Barth, revelation is act, event, encounter. Theology is thus always provisional, always a human work that must be judged and corrected by the living Christ who speaks through Scripture.

Internally, Barth’s followers debate the relative weight of Christology versus trinitarianism as theology’s organizing center, and whether the economy fully determines the immanent Trinity. From a Reformed standpoint, the challenge to Barth is whether this strong emphasis on event and dialectic jeopardizes theology’s status as a relatively stable **scientia** of God that can be handed on in confessional form. If revelation is God’s free act in the moment, and if Scripture is not itself the Word but only becomes Word, then theology is in danger of collapsing into listening for events rather than expounding a given canon. One must be able to say to an examiner: I can appreciate Barth’s re-centering of theology on God’s speech and Christ’s lordship, but I must qualify it by reasserting the perspicuity and stability of Scripture as revelation and the reality of **analogical knowledge** grounded in **divine simplicity** and the Creator–creature distinction.

These classical and modern trajectories converge in contemporary debates about the nature and task of theology. There are “internal” debates within the broadly orthodox camp about method: is the primary norm the text of Scripture as read in grammatical-historical exegesis, or the church’s rule of faith and confessional tradition, or the liturgical and sacramental life of the church. Biblical theologians may worry that systematicians impose alien philosophical categories; systematicians worry that biblical theologians leave the many-voiced canon disordered. Others emphasize theology’s practical and political dimension, insisting that theology is primarily a discourse of liberation and justice. In response, a WTS-level answer must insist that theology is one discipline with multiple modes, but its formal principle remains God’s own self-attestation in Scripture. Biblical, historical, and practical theology are not competitors but ordered services to the one end: the church’s true knowledge of the triune God in Christ.

Externally, theology now competes with religious studies, philosophy of religion, and cultural theory. Religious studies treats Christian doctrine as one example of human religious behavior, to be explained by sociological or evolutionary accounts. Philosophy of religion often abstracts theism into generic arguments about causation, modality, and possible worlds, detached from the concrete Trinitarian confession. Postmodern theory may deconstruct theology as one more power-laden discourse. In this environment, defending theology’s nature as a genuine **science of God** involves arguing that theology has its own proper object, methods, and norms. It is not less rational because it begins from faith in revelation; rather, like every discipline, it operates with basic commitments that are then explored and tested for coherence and explanatory fruitfulness. The task of theology vis-à-vis philosophy is neither absorption nor hostility, but the use of philosophy as an ancilla, subject to Scripture and the rule of faith, in clarifying and defending what God has spoken.

Contemporary issues also stress-test theology’s task. Questions about contextual and public theology ask whether theology must be tailored to particular cultural and political settings or articulated for the common good in pluralistic societies. Issues in science and technology raise whether theology must reconceive doctrines like creation, providence, and human nature in light of evolution, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. Here the key is to maintain that theology’s primary task is not to baptize contemporary insights nor to ignore them, but to receive them critically and gratefully under the canon of Scripture and in light of **divine simplicity** and **providence**. The doctrine of God, and a right account of **analogical knowledge**, will regulate what counts as a permissible development and what would constitute a capitulation.

What, then, is the position to be defended. Theology is best defined as follows: theology is the **scientia Dei sub creatura**, the Spirit-given, analogical participation of the church in the triune God’s own knowledge of himself and his works, through God’s self-revelation in Christ and Holy Scripture, ordered to the glory of God and the salvation and edification of his people. This definition incorporates the decisive insights of our figures while resisting their deviations. From Augustine it takes the integration of **scientia** and **sapientia**, the primacy of Scripture, and the trinitarian shape of knowledge. From Aquinas it takes the distinction between **archetypal** and **ectypal** theology, the scientific character of theology grounded in God’s own self-knowledge, and the necessity of **analogical predication**. From Calvin and the Reformed it takes the covenantal and ecclesial setting of theology, the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture, and the priority of faith and piety. From Schleiermacher it learns to attend to the concrete life of the church and the historical conditions of reflection, yet rejects the centering of theology in religious consciousness. From Barth it retains the emphasis on God’s lordly freedom to speak and the christological centering of all theology, yet reasserts the settled authority of Scripture and the legitimacy of stable dogmatic formulation.

In defending this position under examination, several objections will arise. One objection: if theology is grounded in revelation and faith, is it really a science at all in a modern sense. The answer is that “science” here signifies a disciplined body of ordered knowledge with principles and conclusions proportioned to its object. Theology has such an order, but its first principles are not discovered; they are received. This does not make theology less rational but differently rational: it uses reason ministerially to explore the content of revelation, test for coherence, and respond to objections. Another objection: does speaking of “participation” in God’s own knowledge blur the Creator–creature distinction. The response is to appeal to **theologia ectypa**. Our participation is analogical and finite. We never know God as God knows God, but we truly know what God has been pleased to reveal of himself.

A further objection will press: does this model leave room for contextual, liberation, or public theology. The answer is that context shapes theology’s questions and applications, not its principial norms. The poor, the oppressed, and the pluralistic public square raise real questions addressed by Scripture. Theology must speak concretely to them. But it must do so as theology, that is, as disciplined exposition of God’s self-revelation, not as a mere echo of cultural or political agendas. Finally, examiners may push: is Scripture the only source of theology. One must distinguish sources from norms. God reveals himself also in creation and providence, and the church’s tradition is a vital medium of understanding. But Scripture alone is the norming norm, because there the triune God has given a canonical, Spirit-breathed witness to Christ that cannot be corrected from outside.

To be ready for oral defense, one must be able to move fluently between these conceptual articulations, historical developments, and live debates, and to do so while maintaining a confessed, integrated stance. Theology is a God-given, God-ordered, God-oriented **science of God**, conducted by forgiven sinners within the covenant community, through humble listening to Scripture and responsible use of reason, always aiming at the church’s growth into the fullness of Christ and the glory of the triune Lord.
