# Richard Muller (1948–)

Richard Muller is a leading scholar of **Reformed orthodoxy** whose work has redefined the understanding of the **nature and task of theology** in the post-Reformation era. He emphasizes the **scholastic method**, the distinction between **theology as habitus and as doctrina**, and the importance of **prolegomena** for systematic theology. Muller's analysis situates theology as both a **scientia** and a practical discipline, rooted in Scripture and oriented toward the service of the church.

- "Theology is not merely a speculative discipline but a practical wisdom ordered to the glory of God and the edification of the church." ("Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics," vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as Scientia and Sapientia**
   - Theology is both a **scientific discipline** (scientia) and a **practical wisdom** (sapientia).
   - The scholastic tradition emphasizes theology's rational coherence and its orientation toward piety.
   - The **object of theology** is God as revealed in Scripture, not God in se.
   - Theological method involves both **intellectual understanding** and spiritual formation.
   - "Theology is a wisdom concerning divine matters, acquired by teaching, directed by right reason, and leading to the glory of God." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

2. **Distinction Between Archetypal and Ectypal Theology**
   - Archetypal theology refers to God's perfect self-knowledge; ectypal theology is the knowledge accommodated to creatures.
   - Human theology is always **ectypal**, dependent on **revelation**.
   - This distinction safeguards the **Creator-creature distinction** in theological method.
   - It undergirds the humility and limits of theological discourse.
   - "Theology as we possess it is always a finite, accommodated knowledge, never the archetype itself." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

3. **Role of Prolegomena**
   - Prolegomena establishes the **principles, method, and sources** of theology.
   - It addresses the nature of **Scripture**, the role of reason, and the definition of theology.
   - Prolegomena is not a neutral starting point but is shaped by theological commitments.
   - It provides the necessary groundwork for systematic theology.
   - "Prolegomena is the necessary foundation for the coherent articulation of Christian doctrine." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

4. **Scripture as the Principium Cognoscendi**
   - Scripture is the **cognitive principle** (principium cognoscendi) of theology.
   - All theological knowledge is normed and governed by **divine revelation** in Scripture.
   - The sufficiency and clarity of Scripture are central to the Reformed scholastic approach.
   - Theological method is expository, drawing doctrine from the biblical text.
   - "The principium cognoscendi externum of theology is the inspired Word of God." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

5. **Theology as Habitus and Doctrina**
   - Theology is both a **habitus** (disposition or habit) and a **doctrina** (body of teaching).
   - The habitus refers to the theologian’s spiritual and intellectual formation.
   - Doctrina refers to the objective content of Christian teaching.
   - The proper task of theology is to unite knowledge and piety for the glory of God.
   - "Theology is a habitus in the soul, formed by the Spirit, and a doctrina, articulated for the church." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Muller's work has profoundly shaped contemporary understanding of **Reformed scholasticism** and the historical development of **systematic theology**. His careful analysis of theological method and terminology has corrected many misconceptions about post-Reformation orthodoxy, emphasizing its continuity with the broader Christian tradition. Muller's scholarship has become foundational for students and scholars seeking to grasp the classical Reformed approach to the **nature and task of theology**.
