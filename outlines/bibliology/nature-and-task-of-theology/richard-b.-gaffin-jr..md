# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the **nature and task of theology** as fundamentally grounded in **redemptive history** and the self-revelation of God in **Scripture**. He emphasizes that theology is both a **scientia** (science) and a **servant of the church**, tasked with articulating the faith in light of **biblical revelation** and the unfolding work of **Christ**.

- "Theology is the church’s reflection on the revelation of God given in Scripture as it is understood and appropriated by faith." (Theology and the Westminster Tradition)

## Key Works

- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (1979)
- "Resurrection and Redemption" (1978)
- "God’s Word in Servant Form" (2008)
- "By Faith, Not by Sight" (2006)
- "The Vitality of Reformed Systematic Theology" (in Westminster Theological Journal, 2002)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology is Redemptive-Historical**
   - Theology must be rooted in the unfolding of **God’s redemptive acts** in history.
   - The **resurrection of Christ** is central to understanding all doctrine.
   - Theological reflection is inseparable from the **progress of revelation**.
   - The unity of **Old and New Testaments** shapes theological method.
   - "The history of revelation is the matrix of all theological understanding." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Scripture as the Norming Norm**
   - **Scripture** is the ultimate authority and source for all theological formulation.
   - The task of theology is to **expound and systematize** what is revealed in the Bible.
   - Theology must always be **subordinate to exegesis**.
   - The **self-attestation** of Scripture is foundational for theological certainty.
   - "Theology is always answerable to the text of Scripture." (God’s Word in Servant Form)

3. **Theology as Churchly and Confessional**
   - Theology serves the **church** and is not a merely academic pursuit.
   - The **confessions** of the church are subordinate standards, guiding theological reflection.
   - Theological work is done in the context of the **communion of saints**.
   - The **Westminster Standards** provide a faithful summary of biblical doctrine.
   - "Theology is an exercise of faith seeking understanding within the community of the redeemed." (The Vitality of Reformed Systematic Theology)

4. **Integration of Biblical and Systematic Theology**
   - **Biblical theology** and **systematic theology** are mutually enriching disciplines.
   - Systematic theology must be informed by the **historical progression** of revelation.
   - There is no sharp divide between the **exegetical** and the **dogmatic**.
   - Theological method requires both **historical sensitivity** and **doctrinal clarity**.
   - "Systematic theology is the necessary outcome of biblical theology." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Theology as a Spiritual Discipline**
   - Theological understanding is dependent on the **illumination of the Holy Spirit**.
   - Theology is not merely intellectual but involves **faith and obedience**.
   - The theologian must be shaped by **prayer** and **piety**.
   - The ultimate goal of theology is the **glory of God** and the **edification of the church**.
   - "True theology is doxological at its core." (Theology and the Westminster Tradition)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **nature and task of theology** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed thought, especially in the areas of **redemptive-historical hermeneutics** and the relationship between **biblical and systematic theology**. His emphasis on the authority of **Scripture** and the centrality of **Christ’s resurrection** continues to influence both academic and ecclesial contexts. Gaffin’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a theology that is both rigorously biblical and deeply confessional.
