# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **nature and task of theology** as a dynamic, responsive discipline rooted in **revelation** and oriented toward the **church**. He emphasized that theology must remain self-critical, continually returning to **Scripture** as its norm, and must avoid both rationalistic systematization and existential subjectivism.

- "Dogmatics is not a system but an ongoing listening to the Word of God." (A Half Century of Theology)

## Key Works

- Studies in Dogmatics (multi-volume series)
- The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth
- Holy Scripture
- Faith and Revelation
- A Half Century of Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as Listening to Revelation**
    - Theology is fundamentally an act of listening to **God’s self-disclosure** in Scripture.
    - The theologian’s task is receptive, not speculative or constructive.
    - **Revelation** is personal and historical, not merely propositional.
    - Theological reflection must be continually corrected by the **Word of God**.
    - "Theology is listening, not speaking; it is receiving, not inventing." (A Half Century of Theology)

2. **Scripture as Normative**
    - **Scripture** is the unique and final authority for theology.
    - All theological formulations are subject to the test of biblical fidelity.
    - The meaning of Scripture is not exhausted by any system or tradition.
    - Theologians must resist the temptation to impose external frameworks on the biblical text.
    - "The normativity of Scripture is not a static given, but a living authority." (Holy Scripture)

3. **Dogmatics in Service of the Church**
    - The purpose of theology is to serve the **church’s confession** and life.
    - Dogmatics is not an abstract science but is ecclesially located.
    - Theological work must be accessible and edifying for the people of God.
    - The unity of the church is fostered by shared engagement with the biblical witness.
    - "Dogmatics is not for the academy alone, but for the church in its pilgrimage." (Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Justification)

4. **Critical Engagement with Tradition**
    - Tradition is valuable but always subordinate to **Scripture**.
    - The theologian must engage critically, not slavishly, with past formulations.
    - Historical theology provides resources and warnings for contemporary reflection.
    - The Reformed tradition is a living heritage, not a closed system.
    - "We must not absolutize our confessions, but continually test them by the Word." (Studies in Dogmatics: The Person of Christ)

5. **Theological Humility and Openness**
    - Theology is provisional and open to correction.
    - The mystery of God resists exhaustive systematization.
    - Theologians must be self-critical and aware of their own limitations.
    - Dialogue with other traditions and disciplines is necessary for growth.
    - "Theology must always be aware of its own limits and the inexhaustibility of the truth it seeks." (A Half Century of Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s approach to the **nature and task of theology** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially through his insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the ongoing, dialogical character of dogmatics. His work encouraged a posture of humility and openness, resisting both rigid confessionalism and theological relativism. Berkouwer’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of **revelation**, ecclesial theology, and the relationship between tradition and biblical authority.
