### ESSAY
Theology, in its nature and task, is the Spirit-enabled, ecclesial science that contemplates and confesses the triune God according to his self-revelation, ordering all things to God under the rule of Scripture for the sake of the church’s worship and witness. Its material object is God and all things in relation to God. Its formal object is God under the aspect in which he makes himself known, the ratio Dei as given in **revelation**. Theology’s **principia** are twofold: the external principium is Holy Scripture as the canonical deposit of revelation; the internal principium is the illumination of the Holy Spirit, by which the church receives and rightly reasons from Scripture. Its method is **analogical knowledge**, neither univocal nor equivocal, grounded in **divine simplicity** and the Creator–creature distinction. Its end is **doxology** and the wise ordering of proclamation, sacraments, and life under God. Described thus, theology is not an aggregate of religious studies, nor a projection of pious consciousness, nor a positivist catalog of biblical facts. It is **sacra doctrina**, a science sub ratione Dei, whose authority derives from the triune speaker and whose rationality is ministerial to the Word of God.

This definition stands upon a trajectory that begins decisively with Augustine, receives rigorous conceptualization in Thomas Aquinas, undergoes radical modern reformulations in Friedrich Schleiermacher and Karl Barth, and is retrieved and reoriented within the Reformed tradition by Herman Bavinck and Cornelius Van Til. These are not mere historical markers; each reframed what counts as theology, and contemporary disputes still orbit their proposals.

Augustine set the grammar. Coming out of the late antique struggle for the church’s mind and life, his De Trinitate and De doctrina christiana forged a vision of Christian wisdom in which the God who speaks orders the mind to himself. For Augustine, theology is faith seeking understanding. Faith is not a probability judgment but the Spirit’s gift that rightly orients the intellect to its object. Scripture is the authoritative school of charity where the church learns to read the world and the soul coram Deo. The rule of faith governs exegesis, and love of God and neighbor regulates application. The Augustinian epistemic posture is marked by illumination and humility: theology receives rather than constructs its norm. At the same time, Augustine is no fideist. His use of reason is ministerial, ordered by the ends of salvation and the confession of God’s perfections. His doctrine of God and of language is analogical before its scholastic codification: naming God participates in divine names that exceed comprehension while truly signifying God. Hence **analogical knowledge** is both demanded by **divine simplicity** and required by grace. The internal debate that Augustine provokes within every later tradition is whether theology’s method can be elaborated without losing its posture of reception. The external debate he catalyzes is whether this posture can sustain theology’s claim to be a science among the sciences. His answer is that theology’s science is grounded in the supreme authority of God’s self-communication, a distinctive but real scientia whose certainty exceeds discursive demonstration because it rests on truth himself.

Aquinas renders this Augustinian grammar architectonic. In the Summa theologiae, **sacra doctrina** is a science whose principles are given by God’s knowledge communicated through revelation. It is a subalternated science, deriving its axioms from a higher science, the divine scientia, rather than from natural reason. The unity of theology is secured by its formal object: all questions are treated sub ratione Dei, so that God himself and creatures ordered to God fall within a single scientific habitus. Natural reason can know God’s existence in a limited way, the so-called preambles of faith, but the essence of God and the economy of salvation require revelation. Aquinas’s accounts of **analogical knowledge** and of **divine simplicity** are decisive for theology’s nature. Because God is simple, uncomposed, pure act, our predicates of God neither mirror creaturely modes univocally nor collapse into mere equivocity; they signify per prius in God and per posterius in creatures. This protects theology from both rationalist domestication and apophatic paralysis. Further, Aquinas’s **nature–grace** relation secures the gratuity of revelation without denying the integrity of nature: grace perfects nature. The internal debate here, especially within Reformed circles, concerns natural theology. Some fear that granting natural knowledge of God smuggles autonomy into theology’s method. Aquinas’s careful ordering averts this. Natural theology supplies ministerial tools and propaedeutic awareness that God is and that he is not like creatures, but it does not found dogmatics. The external debate occurs with the modern claim that only empirical or formal methods yield genuine knowledge. Aquinas’s case is that theology bears its own mode of evidence, analogously to other subalternated sciences, and it is rational to proceed from authoritative testimony when the authority is God.

Schleiermacher detonated that classical vision by relocating theology’s foundation from revealed doctrine to the structure of Christian consciousness. In his Speeches and Christian Faith, doctrine becomes the articulation of the Christian feeling of absolute dependence as it is experienced in the communal life of the church. Theology is an empirical, historical, and practical science that describes and regulates the life of a pious community. Its norm is the essence of Christianity grasped in redemptive experience, not Scripture as an external principium. Scripture functions as a record of the original piety but stands under criticism by the living experience of the church. Schleiermacher’s move was not mere capitulation to subjectivity; it was a strategic bid to secure theology’s place within the modern university by translating its claims into the grammar of consciousness and culture. Yet the cost is real. The material object of theology shrinks from God and all things in relation to God to a descriptive account of the religious self. The formal object shifts from sub ratione Dei to sub ratione ecclesiae as experienced. For examiners, the challenge is whether any robust doctrine of **divine simplicity**, transcendence, or Scripture’s canonicity can be retained once the intentional object of theology is decisively human. The answer is no. Schleiermacher produced a compelling anthropology of piety, but he surrendered **sacra doctrina**. The modern liberal tradition that followed him made correlation with culture the primary task of theology, leaving the church with brilliant descriptions and thin dogma.

Barth’s revolt against this settlement was sweeping. In the Church Dogmatics, theology returns to the posture of hearing. Dogmatics tests the church’s speech by the Word of God. The Word is threefold, revealed, written, and preached. Revelation is God’s act in which he remains Lord; Scripture is witness; proclamation is commissioned echo. Barth’s insistence that God is known only as and when he gives himself situates theology in radical dependence on divine self-presence. He brands **natural theology** a betrayal, fearing that any appeal to creaturely knowledge apart from Christ will domesticize God and elevate autonomous reason. Barth’s famed analogia fidei is a polemical replacement of the **analogia entis**, and his method is Christophany rather than metaphysically anchored simplicity. The internal debate within the Reformed world is acute here. The Reformed orthodox affirmed both general revelation and **analogical knowledge**, all under Scripture’s norm. Barth’s ban on natural theology was a catechetical corrective, but at points it endangers the catholic confidence that the created order, precisely because of **divine simplicity** and providence, witnesses truly to its maker. Externally, Barth successfully shattered Schleiermacher’s subjectivism by making theology answerable to God’s self-speech rather than to religious consciousness. Yet his own doctrine of Scripture as fallible witness and his hesitancy about classical metaphysics risk dislocating the principia theologiae. A Westminster examiner will press whether Barth can secure a stable canon and a determinate dogmatic content without the church finally adjudicating the Word’s identity. The safer route is not to follow Schleiermacher or Barth at this point but to retrieve the principial structure they both destabilized.

Herman Bavinck embodies that retrieval in modern key. His Reformed Dogmatics presents theology as a science whose principle is God’s self-revelation inscripturated and whose subject is God and all things in relation to God. His distinctive contributions are the organic motif and catholicity. Revelation is not a heap of oracles but an organic whole in which God discloses himself in creation, special revelation, and the history of redemption. Scripture is organically inspired, a living unity authored by God through human authors. Theology must therefore be integrative, exegetical, historical, and philosophical under the canon’s authority, exhibiting an internal coherence that mirrors the unity of truth. Bavinck also retrieves the Reformed account of the twofold principium: Scripture externally, Spirit internally. Theologically, this grounds the church’s confidence without surrendering rational accountability. His doctrine of **common grace** and the **antithesis** holds that while the noetic effects of sin create a real conflict of worldviews, God’s preserving grace enables real participation in human learning. This yields an account of theology’s public posture that neither withdraws into biblicist isolation nor dissolves into accommodation. In the internal debate over **natural theology**, Bavinck affirms that general revelation and created order give true, though suppressed, knowledge of God, and he permits a chastened natural theology ministerial to Scripture. In the external debate with positivism, he contends that theology is a science with its own principia, united by its formal object and disciplined by canonical norms.

Cornelius Van Til sharpens these lines with polemical clarity for the Westminster tradition. His basic axiom is the Creator–creature distinction. Because God is self-contained, triune, and simple, all creaturely knowledge is derivative and therefore analogical. There is no neutral ground. The unbeliever interprets facts against the background of autonomy; the believer interprets facts under the authority of the self-attesting Christ of Scripture. For Van Til, theology and apologetics are of a piece: Christian **dogmatics** articulates the system of truth revealed in Scripture, and apologetics shows the impossibility of the contrary by exposing the internal incoherence of non-Christian presuppositions. He is relentless against autonomous **natural theology** while insisting on the reality of general revelation. The resulting position is not obscurantist. Reason is ministerial; circularity is virtuous when it is the circle of the triune God’s self-attestation; the alternative is an illicit circle of autonomous reason. Van Til’s The Defense of the Faith articulates how **analogical knowledge** maps onto method: theology proceeds from Scripture’s principial status, correlating loci by good and necessary consequence, and it engages rival systems by presuppositional critique. Internally, some Reformed thinkers fear that Van Til’s rhetoric risks denying the value of shared logic or of classical theistic demonstrations. Properly read, he does not deny the tools of sound reasoning; he denies their ultimacy apart from God. Externally, critics say presuppositionalism immunizes theology from critique. Van Til’s reply is that the gospel’s offense cannot be evacuated by adopting alien criteria of rationality. The question is not whether we presuppose, but which lord our presuppositions serve.

These figures establish the contours for addressing the three layers of debate that define theology’s nature and task. Internally, the status of **natural theology** is the most persistent fault line. Following Aquinas and Bavinck, with Van Til’s calibration, we can affirm that theology’s foundation is revelation in Scripture while acknowledging that created order witnesses to God and supplies ministerial resources for reasoning about him. The truth that God’s invisible attributes are clearly perceived, as well as the order of being presupposed by **divine simplicity**, justify a limited natural theology that clarifies terms, identifies metaphysical preconditions, and functions apologetically. But it cannot generate articles of faith or norm the reading of Scripture. Within Reformed thought there is also a debate over method. Is theology merely a reorganized biblical theology, or does it advance through synthesis and **confession**? The correct answer is that dogmatics is the church’s confessed synthesis under canonical norms, and it draws on biblical exegesis, churchly tradition, and sanctified reason. It is not a proof-text anthology. Nor is it a free speculation. Its unity and circumscription follow from the formal object and its **principia**.

Externally, Schleiermacher’s project still tempts theologians to conceive theology as a practical discipline for the church’s social efficacy rather than as **sacra doctrina**. The response is not to deny theology’s practical aim, for theology is aimed at preaching, sacrament, and sanctification. Rather, the point is that the practical end depends on truth about God. The church’s life collapses into activism without God as the theological subject. Positivist challenges assert that theology is not a science because it lacks empirical method or falsifiable claims. But science is a genus with many species. A subalternated science such as theology reasons from authoritative first principles given by a competent knower. God is a competent knower. Theology justifies its rationality by displaying coherence, explanatory power, and the fruitfulness of its conceptual framework across loci, all grounded in **revelation**. Barth’s external challenge must also be engaged. His refusal of **natural theology** was prophetic against liberalism, but it need not be absolutized. When bounded by **analogical knowledge** and the priority of Scripture, natural theology serves rather than subverts dogmatics.

Contemporary debates intensify these questions. Analytic theology proposes clarity, formal rigor, and argumentative precision in dogmatics. Properly constrained by the canon and by **classical theism**, analytic tools are gifts. Improperly used, they can smuggle in univocity and erode mystery. The task is to discipline analysis by the Creator–creature distinction, to ensure that conceptual models do not become idols, and to measure success by ecclesial fruitfulness and confessionally informed coherence. The theological interpretation of Scripture movement reminds theology of its necessary return to the canon’s literary form and canonical context. This reform can strengthen dogmatics if it is integrated with the rule of faith and the church’s liturgical life, not if it becomes a new biblicism that neglects **divine simplicity** and metaphysical depth. Contextual and decolonial theologies press theology’s catholicity and its relation to power. Theology must be catholic in spirit, receptive to the many voices of the church across time and space, and alert to cultural idolatries. Yet catholicity is not a substitute principium. The canon norming cultures must not be replaced by cultures norming the canon. Public theology and interdisciplinarity raise the question of theology’s voice in the university and society. Bavinck’s paradigm of **common grace** and **antithesis** gives the right posture: open to shared inquiry by virtue of God’s preserving grace, candid about noetic conflict by virtue of sin, and centered on the gospel by virtue of redemption.

Taking these threads together, the position to defend is clear. Theology is an ecclesial science because its formal object is God speaking and its end is the church’s **doxology** and mission. It is truly a science because it proceeds from authoritative **principia**, maintains internal unity under its formal object, and yields disciplined, testable conclusions across loci. Its method is **analogical knowledge**, which allows meaningful predication of the simple and transcendent God without collapsing him into the world. Reason is ministerial, not magisterial. Natural theology is admitted with constraints: it can identify that God is and clarify what God cannot be, but it cannot supply the articles of faith or set the agenda of **dogmatics**. Scripture is the external principium in a material and formal sense, not simply as a record of experiences or a fallible witness. The Spirit is the internal principium, granting both faith and understanding and thus binding theology to the life of the church. The task of theology is not simply to describe but to confess, not simply to catalog revelation but to synthesize it for the church’s health, and not simply to defend the faith but to display its beauty and coherence under the triune God.

Examiners will press four objections, and they should. First, is this account viciously circular? It begins with Scripture’s authority to prove Scripture’s authority. The answer is that every science is circular at the level of ultimate justification. Geometry presupposes the reliability of its axioms to confirm its theorems. Theology’s circle is virtuous because the triune God self-attests and the Spirit binds hearers to the Word. This is not a bare appeal to subjectivity but a recognition that no higher court can validate God than God. Second, does analogical predication make theology vacuous? If our words do not mean the same for God and creatures, do they mean anything? Aquinas’s insight, deepened by Reformed clarity about the Creator–creature distinction, shows how proportional similarity grounded in God’s causal primacy yields real naming. The perfection of wisdom exists in God eminently; in us formally. The distance is ontological, not semantic nihilism. Third, is natural theology a compromise with autonomous reason? Only if it is detached from and elevated above **revelation**. When conducted within the grammar of **analogical knowledge** and under Scripture’s norm, it clarifies and serves; it does not rule or originate articles of faith. Fourth, can theology be both ecclesial and publicly rational? Yes, because the church’s confessions articulate claims that are rendered in rational discourse, invite evaluation of coherence, and engage rival systems with reasons while standing under the Word. Theology’s public presence is not achieved by abandoning its priestly posture but by faithfully inhabiting it.

The nature and task of theology cannot be insulated from adjacent loci. The doctrine of Scripture determines theology’s principia and norm. The doctrine of God, especially **divine simplicity**, regulates language and method. Christology locates revelation in the incarnate Word and thus secures the possibility of creaturely participation in divine truth. Pneumatology safeguards the internal principium and the sanctification of reason. Ecclesiology names theology’s address and end as the speech of the church for its worship and mission. Anthropology, hamartiology, and soteriology define both the capacity and the impediments of human knowers, as well as the remedies supplied by grace. Theology is not an independent domain; it is the ordering of the whole counsel of God to God.

Finally, the telos of theology must not be obscured. The science of God is ordered to **doxology**. This end is not the negation of discipline but its sanctification. To confess **divine simplicity** coherently, to explicate the **canon** faithfully, to deploy **analogical knowledge** carefully, and to address the world truthfully, are acts of praise. Theology’s materials are the words and works of God. Its school is the church. Its norm is Scripture. Its habitus is faith working through love. Its enemy is autonomy. Its friend is wisdom. Its confidence is the self-attesting Christ. In this confidence, theology may stand before both the church and the university, refusing the false choice between piety and rigor, and carry out its task: to teach the church to say Amen to God’s self-speech and to summon the world to that same Amen.
