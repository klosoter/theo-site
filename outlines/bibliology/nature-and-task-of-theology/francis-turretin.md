# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin defined the **nature and task of theology** as a disciplined, scientific study of **divine revelation**, rooted in **Scripture** and oriented toward the knowledge and worship of God. He distinguished between **theoretical** and **practical theology**, emphasizing theology’s role in both understanding **doctrine** and guiding **piety**. For Turretin, theology is both a **science** and a **wisdom**, serving the church by clarifying truth and refuting error.

- "Theology is the doctrine of living to God, or the science both of things to be believed by us concerning God and of things to be done by us to his glory." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, I.2.5)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Catechetical Writings
- Selected Questions on the Nature of Theology (Institutes, Book I, Questions 1–3)
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science and Wisdom**
   - Theology is a true **science** because it proceeds from first principles (Scripture).
   - It is also **wisdom**, aiming at the highest good—union with God.
   - Theology is both speculative (concerning knowledge) and practical (concerning life).
   - Its certainty is superior to all other sciences because of its divine source.
   - "Theology is called a science not in the sense of a humanly constructed discipline, but as a divinely revealed system." (Institutes I.2.6)

2. **Scripture as the Sole Principle**
   - The **formal principle** of theology is the inspired Word of God.
   - All theological knowledge must be derived from and tested by Scripture.
   - Human reason is subordinate and ministerial, not magisterial.
   - Tradition and church authority serve as aids, not sources.
   - "The principle of theology is the Word of God, not human reason or tradition." (Institutes I.2.8)

3. **Distinction of Theoretical and Practical Theology**
   - Theology is both **theoretical** (knowledge of God) and **practical** (living to God).
   - The two aspects are inseparable but distinct in emphasis.
   - Theoretical theology addresses what is to be believed; practical, what is to be done.
   - The ultimate end is the **glory of God** and the salvation of man.
   - "Theology is theoretical as it contemplates God, practical as it directs us to live for him." (Institutes I.2.7)

4. **Analogy and Limits of Human Knowledge**
   - Human knowledge of God is **analogical**, not univocal.
   - We know God truly but not exhaustively or comprehensively.
   - Theology must respect the Creator-creature distinction.
   - Mystery is inherent in divine things, requiring humility.
   - "We know God not as he is in himself, but as he has revealed himself to us." (Institutes I.4.4)

5. **Polemic and Edificatory Task**
   - Theology must defend the faith against heresy and error (**elenctic** function).
   - It also builds up believers in truth and godliness.
   - The polemic task is always subordinate to the constructive and pastoral.
   - Theologians serve the church by clarifying doctrine and promoting unity.
   - "Theology is elenctic, not for the sake of strife, but for the defense and edification of the church." (Institutes I.1.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of the **nature and task of theology** shaped the Reformed tradition’s understanding of theology as both a **science** and a means of piety. His rigorous distinction between **theoretical** and **practical theology** influenced later Reformed scholasticism and confessional standards. Turretin’s emphasis on **Scripture as the sole principle** remains foundational for Reformed theological method. His legacy endures in the training of ministers and the defense of orthodox doctrine within the church.
