# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the **nature and task of theology** as a fundamentally **transcendental** and **existential** enterprise, rooted in the human experience of God’s self-communication. He emphasized that theology must be both **scientific** in method and **pastoral** in orientation, seeking to articulate the mystery of **revelation** in a way that is meaningful for contemporary humanity.

- "Theology is a science whose object is the mystery of God as it is communicated in revelation and accepted in faith." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Transcendental Method in Theology**
    - Theology must begin with the **subjective conditions** of human knowing and experiencing God.
    - Human openness to **transcendence** is the starting point for theological reflection.
    - The **supernatural existential** is a permanent orientation toward God within every person.
    - Theology explores how revelation is possible given human structures of knowledge.
    - "Man is always already oriented toward God by his very existence." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Theology as Interpretation of Revelation**
    - Theology interprets the **self-communication of God** in history.
    - **Revelation** is not merely propositional but personal and existential.
    - The task of theology is to make revelation intelligible in every age.
    - Faith and theology are inseparable, with theology serving the faith of the Church.
    - "Revelation is God’s free self-communication to man in history." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Unity of Theology and Pastoral Practice**
    - Theology is not an abstract science but serves the **life of the Church**.
    - Theological reflection must address the **concrete questions** of contemporary existence.
    - Theologians have a responsibility to communicate faith in accessible ways.
    - The **pastoral dimension** is intrinsic to authentic theological work.
    - "Theology must be a reflection on faith that is lived and practiced." (Theological Investigations I)

4. **Theological Anthropology**
    - Human beings are defined by their capacity for **God’s self-communication**.
    - The **supernatural existential** grounds every person’s openness to grace.
    - Anthropology and theology are inseparable in understanding revelation.
    - Theological method must account for the **existential situation** of the human person.
    - "Man is the being who hears the word of God." (Hearer of the Word)

5. **Theology as a Critical and Historical Science**
    - Theology must engage critically with its own tradition and contemporary context.
    - It is a **scientific discipline** with its own methods and criteria.
    - Theological statements are historically conditioned and must be reinterpreted.
    - Theology is always in dialogue with philosophy and the sciences.
    - "Theology is a historical science, always in need of renewal and reformulation." (Theological Investigations XX)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s approach to the **nature and task of theology** profoundly shaped twentieth-century Catholic thought, especially through his emphasis on the **transcendental method** and the integration of **anthropology** and **revelation**. His work influenced the Second Vatican Council and set the agenda for much of post-conciliar theology. Rahner’s insistence on theology’s pastoral and existential relevance continues to inform both academic and ecclesial discussions about the role of theology in the modern world.
