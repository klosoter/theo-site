# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge defined the **nature and task of theology** as the scientific study of the facts of **Scripture**, systematized and arranged to reveal the truths God has revealed. He insisted that theology is fundamentally **objective**, rooted in **biblical revelation** rather than speculative philosophy or subjective experience. For Hodge, the theologian’s task is to collect, compare, and organize scriptural data to produce a coherent **system of doctrine**.

- "Theology is the science of the facts of divine revelation so far as those facts concern the nature of God and our relation to Him." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- The Way of Life
- What is Darwinism?
- Princeton Review articles on theological method

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Science**
   - Theology proceeds by collecting and arranging the facts of **Scripture**.
   - It is analogous to the natural sciences in its method, though its subject matter is divine.
   - The theologian’s role is to observe, classify, and systematize revealed truths.
   - Theology is not speculative but grounded in **objective revelation**.
   - "The office of the theologian is not to create truth, but to collect and arrange the facts which God has revealed." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Primacy of Scripture**
   - **Scripture** is the sole source and norm for theological knowledge.
   - All doctrines must be derived from and tested by the biblical text.
   - Human reason is subordinate to the authority of **revelation**.
   - Tradition and experience are valuable but secondary to the **Word of God**.
   - "The Bible is to the theologian what nature is to the man of science." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Objectivity and Certainty**
   - Theology yields real knowledge, not mere opinion or speculation.
   - The facts of **revelation** are as certain as the facts of nature.
   - Theological statements are objectively true if grounded in **Scripture**.
   - The certainty of theology depends on the clarity and sufficiency of **biblical revelation**.
   - "The truths of the Bible are as much matters of fact as the truths of natural science." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Systematic Arrangement**
   - The task of theology is to organize biblical data into a coherent **system**.
   - Systematization aids understanding, teaching, and defense of the faith.
   - Doctrines are to be arranged logically, showing their interconnections.
   - Theological systems must be faithful to the totality of **Scripture**.
   - "The truths revealed in the Bible bear to each other definite relations, and form a system." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Rejection of Speculative Philosophy**
   - Theology must avoid reliance on **philosophical speculation**.
   - Human reason is a tool, not a source, for theological knowledge.
   - The task is to expound what God has revealed, not to construct new doctrines.
   - Speculative systems are to be judged by their fidelity to **biblical revelation**.
   - "The province of reason is simply to discern the truths which God has revealed, and to apprehend their logical relations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s approach to the **nature and task of theology** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially at Princeton Seminary. His emphasis on the **primacy of Scripture** and theology as a scientific discipline became hallmarks of the Old Princeton tradition. While later theologians critiqued his method as overly rationalistic, Hodge’s insistence on the objectivity and coherence of Christian doctrine remains influential in confessional Reformed circles. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between **biblical revelation** and theological method.
