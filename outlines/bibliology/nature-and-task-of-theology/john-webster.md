# John Webster (1955–2016)

John Webster approached the **nature and task of theology** as a discipline fundamentally ordered by **God’s self-revelation** and the **holiness of God**. He insisted that theology is a **scientia**—a spiritual and intellectual habit—whose subject matter is the **triune God** as made known in **Holy Scripture**, and that its proper mode is one of **prayerful, obedient reasoning** within the church.

- "Christian theology is the work of regenerate intelligence, awakened and illuminated by divine instruction." ("Holiness")

## Key Works

- Holiness (2003)
- Confessing God: Essays in Christian Dogmatics II (2016)
- The Domain of the Word: Scripture and Theological Reason (2012)
- Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch (2003)
- "Theology and the Church: Divinity, University, and Society" in Confessing God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theology as a Response to Divine Revelation**
    - Theology begins with and is governed by **God’s self-disclosure** in Jesus Christ.
    - The theologian is a hearer before being a speaker, receiving rather than constructing doctrine.
    - The **Word of God** is both the source and norm of theological reflection.
    - Theology is a discipline of **receptivity** and **attentiveness** to God’s address.
    - "Theology is an act of the intellect, made possible and necessary by the self-communicative presence of God." (Holiness)

2. **Theology as a Holy Science**
    - Theology is a **scientia** ordered by the holiness of its object: the triune God.
    - The discipline is marked by **sanctification**—the theologian’s life is shaped by the subject matter.
    - Theological reasoning is inseparable from **prayer** and **worship**.
    - The holiness of theology distinguishes it from other forms of inquiry.
    - "Theology is holy because its matter is holy, and because its performance is sanctified by the Spirit." (Holiness)

3. **Scripture as the Norming Norm**
    - **Holy Scripture** is the primary medium of God’s self-communication.
    - Theology’s task is to listen to, and expound, the witness of Scripture.
    - The authority of theology is derivative, grounded in the authority of the biblical canon.
    - Theological method is shaped by the **exegetical** and **dogmatic** engagement with Scripture.
    - "Theology is a scriptural activity, governed by the canon of Holy Scripture." (Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch)

4. **The Ecclesial Context of Theology**
    - Theology is a work of and for the **church**, not merely the academy.
    - The theologian is accountable to the **communion of saints** across time and space.
    - The church’s confession and liturgy are vital contexts for theological reflection.
    - The **tradition** of the church serves as a guide and resource for faithful theology.
    - "Theology is an ecclesial science, undertaken in the company of the saints." (Confessing God)

5. **Theological Reason as Spiritual Discipline**
    - Theological reasoning is an act of **regenerate intelligence** under the guidance of the Spirit.
    - The intellect is renewed and sanctified for the task of theology.
    - Theological work requires humility, repentance, and dependence on divine grace.
    - The discipline of theology is both intellectual and spiritual, integrating faith and understanding.
    - "Theology is a spiritual discipline, a work of sanctified reason." (Holiness)

## Legacy and Impact

Webster’s vision of theology as a **holy science** has profoundly influenced contemporary dogmatics, especially in the English-speaking world. His insistence on the primacy of **divine revelation**, the centrality of **Scripture**, and the ecclesial vocation of theology has shaped a generation of theologians. Webster’s work continues to call the church and academy alike to a posture of humility, prayer, and obedience before the triune God.
