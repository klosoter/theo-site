# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine understands the **nature and task of theology** as the disciplined pursuit of **wisdom** rooted in **faith seeking understanding**. For Augustine, theology is inseparable from the **interpretation of Scripture**, the **doctrine of God**, and the **formation of the soul** in love toward God and neighbor.

- "Understanding is the reward of faith. Therefore, seek not to understand that you may believe, but believe that you may understand." (Sermon 43.7.9)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- De Doctrina Christiana (On Christian Doctrine)
- Enchiridion (Handbook on Faith, Hope, and Love)
- City of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith precedes understanding**
    - Theology begins with **faith**, not autonomous reason.
    - **Credo ut intelligam** ("I believe in order to understand") is foundational.
    - Faith is a divine gift, enabling true knowledge of God.
    - Reason serves to deepen and clarify faith, not replace it.
    - "Unless you believe, you will not understand." (Sermon 43.7.9)

2. **Theology is rooted in Scripture**
    - The **Holy Scriptures** are the ultimate authority for theological reflection.
    - Proper interpretation requires humility and dependence on the Holy Spirit.
    - The literal and spiritual senses of Scripture must be discerned.
    - All theological inquiry is measured against the biblical witness.
    - "Let us treat scripture like scripture, and not bring our own ideas to it, but derive our ideas from it." (De Doctrina Christiana, 3.10.14)

3. **Theology aims at the love of God and neighbor**
    - The end of theology is **caritas**—the love of God and neighbor.
    - Knowledge without love is empty and even dangerous.
    - Theological study should lead to spiritual transformation.
    - All doctrinal formulations are subordinate to the command of love.
    - "Whoever, therefore, thinks that he understands the divine Scriptures or any part of them so that it does not build the double love of God and of our neighbor does not understand it at all." (De Doctrina Christiana, 1.36.40)

4. **Theology is contemplative and practical**
    - Theology involves both **contemplation** of divine truth and practical application.
    - The **ordo amoris** (order of loves) guides the Christian life.
    - Theological knowledge must inform ethical action and worship.
    - The pursuit of God is both intellectual and existential.
    - "Theology is taught by God, teaches God, leads to God." (Enchiridion, Preface)

5. **Theology is ecclesial and communal**
    - Theological reflection occurs within the context of the **Church**.
    - Tradition and the consensus of the faithful are important guides.
    - The unity of the Church is essential for sound doctrine.
    - Theologians serve the Church by clarifying and defending the faith.
    - "Let us not seek to understand in order to believe, but believe in order to understand, for unless you believe, you will not understand." (Tractates on the Gospel of John, 29.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s vision of **theology as faith seeking understanding** has profoundly shaped the Western Christian tradition, influencing both **medieval scholasticism** and the **Reformation**. His integration of **Scripture, doctrine, and spiritual formation** remains foundational for systematic theology. Augustine’s insistence on the primacy of love and the centrality of the Church continues to inform contemporary discussions about the nature and purpose of theology.
