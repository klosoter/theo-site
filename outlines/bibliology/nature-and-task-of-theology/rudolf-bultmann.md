# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann redefined the **nature and task of theology** by emphasizing the necessity of **demythologization** and the existential interpretation of the **New Testament kerygma**. He argued that theology must interpret **revelation** within the horizon of modern existential understanding, prioritizing the encounter with the **Word of God** over traditional doctrinal formulations.

- "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization as the Task of Theology**
    - Theology must reinterpret biblical myths to uncover their existential meaning.
    - The mythological worldview of the New Testament is incompatible with modern scientific understanding.
    - Demythologization seeks to reveal the existential truth behind biblical narratives.
    - Theological language must be translated into categories accessible to contemporary people.
    - "What the New Testament says is true, but it is expressed in a mythological language that is no longer credible." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Revelation**
    - Revelation is not propositional but an event confronting the individual.
    - Theological reflection centers on the existential encounter with God’s Word.
    - Faith is a personal response to the kerygma, not assent to historical facts.
    - The meaning of revelation is realized in the self-understanding of the believer.
    - "Faith is the readiness to accept oneself as the one who is addressed by God." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Priority of Kerygma over Doctrine**
    - The proclamation (kerygma) is the heart of Christian faith, not doctrinal systems.
    - Theology must focus on the existential significance of the kerygma.
    - Doctrinal formulations are secondary to the lived encounter with Christ.
    - The church’s message must be continually reinterpreted for each generation.
    - "The kerygma is not a doctrine but an event." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Historical-Critical Method in Theology**
    - Theology must employ critical methods to distinguish history from myth.
    - The historical Jesus is less accessible than the Christ of faith.
    - The value of biblical texts lies in their existential message, not historical accuracy.
    - Critical scholarship is essential for responsible theological reflection.
    - "We cannot use electric light and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

5. **Theology as Interpretation of Human Existence**
    - Theology interprets the meaning of human existence in light of the gospel.
    - The existential situation of the individual is the context for theological reflection.
    - The task of theology is to make the gospel intelligible to modern humanity.
    - Authentic faith involves a radical reorientation of existence.
    - "The question of God is the question of my own existence." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **nature and task of theology** profoundly shaped twentieth-century Protestant thought, especially through his emphasis on **demythologization** and existential interpretation. His work provoked significant debate about the relationship between **faith and history**, influencing both neo-orthodox and existentialist theologians. While controversial, his insistence on making theology relevant to modern existential concerns remains a touchstone in contemporary theological discourse.
