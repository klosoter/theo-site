# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer viewed **the Fall** as a real, historical event that fundamentally altered **human nature** and the **created order**. He insisted that **original sin** is a concrete, inherited condition resulting in **total depravity** and a broken relationship with God, not a myth or mere symbol.

- "Sin is not a metaphysical fate, but the result of a responsible act, an act with incalculable consequences." (Sin, 1971)

## Key Works

- Sin (De zonde, 1957; English trans. 1971)
- Man: The Image of God (De mens het beeld Gods, 1957; English trans. 1962)
- Studies in Dogmatics (multi-volume series, especially volumes on Sin and Man)
- The Providence of God (1952; English trans. 1952)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as Historical and Real**
    - The Fall is a real event in history, not myth or symbol.
    - Adam’s disobedience is the origin of **original sin** for all humanity.
    - Genesis 3 is foundational for understanding human existence.
    - The Fall marks a decisive break in the relationship between God and man.
    "The reality of the Fall is the presupposition of the entire biblical message of redemption." (Sin, p. 27)

2. **Original Sin as Inherited Guilt and Corruption**
    - All humans participate in Adam’s sin and inherit its consequences.
    - **Original guilt** and **corruption** are transmitted to every person.
    - Sin is not merely imitation but a condition affecting the whole person.
    - The universality of sin is a central biblical teaching.
    "Original sin is not a matter of imitation, but of participation." (Sin, p. 53)

3. **Total Depravity and Its Pervasiveness**
    - The Fall results in the total depravity of **human nature**.
    - Every aspect of human life is affected by sin.
    - There is no area of life untouched by the consequences of the Fall.
    - Human inability to restore fellowship with God is total apart from grace.
    "Sin is not a partial defect, but a radical corruption of the whole man." (Sin, p. 105)

4. **Sin as Disruption of Relationship**
    - Sin is fundamentally a breach of **covenant fellowship** with God.
    - The consequences of the Fall are relational, not merely ontological.
    - Alienation from God leads to alienation from self, others, and creation.
    - Redemption is understood as the restoration of this broken relationship.
    "Sin is the rupture of the bond with God, and thus the root of all misery." (Sin, p. 89)

5. **Rejection of Dualistic or Mythological Interpretations**
    - The Fall is not to be explained by dualism or myth.
    - Sin is not a metaphysical necessity but a responsible act.
    - The biblical account resists reduction to existential or symbolic terms.
    - The seriousness of sin is grounded in its historical and ethical reality.
    "The biblical message does not allow us to speak of sin as a metaphysical fate." (Sin, p. 17)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced treatment of **original sin** and the consequences of the Fall shaped twentieth-century Reformed theology, especially through his careful engagement with both traditional dogmatics and modern critical thought. His insistence on the historical reality of the Fall and its pervasive effects provided a robust alternative to existential and liberal reinterpretations. Berkouwer’s work continues to influence discussions on **human depravity**, the nature of sin, and the necessity of redemption within the broader Reformed tradition.
