# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin offered a comprehensive doctrine of **the Fall**, insisting on its historical reality and its foundational role in the propagation of **original sin** and **human depravity**. He maintained that Adam’s transgression resulted in the loss of **original righteousness**, the corruption of human nature, and the imputation of guilt to all his descendants, thus making **redemption** through Christ absolutely necessary.

- "The sin of Adam is imputed to us, not as to its act, but as to its guilt and punishment." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on the Fall and Original Sin (within Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Reality of the Fall**
   - The Fall was a real, historical event involving Adam and Eve in the Garden.
   - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity, representing all his descendants.
   - The Genesis 3 account is factual, not allegorical or mythical.
   - The Fall introduced a radical and permanent change in the human condition.
   "The history of the fall is not a fable, but a true and real event." (Institutes)

2. **Imputation of Adam’s Guilt**
   - Adam’s guilt is imputed to all his posterity through the **covenant of works**.
   - Imputation is legal and forensic, not merely moral or exemplary.
   - All humans are born under condemnation due to Adam’s first sin.
   - This imputation is distinct from the transmission of corruption.
   "We are held guilty of Adam’s sin by imputation, not by imitation." (Institutes)

3. **Propagation of Original Sin**
   - **Original sin** is transmitted to all humans by natural generation.
   - It consists of both the lack of original righteousness and the presence of positive corruption.
   - The whole person—mind, will, and affections—is affected by this corruption.
   - This corruption is the root of all actual sins.
   "Original sin is both the privation of original righteousness and the concupiscence inhering in us." (Institutes)

4. **Total Depravity and Inability**
   - After the Fall, humans are totally depraved and unable to do any spiritual good.
   - The will is not destroyed but is enslaved to sin and unable to turn to God unaided.
   - This depravity is universal, affecting every human being.
   - Only **divine grace** can overcome this inability.
   "Man after the fall is not only wounded, but spiritually dead." (Institutes)

5. **Necessity of Redemption in Christ**
   - The consequences of the Fall make **redemption** in Christ absolutely necessary.
   - Christ is the second Adam, providing righteousness and life to those united to Him.
   - The work of Christ addresses both the guilt and corruption resulting from the Fall.
   - Salvation is by grace alone, in contrast to the works principle broken by Adam.
   "As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of **original sin** and the consequences of the Fall became a standard for later **Reformed orthodoxy**, shaping confessional documents and theological education. His defense of the historicity and seriousness of the Fall reinforced the necessity of **federal headship** and the doctrine of **imputation**. Turretin’s influence persists in contemporary Reformed discussions on anthropology, sin, and the necessity of grace. His careful distinctions and scholastic method continue to serve as a model for systematic theology.
