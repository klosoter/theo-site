# James K.A. Smith (1970– )

James K.A. Smith approaches **the Fall** through the lens of **philosophical anthropology** and **Augustinian theology**, emphasizing the formative power of **disordered loves** and **cultural liturgies** in shaping human brokenness. He interprets the consequences of the Fall not merely as a loss of innocence but as a profound misdirection of human desire, affecting both individual and communal life. Smith’s account highlights how **sin** is perpetuated through practices and institutions that deform our orientation toward God and the good.

- "To be human is to be a lover, and our loves are shaped and aimed by formative practices, most powerfully by the rituals and routines that make up what I call cultural liturgies." (Desiring the Kingdom)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as Disordered Love**
    - The Fall is fundamentally a misdirection of the heart’s desires away from God.
    - Sin is not just a violation of law but a deformation of what and how we love.
    - Human beings are primarily **homo liturgicus**, shaped by what they worship.
    - The consequences of the Fall are seen in the pervasive disordering of human affections.
    - "Sin is a matter of orientation, a misdirection of our love and longing." (Desiring the Kingdom)

2. **Cultural Liturgies Perpetuate Brokenness**
    - Secular practices and routines function as liturgies that reinforce fallen patterns.
    - These liturgies shape our identity and desires, often away from the kingdom of God.
    - The Fall’s consequences are embedded in social and cultural institutions.
    - Redemption requires counter-formative practices rooted in Christian worship.
    - "Our hearts are calibrated through the rituals and routines that make us who we are." (You Are What You Love)

3. **Augustinian Anthropology**
    - Smith draws on Augustine’s view that humans are defined by what they love.
    - The Fall distorts the proper ordering of loves, leading to idolatry.
    - Human flourishing is impossible apart from the reordering of desire toward God.
    - The anthropology of the Fall is both individual and communal in scope.
    - "You are what you love, but you might not love what you think." (You Are What You Love)

4. **Sin as Structural and Personal**
    - The effects of the Fall are not limited to personal morality but extend to societal structures.
    - Institutions and systems can embody and perpetuate sinful patterns.
    - Personal transformation must be accompanied by cultural and institutional renewal.
    - The church’s practices are meant to resist and reform fallen structures.
    - "The church is a counter-formation to the liturgies of the world." (Desiring the Kingdom)

5. **Redemption as Reformation of Desire**
    - Salvation involves the Spirit’s work in reordering our loves toward God.
    - Christian worship is central to re-forming desires and countering the effects of the Fall.
    - Discipleship is a process of habituation, not just information.
    - The ultimate hope is the restoration of creation through rightly ordered love.
    - "Sanctification is a rehabituation of our loves by the Spirit through the practices of the body of Christ." (Imagining the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

James K.A. Smith has significantly influenced contemporary discussions on **the Fall** by reframing sin and its consequences in terms of **desire, liturgy, and cultural formation**. His work has shaped conversations in **Reformed theology**, philosophy, and practical ecclesiology, especially regarding how worship and daily practices form Christian identity. Smith’s insights have prompted renewed attention to the formative power of culture and the necessity of intentional Christian practices to counteract the effects of the Fall. His Augustinian emphasis on the heart and desire continues to resonate in both academic and church contexts.
