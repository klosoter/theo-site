# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a comprehensive doctrine of **the Fall** as the historical event in which **Adam**, acting as **federal head**, brought **original sin** and **total depravity** upon all humanity. The consequences of the Fall are understood as **alienation from God**, **corruption of nature**, and exposure to **God’s wrath and curse**, affecting every aspect of human existence.

- "They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed, and the same death in sin and corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity." (Westminster Confession of Faith 6.3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Fall of Adam and Eve**
   - The Fall is a real, historical event involving Adam and Eve’s disobedience.
   - Adam acted as a **public person** or **federal head** for all his descendants.
   - The act consisted in eating the forbidden fruit, violating God’s explicit command.
   - The Fall resulted in the immediate loss of original righteousness.
   - "Our first parents, being seduced by the subtilty and temptation of Satan, sinned, in eating the forbidden fruit." (WCF 6.1)

2. **Imputation of Adam’s Guilt**
   - Adam’s guilt is **imputed** to all his natural posterity.
   - All humans are born under condemnation due to Adam’s first transgression.
   - This imputation is legal and covenantal, not merely by imitation.
   - The doctrine underscores the **covenant of works** structure.
   - "The guilt of this sin was imputed, and the same death in sin and corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity." (WCF 6.3)

3. **Original Corruption of Nature**
   - Human nature is wholly corrupted as a consequence of the Fall.
   - This corruption extends to every faculty: mind, will, affections.
   - Original corruption is both a state and a source of actual transgressions.
   - Even regenerate persons retain remnants of this corruption in this life.
   - "From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil, do proceed all actual transgressions." (WCF 6.4)

4. **Total Inability and Bondage of the Will**
   - Fallen humanity is unable to do any spiritual good or turn to God apart from grace.
   - The will is in bondage to sin and cannot choose God by its own power.
   - This inability is both moral and spiritual, not natural or physical.
   - The necessity of **effectual calling** and **regeneration** is emphasized.
   - "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation." (WCF 9.3)

5. **Comprehensive Consequences of the Fall**
   - The Fall brings **death**, both spiritual and physical, upon all humanity.
   - All are under God’s **wrath and curse**, liable to miseries in this life, death, and eternal punishment.
   - The effects of the Fall are universal and inescapable apart from redemption in Christ.
   - The doctrine highlights the necessity of **redemption** and **grace**.
   - "All mankind by their fall lost communion with God, are under his wrath and curse, and so made liable to all miseries in this life, to death itself, and to the pains of hell forever." (WSC 19)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology’s** understanding of the Fall and its consequences, providing a systematic and confessional articulation of **original sin**, **imputation**, and **total depravity**. Their influence extends across Presbyterian and many Reformed churches worldwide, serving as a doctrinal benchmark for discussions of human nature, sin, and the necessity of grace. The Standards’ precise language continues to inform theological education, pastoral ministry, and ecumenical dialogue on the doctrine of sin.
