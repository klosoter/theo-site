# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **the Fall** not as a historical event but as a **mythological expression** of the existential condition of **estrangement** and **alienation** inherent to human existence. For Tillich, the consequences of the Fall are seen in the universal experience of **sin**, **anxiety**, and the disruption of the relationship between humanity and **Being-Itself**.

- "The story of the Fall is the story of every man and of every moment in the life of every man." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 2")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as Myth, Not History**
    - The Fall is a symbolic narrative expressing the universal human condition.
    - It reveals the existential reality of **estrangement** from God, self, and others.
    - The myth communicates truths about **freedom**, **finitude**, and the possibility of sin.
    - Adam represents "Everyman," not a single historical figure.
    - "The Fall is not an event in past history but a description of the universal human situation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Estrangement as the Core Consequence**
    - The Fall results in a state of **alienation** from the **Ground of Being**.
    - Estrangement manifests in broken relationships with God, others, and oneself.
    - This alienation is existential, affecting the very structure of human existence.
    - Overcoming estrangement is the central task of **salvation**.
    - "Estrangement is the universal condition of man, and the myth of the Fall expresses this existentially." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Sin as Unavoidable and Universal**
    - Sin is defined as the state of separation from **Being-Itself**.
    - All humans participate in sin as a condition, not merely as individual acts.
    - Sin is rooted in **hubris**—the attempt to be self-sufficient apart from God.
    - The universality of sin is a direct consequence of the Fall's existential meaning.
    - "Sin is separation. To be in the state of sin is to be in the state of separation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Anxiety and Guilt as Consequences**
    - The Fall introduces existential **anxiety** and **guilt** into human life.
    - Anxiety arises from awareness of finitude and estrangement.
    - Guilt is the recognition of one's participation in separation from the divine.
    - These experiences are unavoidable and point to the need for **reconciliation**.
    - "Anxiety is the existential awareness of being estranged from the source of one's being." (The Courage to Be)

5. **Salvation as Reconciliation and New Being**
    - The consequences of the Fall are overcome through **reconciliation** with God.
    - Salvation is the restoration of unity with the **Ground of Being**.
    - The work of Christ is interpreted as the appearance of the **New Being** who overcomes estrangement.
    - Faith is the acceptance of this New Being, not assent to historical propositions.
    - "The New Being appears in the Christ and overcomes the estrangement of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential interpretation of **the Fall** profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in its engagement with **philosophy of existence** and **hermeneutics**. His approach shifted the discussion from historical debates to the existential realities of **sin** and **estrangement**, making traditional doctrines accessible to contemporary audiences. While some critics argue that Tillich’s demythologizing undermines classical doctrines, his work remains foundational for those seeking to relate Christian theology to modern existential concerns.
