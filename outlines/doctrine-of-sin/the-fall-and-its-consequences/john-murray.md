# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a robust account of **the Fall** as a real, historical event with profound implications for **original sin**, **human depravity**, and the necessity of **redemption in Christ**. He emphasized the **federal headship of Adam**, the transmission of guilt and corruption to all humanity, and the utter inability of fallen humans to restore themselves apart from **divine grace**.

- "The fall of Adam was the fall of mankind; the consequences of his sin are visited upon all his posterity." ("The Imputation of Adam's Sin")

## Key Works

- "The Imputation of Adam's Sin" (1959)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "Romans" (NICNT Commentary, esp. on Romans 5:12–21)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (1959, 1965)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Reality of the Fall**
   - The Fall occurred as a real event in space and time, not a myth or mere symbol.
   - Adam was a historical individual whose disobedience constituted the first sin.
   - The narrative of Genesis 3 is foundational for understanding the human condition.
   - Denial of the historicity of the Fall undermines the necessity of redemption.
   - "If we do not have a historical fall, we do not have a historical redemption." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 2")

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
   - Adam acted as the representative head of the human race.
   - His disobedience is imputed to all his descendants by virtue of this covenantal arrangement.
   - The parallel between Adam and Christ (the "second Adam") is central to Paul's argument in Romans 5.
   - The guilt of Adam's sin is judicially reckoned to all humanity.
   - "The relation of Adam to his posterity is that of representative and head." ("The Imputation of Adam's Sin")

3. **Transmission of Original Sin**
   - All humans inherit both the guilt and corruption resulting from Adam's first sin.
   - Original sin is not merely imitation but a real transmission of depravity.
   - The corruption affects every aspect of human nature, rendering all people sinners by nature.
   - The doctrine safeguards the necessity of **regeneration** and **justification** by grace.
   - "Original sin consists in the loss of original righteousness and the corruption of the whole nature." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 2")

4. **Total Depravity and Inability**
   - The Fall resulted in total depravity, affecting mind, will, and affections.
   - Fallen humanity is incapable of pleasing God or turning to Him apart from grace.
   - Sin is not merely a matter of external acts but of the very disposition of the heart.
   - The doctrine underscores the radical need for **sovereign grace** in salvation.
   - "The inability is total; it is not simply that man will not, but that he cannot." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

5. **Necessity of Redemption in Christ**
   - The consequences of the Fall make redemption absolutely necessary.
   - Christ, as the second Adam, provides the only remedy for sin and its effects.
   - Justification and sanctification are grounded in Christ's obedience and sacrifice.
   - The work of Christ is the reversal and remedy of Adam's transgression.
   - "As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." ("Romans" commentary)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray's articulation of **the Fall** and its consequences has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in the areas of **original sin**, federal headship, and the necessity of Christ's redemptive work. His careful exegesis and theological clarity continue to influence contemporary discussions on **human depravity** and the doctrine of salvation. Murray's legacy endures in the ongoing defense of the historicity of Adam and the centrality of grace in overcoming the effects of the Fall.
