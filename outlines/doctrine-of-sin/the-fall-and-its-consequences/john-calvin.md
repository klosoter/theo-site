# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin taught that **the Fall** of Adam resulted in the universal corruption of human nature, introducing **original sin** and rendering all humanity guilty and depraved. He emphasized that the consequences of the Fall extend to every aspect of human existence, necessitating **divine grace** for salvation and restoration. Calvin’s doctrine of the Fall is foundational for his understanding of **total depravity**, **federal headship**, and the need for **redemption in Christ**.

- "Therefore all of us, who have descended from impure seed, are born infected with the contagion of sin." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 2.1.5)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Universality of Original Sin**
    - The Fall resulted in the corruption of the entire human race through Adam’s transgression.
    - All people inherit both **guilt** and **corruption** from Adam as their federal head.
    - Original sin is not merely imitation but a real transmission of depravity.
    - This condition affects the whole person: mind, will, affections, and body.
    - "Original sin, therefore, appears to be a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature." (Institutes 2.1.8)

2. **Total Depravity**
    - Human faculties are so corrupted by the Fall that people are incapable of true righteousness.
    - The will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose God apart from grace.
    - Even seemingly good actions are tainted by sinful motives.
    - There is no spiritual good in humanity apart from regeneration.
    - "Man’s nature is not only utterly devoid of goodness, but so prolific in all kinds of evil that it can never be idle." (Institutes 2.3.5)

3. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the representative of all humanity in the covenant of works.
    - His disobedience is imputed to all his descendants.
    - The Fall is both a historical event and a legal transaction affecting all.
    - This headship sets the pattern for Christ as the second Adam.
    - "For as Adam’s ruin involved us all, so Christ’s righteousness is imparted to us." (Institutes 2.1.6)

4. **Consequences for Creation**
    - The Fall brought not only human corruption but also disorder into the entire creation.
    - The curse affects the physical world: suffering, death, and futility.
    - Creation itself longs for redemption and renewal.
    - The effects of the Fall are cosmic, not merely individual or spiritual.
    - "The whole order of nature is perverted by the Fall, so that nothing remains in its original integrity." (Commentary on Genesis 3:17)

5. **Necessity of Divine Grace for Restoration**
    - Fallen humanity is utterly dependent on God’s initiative for salvation.
    - Regeneration and faith are gifts of **sovereign grace**, not human effort.
    - The work of Christ is the only remedy for the consequences of the Fall.
    - Grace restores, but does not immediately perfect, the fallen image of God.
    - "We are so vitiated and perverted in every part of our nature that by ourselves we can do nothing but sin." (Institutes 2.3.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of the Fall profoundly shaped **Reformed anthropology** and the broader Protestant understanding of sin and grace. His articulation of **original sin** and **total depravity** became foundational for later confessional standards such as the Westminster Confession. Calvin’s emphasis on the necessity of **divine grace** continues to influence contemporary discussions on human nature, salvation, and the scope of redemption. His legacy endures in both theological scholarship and the practical piety of Reformed churches worldwide.
