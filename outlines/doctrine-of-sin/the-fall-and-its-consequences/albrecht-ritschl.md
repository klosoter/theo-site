# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl interpreted **the Fall** not as a historical event but as a symbolic account of humanity’s universal tendency toward **sin** and **moral failure**. He rejected traditional doctrines of **original sin** and **total depravity**, emphasizing instead the ethical and communal consequences of alienation from God. For Ritschl, the Fall’s significance lies in its impact on **human freedom** and the disruption of the **kingdom of God** as a moral community.

- "The narrative of the Fall is a mythological expression of the universal fact of sinfulness in human life." (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation (Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung)
- Instruction in the Christian Religion (Unterricht in der christlichen Religion)
- A Critical History of the Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation
- Theology and Metaphysics (various essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as Symbolic, Not Historical**
    - The Genesis account is interpreted as a myth expressing universal human experience.
    - Rejects a literal, historical Adam and Eve.
    - The Fall represents the existential reality of sin, not a single ancestral act.
    - Emphasizes the narrative’s function in illuminating the human condition.
    - "The story of the Fall is not a historical report, but a symbolic representation of the fact of sin." (Justification and Reconciliation)

2. **Sin as Ethical, Not Metaphysical**
    - Sin is defined in terms of ethical failure and self-centeredness.
    - Denies inherited **guilt** or metaphysical corruption.
    - Focuses on the disruption of the moral relationship with God.
    - Sin is overcome through moral transformation, not forensic imputation.
    - "Sin is not a substance or a state transmitted, but the result of free acts of self-assertion against God." (Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Rejection of Original Sin**
    - The doctrine of original sin is seen as speculative and unbiblical.
    - Emphasizes personal responsibility for sin.
    - Humanity’s sinful condition arises from social and historical factors.
    - The concept of inherited guilt is incompatible with God’s justice.
    - "The dogma of original sin has no foundation in the teaching of Jesus." (Instruction in the Christian Religion)

4. **Consequences of the Fall: Alienation from the Kingdom of God**
    - The Fall disrupts the formation of the **kingdom of God** as an ethical community.
    - Alienation is primarily relational and ethical, not ontological.
    - Restoration focuses on reestablishing community and moral purpose.
    - The consequences are overcome through participation in the Christian community.
    - "The true consequence of sin is estrangement from the kingdom of God, not a change in human nature." (Justification and Reconciliation)

5. **Christ as the Restorer of Moral Community**
    - Christ’s work is to restore the ethical relationship between God and humanity.
    - Redemption is understood as moral renewal, not legal satisfaction.
    - The church is the locus of restored community and reconciliation.
    - Emphasizes the practical realization of the **kingdom of God** in history.
    - "Christ brings reconciliation by founding the community in which the will of God is realized." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s reinterpretation of **the Fall** shifted Protestant theology away from metaphysical and forensic categories toward ethical and communal concerns. His emphasis on the **kingdom of God** and the symbolic reading of Genesis influenced liberal theology and the development of modern Christian ethics. While criticized by confessional traditions for downplaying **original sin**, Ritschl’s legacy endures in discussions of sin, freedom, and the social dimensions of redemption.
