# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til understood **the Fall** as a decisive historical event that radically corrupted human **nature**, resulting in total **depravity** and a fundamental **antithesis** between the thinking of the regenerate and unregenerate. For Van Til, the consequences of the Fall are not merely ethical but epistemological, affecting all human reasoning and making **autonomous thought** a hallmark of fallen humanity. Redemption in Christ alone restores true knowledge and fellowship with God.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as a Historical and Catastrophic Event**
    - The Fall occurred in real time and space, involving Adam as the federal head.
    - It introduced a radical ethical and epistemological rupture between God and man.
    - All of creation was affected, not just human moral capacity.
    - The event established the need for **redemptive revelation**.
    - "The entrance of sin into the world was a catastrophic event that affected every aspect of man's being." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Total Depravity and the Noetic Effects of Sin**
    - The Fall resulted in total depravity, corrupting every faculty, including the mind.
    - Fallen humanity suppresses the truth in unrighteousness.
    - Sin distorts all human reasoning and perception of reality.
    - No area of life or thought is untouched by the consequences of the Fall.
    - "Sin is ethical in its nature and affects the whole man, including his intellect." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Antithesis Between Believer and Unbeliever**
    - The Fall established a fundamental antithesis between the regenerate and unregenerate.
    - This antithesis is epistemological, not merely moral or spiritual.
    - Unbelievers interpret reality from a position of autonomy, in opposition to God.
    - Believers, by grace, are restored to true knowledge and fellowship.
    - "There is no common ground in principle between the Christian and the non-Christian." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Autonomy as the Essence of Sin**
    - The essence of the Fall is man’s claim to autonomy from God.
    - Fallen man seeks to be the ultimate reference point for knowledge and ethics.
    - This autonomous stance is the root of all idolatry and rebellion.
    - True knowledge begins with submission to God’s revelation.
    - "The essence of sin is to make oneself the ultimate standard of truth." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Redemption as Epistemological Restoration**
    - Salvation in Christ restores man to true knowledge of God and self.
    - Regeneration renews the mind, enabling submission to divine revelation.
    - The antithesis is overcome only in Christ, not by natural reason or common ground.
    - The Christian worldview is grounded in the self-attesting authority of Scripture.
    - "Only by regeneration can man be restored to true knowledge and fellowship with God." (Christian Apologetics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s doctrine of the Fall and its consequences has profoundly shaped **Reformed apologetics**, especially the presuppositional approach. His emphasis on the **antithesis** and the noetic effects of sin challenged traditional views of reason and natural theology. Van Til’s insights continue to influence debates on the relationship between faith and reason, the nature of unbelief, and the necessity of **redemptive revelation** for true knowledge. His legacy endures in the ongoing development of Reformed epistemology and apologetic method.
