# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **the Fall** not as a historical event but as a symbolic expression of **universal human sinfulness** and the disruption of **God-consciousness**. He emphasized the existential consequences of the Fall, focusing on the alienation of the human spirit from its original unity with God, rather than on inherited **original guilt** or forensic condemnation.

- "The doctrine of original sin is nothing other than the description of the universal sinfulness of human nature." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Schleiermacher: Life and Thought (ed. Richard Crouter)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as Symbolic, Not Historical**
    - The Fall represents the universal condition of **estrangement from God**, not a literal event.
    - Schleiermacher rejects a historical Adam as necessary for explaining sin.
    - The narrative of Genesis is interpreted as mythic, expressing existential realities.
    - Human sinfulness is seen as a constant, not as a result of a single act.
    - "The story of the Fall is a mythical representation of a truth that is always present." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Sin as Lack of God-Consciousness**
    - Sin is defined as the absence or suppression of **God-consciousness**.
    - The essence of sin is self-assertion over dependence on God.
    - All humans share this condition, which is rooted in the structure of consciousness.
    - Sin is not primarily legal guilt but spiritual alienation.
    - "Sin is simply the lack of the God-consciousness which should be dominant in us." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Rejection of Forensic Original Guilt**
    - Schleiermacher denies the transmission of **original guilt** from Adam.
    - He argues that guilt cannot be inherited but arises from personal acts.
    - The universality of sin is explained by the social and existential context, not biological descent.
    - The doctrine of inherited guilt is seen as incompatible with moral responsibility.
    - "There is no place for the imputation of Adam’s guilt to his descendants." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Solidarity of Sinful Human Nature**
    - All humans participate in a shared, corrupted **human nature**.
    - Sinfulness is propagated through social and existential solidarity, not physical descent.
    - The universality of sin is a fact of experience, not a metaphysical inheritance.
    - Redemption must address the communal and existential dimensions of sin.
    - "Sinfulness is propagated because each individual is born into a sinful environment." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Consequences of the Fall: Alienation and Need for Redemption**
    - The Fall results in alienation from God and disordered selfhood.
    - Human beings are unable to restore **God-consciousness** by their own efforts.
    - The consequences are existential: loss of unity, spiritual fragmentation, and moral weakness.
    - Redemption is necessary to restore the original relationship with God.
    - "The consequence of sin is the disruption of the unity of consciousness with God." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **the Fall** profoundly influenced modern theology by shifting the focus from historical and forensic categories to existential and experiential realities. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** and the symbolic reading of Genesis paved the way for later liberal and existential approaches to sin and redemption. While controversial among confessional theologians, his work remains foundational for understanding the development of modern **systematic theology** and the move away from traditional doctrines of **original sin**.
