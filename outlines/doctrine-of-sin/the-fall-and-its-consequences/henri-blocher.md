# Henri Blocher (1937–)

Henri Blocher presents **the Fall** as a historical and theological event that fundamentally altered the state of **humanity**, introducing **sin**, **death**, and **alienation from God** into the created order. He emphasizes the **universality of original sin** and the profound consequences for **human nature** and the **cosmos**, while maintaining a nuanced reading of the Genesis account that respects both its literary form and doctrinal weight.

- "The Fall is not only the explanation of evil; it is the explanation of ourselves." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

## Key Works

- In the Beginning: The Opening Chapters of Genesis
- Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle
- Evil and the Cross: An Analytical Look at the Problem of Pain
- "Agnus Victor: The Atonement as Victory and Vicarious Punishment" (in What Does It Mean to Be Saved?)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Reality of the Fall**
    - Affirms that **the Fall** is a real event in human history, not merely a myth or allegory.
    - Argues that the narrative of Genesis 3 conveys genuine historical consequences for all humanity.
    - Maintains that the historicity of the Fall is essential for a coherent doctrine of **original sin**.
    - Sees the event as the entry point of **evil** and **death** into the world.
    - "If the Fall is not real, then the redemption it necessitates loses its meaning." (In the Beginning)

2. **Universality of Original Sin**
    - Teaches that all human beings inherit a corrupted nature due to Adam’s transgression.
    - Emphasizes the solidarity of the human race in **Adam**, making sin a universal condition.
    - Connects the doctrine of original sin to the need for **redemption** in Christ.
    - Argues that original sin is both a state and a guilt imputed to all.
    - "Original sin is the riddle that lies at the heart of the human condition." (Original Sin)

3. **Anthropological Consequences**
    - The Fall results in the distortion of the **imago Dei** in humanity.
    - Human faculties—mind, will, and affections—are all affected by sin.
    - Alienation from God, self, others, and creation stems from the Fall.
    - The human propensity toward evil is rooted in this inherited corruption.
    - "The image of God is not erased, but it is profoundly marred." (In the Beginning)

4. **Cosmic Consequences**
    - The Fall’s effects extend beyond humanity to the entire **created order**.
    - Disorder, suffering, and death in the natural world are traced to Adam’s sin.
    - The cosmos is subjected to futility and awaits redemption.
    - The restoration of creation is tied to the work of Christ, the second Adam.
    - "The groaning of creation is the echo of Adam’s disobedience." (In the Beginning)

5. **Theological Interpretation of Genesis**
    - Advocates a literary and theological reading of Genesis 1–3, avoiding both naive literalism and pure symbolism.
    - Sees the text as conveying profound truths about **sin**, **freedom**, and **responsibility**.
    - Maintains that the narrative structure is essential for understanding the doctrine of the Fall.
    - Argues that theological meaning is inseparable from the narrative’s historical claims.
    - "The story is the vehicle of the doctrine, and the doctrine is the soul of the story." (In the Beginning)

## Legacy and Impact

Blocher’s work on **the Fall** has shaped contemporary evangelical and Reformed discussions by insisting on both the doctrinal necessity and historical reality of the event. His nuanced approach to **original sin** and the consequences of the Fall has influenced debates on **human nature**, **theodicy**, and biblical interpretation. Blocher’s integration of literary, theological, and historical analysis continues to inform scholarship and pastoral teaching on the origins and effects of sin.
