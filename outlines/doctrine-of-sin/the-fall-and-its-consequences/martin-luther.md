# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther viewed **the Fall** as a decisive historical event that resulted in the total corruption of human nature and the loss of original righteousness. He emphasized the pervasive consequences of **original sin**, which left humanity utterly dependent on **divine grace** for salvation and incapable of restoring itself through works or reason.

- "Original sin is not a slight, but so deep a corruption of human nature that no reason can understand it; it must be believed because of the revelation in the Scriptures." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis (1535–1545)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Commentary on Romans (1515–1516)
- Small Catechism (1529)
- Large Catechism (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as a Historical Event**
    - Adam and Eve’s disobedience in Eden was a real, historical act.
    - The Fall marked the entrance of **sin** and **death** into the created order.
    - Humanity’s original righteousness was lost entirely.
    - The event is foundational for understanding the need for **redemption**.
    - "The Fall was not a trivial matter, but the very source of all our misery." (Lectures on Genesis)

2. **Total Depravity of Human Nature**
    - After the Fall, every aspect of human nature is corrupted by sin.
    - Human will is in bondage and cannot choose good apart from grace.
    - Even reason and affections are distorted by original sin.
    - There is no spark of righteousness left in fallen humanity.
    - "Free will after the Fall exists in name only, and as long as it does what it is able, it commits mortal sin." (The Bondage of the Will)

3. **Transmission of Original Sin**
    - Original sin is inherited by all descendants of Adam and Eve.
    - It is not merely imitation but a real, inward corruption.
    - Baptism is necessary to address the guilt and corruption from birth.
    - The universality of sin underscores the need for **justification by faith**.
    - "All men are conceived and born in sin, that is, from their mother’s womb they are full of evil lust and inclination." (Large Catechism)

4. **Consequences for Human Ability**
    - Fallen humanity cannot fulfill the law or merit salvation.
    - Good works are impossible without the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit.
    - The law reveals sin but cannot heal or restore.
    - Salvation is entirely a work of God’s grace, not human effort.
    - "After the Fall, man’s powers are not only wounded, but completely destroyed." (Commentary on Romans)

5. **Christ as the Only Remedy**
    - Only Christ’s atoning work can reverse the effects of the Fall.
    - Justification is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.
    - The promise of redemption was given immediately after the Fall (Genesis 3:15).
    - The new creation in Christ restores what was lost in Adam.
    - "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s doctrine of **the Fall** profoundly shaped Protestant understandings of **original sin**, human inability, and the necessity of **grace**. His insistence on the total corruption of human nature and the bondage of the will set the stage for later Reformation debates and confessional formulations. Luther’s teaching remains foundational for Lutheran and broader Protestant anthropology, emphasizing the radical need for Christ’s redemptive work.
