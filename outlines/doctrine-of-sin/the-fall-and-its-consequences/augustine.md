# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **the Fall** is foundational for Western Christianity, emphasizing the catastrophic effects of **original sin** on human nature and the created order. He taught that Adam’s disobedience resulted in the universal transmission of **guilt** and **corruption**, rendering all humanity subject to **death**, **concupiscence**, and the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation.

- "In Adam, all die; and so the whole mass of condemned humanity is justly condemned." (City of God, XIII.14)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, and on the Baptism of Infants
- On Nature and Grace
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Inherited Guilt and Corruption**
    - Adam’s sin is imputed to all his descendants, resulting in universal guilt.
    - Human nature is fundamentally corrupted, not merely wounded.
    - This corruption is transmitted through natural generation.
    - All are born under condemnation and in need of redemption.
    - "The sin of the first man has passed into all men by propagation, not by imitation." (On Nature and Grace, 3.3)

2. **The Fall’s Effect on Human Will**
    - The will is enslaved to sin after the Fall.
    - True freedom is lost; only **grace** can liberate the will.
    - Human beings are incapable of choosing the good without divine aid.
    - The bondage of the will is both moral and spiritual.
    - "For it is by the law of sin that the will is made captive." (Enchiridion, 30.112)

3. **Universal Need for Divine Grace**
    - No one can be saved apart from **God’s prevenient and efficacious grace**.
    - Grace is necessary for both the beginning and continuance of faith.
    - Even the desire to turn to God is itself a gift of grace.
    - Salvation is entirely dependent on God’s initiative.
    - "Without God’s grace, no one is delivered from the condemnation deserved by the first birth." (On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, I.9)

4. **Death and Disorder as Consequences of the Fall**
    - Physical and spiritual death entered the world through Adam’s sin.
    - The created order itself became subject to futility and decay.
    - Human relationships and desires are now disordered (concupiscence).
    - Suffering and mortality are universal consequences of the Fall.
    - "By the just judgment of God, all men are born with ignorance and difficulty." (City of God, XIII.3)

5. **Solidarity of Humanity in Adam**
    - Adam acted as the representative head of the human race.
    - All humanity shares in Adam’s guilt and punishment.
    - The unity of the human race is both natural and moral.
    - Redemption must address both individual and corporate dimensions of sin.
    - "All men were in that one man, since all men were that one man who fell into sin." (City of God, XIII.14)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s doctrine of **original sin** profoundly shaped Western Christian anthropology, soteriology, and the understanding of **grace**. His views became normative for medieval theology and were foundational for both Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. The Augustinian emphasis on the necessity of grace and the depth of human depravity remains a central reference point in debates about human nature, freedom, and redemption.
