# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. views **the Fall** as a decisive, historical event that introduced **sin and death** into the world, fundamentally corrupting humanity and the created order. He stresses the importance of **federal headship**, the universality of **original sin**, and the necessity of **redemption in Christ** within the framework of **redemptive history** and **covenant theology**.

- "The entrance of sin and death into the world through Adam is the indispensable presupposition for understanding the work of Christ." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on the Structure of Biblical Ethics" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- Perspectives on Pentecost

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Reality of the Fall**
    - The Fall is a real, space-time event involving Adam as a historical individual.
    - Adam’s disobedience introduced **sin and death** into the created order.
    - The narrative of Genesis 3 is foundational for understanding the human predicament.
    - Denial of the Fall’s historicity undermines the necessity and coherence of redemption.
    "If Adam is not a real historical figure, then the parallel with Christ in Romans 5 collapses." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Federal Headship and Representation**
    - Adam acted as the **covenant head** of humanity in the original creation covenant.
    - His transgression is imputed to all his descendants, resulting in universal guilt.
    - The structure of representation is mirrored and reversed in Christ’s obedience.
    - This federal framework undergirds Paul’s soteriology in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15.
    "The solidarity of the one and the many is essential to Paul’s understanding of both condemnation and justification." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Pervasiveness of Original Sin**
    - The Fall resulted in the corruption of human nature—**total depravity**.
    - Sin is not merely external acts but an inward, pervasive condition.
    - All aspects of human existence are affected, necessitating comprehensive redemption.
    - The universality of death testifies to the universality of sin’s reign.
    "Sin is not simply an act but a power that reigns in the present age." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Reversal in Christ**
    - Christ, as the **Last Adam**, undoes the consequences of the Fall through his resurrection.
    - Redemption is not merely individual but cosmic, affecting the entire created order.
    - Believers are united to Christ and participate in the new creation inaugurated by his resurrection.
    - The eschatological tension between the “already” and “not yet” frames Christian existence post-Fall.
    "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new creation and the definitive reversal of Adam’s Fall." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Necessity of Eschatological Consummation**
    - The effects of the Fall will not be fully eradicated until the return of Christ.
    - The present age is marked by the ongoing conflict between the old and new creations.
    - The consummation will bring the final defeat of death and the restoration of all things.
    - Christian hope is grounded in the future bodily resurrection and renewal of creation.
    "The consummation is the final answer to the problem introduced by the Fall." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **Fall and its consequences** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in the areas of **Pauline soteriology** and **redemptive-historical interpretation**. His insistence on the historical Adam and the federal structure of salvation has influenced debates on biblical authority and theological anthropology. Gaffin’s work continues to inform discussions on the relationship between **systematic and biblical theology**, ensuring the centrality of the Fall in understanding the gospel and Christian hope.
