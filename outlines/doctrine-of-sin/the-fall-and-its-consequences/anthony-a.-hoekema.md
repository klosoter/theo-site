# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema approached **the Fall** as a historical and universal event with devastating consequences for **human nature**, emphasizing the pervasive effects of **original sin** and the disruption of the **imago Dei**. He maintained that the Fall resulted in total depravity, affecting every aspect of human existence, yet did not erase the image of God entirely, leaving hope for **redemption** through Christ.

- "The fall into sin did not destroy the image of God in man, but it did pervert and distort it." (Created in God's Image)

## Key Works

- Created in God's Image (1986)
- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- Saved by Grace (1989)
- Sin and Salvation in Christian Counseling (Journal articles)
- The Four Major Cults (1963; relevant for his doctrine of man and sin)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as a Historical Event**
    - The Fall occurred in real time-space history through Adam and Eve.
    - It introduced **sin** and **death** into the created order.
    - The historicity of the Fall is foundational for understanding **redemption**.
    - Denial of the Fall undermines the necessity of Christ’s atonement.
    - "If the fall is not a fact, the work of Christ loses its meaning." (Created in God's Image)

2. **Total Depravity and Pervasiveness of Sin**
    - The Fall resulted in total depravity, affecting every part of human nature.
    - No aspect of human life is untouched by the consequences of sin.
    - Total depravity does not mean utter depravity; humans retain the image of God.
    - Sin is both a condition and an act, rooted in the heart.
    - "Total depravity means that the corruption of sin extends to every part of man's nature." (Created in God's Image)

3. **Distortion, Not Erasure, of the Imago Dei**
    - The image of God in humanity is distorted, not destroyed, by the Fall.
    - Fallen humans still possess dignity and responsibility before God.
    - Restoration of the image is central to **redemption in Christ**.
    - The image includes structural and functional aspects, both affected by sin.
    - "Man did not cease to be man after the fall, nor did he lose the image of God." (Created in God's Image)

4. **Original Sin and Its Transmission**
    - All humans are implicated in Adam’s first sin.
    - Original sin is both guilt and corruption inherited from Adam.
    - The unity of the human race is essential for understanding original sin.
    - The consequences of the Fall are both judicial and moral.
    - "We are not sinners merely because we sin; we sin because we are sinners." (Created in God's Image)

5. **Hope of Redemption Despite the Fall**
    - The effects of the Fall are not the final word for humanity.
    - God’s redemptive plan centers on the restoration of the image of God.
    - Christ’s work addresses both guilt and corruption from the Fall.
    - The doctrine of the Fall highlights the necessity and sufficiency of grace.
    - "The restoration of the image of God in man is the goal of redemption." (Created in God's Image)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s robust articulation of **the Fall** and its consequences has shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology, especially in discussions of **original sin** and the **imago Dei**. His insistence on the historical reality of the Fall and the enduring, though marred, image of God in humanity has influenced evangelical and Reformed approaches to sin, salvation, and human dignity. Hoekema’s work continues to serve as a standard reference for understanding the depth of human depravity and the hope of restoration through Christ.
