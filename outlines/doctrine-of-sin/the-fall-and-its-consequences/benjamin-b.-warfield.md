# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield offered a robustly **Augustinian** and **Reformed** account of the **Fall** and its consequences, emphasizing the historical reality of Adam’s transgression and the resulting **original sin**. He maintained that the Fall introduced both **guilt** and **corruption** into the human race, necessitating **redemption** through Christ as the only remedy for humanity’s lost estate.

- "The Pauline doctrine of the universality of sin rests on the universality of the fall in Adam." ("The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity," in Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Biblical Doctrine of Original Sin" (in Biblical Doctrines)
- "The Human Development of Jesus" (in The Person and Work of Christ)
- "Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy"
- "Calvin and Calvinism"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Adam and the Fall**
    - The Fall is a real, historical event involving a literal Adam.
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity.
    - The narrative of Genesis is foundational for understanding human sinfulness.
    - Denial of the historical Fall undermines the doctrine of **redemption**.
    - "If there was no fall, there is no need of redemption." (Biblical Doctrines)

2. **Original Sin and Imputed Guilt**
    - All humanity inherits both the guilt and corruption of Adam’s first sin.
    - **Original sin** is not merely imitation but a transmitted condition.
    - Warfield affirms the **imputation** of Adam’s guilt to his descendants.
    - This doctrine safeguards the necessity of **grace** for salvation.
    - "We are not sinners because we sin, but we sin because we are sinners." (Biblical Doctrines)

3. **Total Depravity**
    - The Fall resulted in the total depravity of human nature.
    - Every aspect of human faculties is affected by sin.
    - Humans are incapable of self-recovery or meritorious action before God.
    - The will is enslaved to sin apart from divine intervention.
    - "The inability of man is not physical but moral." (The Plan of Salvation)

4. **Federal Headship**
    - Adam’s role as representative means his act is legally and covenantally binding for all.
    - The **covenant of works** frames the relationship between Adam and his posterity.
    - Christ’s work is understood in parallel as the second Adam.
    - This structure upholds the coherence of **justification** by imputation.
    - "The parallel between Adam and Christ is the key to Paul’s doctrine of salvation." (Biblical Doctrines)

5. **Necessity of Redemption**
    - The consequences of the Fall make redemption absolutely necessary.
    - Only Christ’s atoning work can address both guilt and corruption.
    - The universality of sin highlights the universal need for the gospel.
    - Warfield insists on the exclusivity of Christ as Redeemer.
    - "The salvation that is in Christ is the only hope for a fallen race." (The Plan of Salvation)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of the **Fall** and its consequences shaped twentieth-century **Reformed theology**, especially in defending the doctrines of **original sin** and **total depravity** against modernist reinterpretations. His insistence on the historical Adam and the necessity of redemption remains influential in evangelical and confessional circles. Warfield’s work continues to serve as a bulwark for orthodox understandings of sin and grace in systematic theology.
