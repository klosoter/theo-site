# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches **the Fall** as a historical event with profound consequences for **human nature**, **covenant relationship**, and the **created order**. He emphasizes the **noetic effects of sin**, the disruption of **God’s lordship attributes** (authority, control, presence), and the pervasive corruption that necessitates **redemption in Christ**.

- "The Fall is not merely a lapse in behavior, but a radical change in the human heart and mind, affecting every aspect of our existence." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord
- The Doctrine of the Word of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as Historical and Covenantal**
    - The Fall occurred in real space-time history with Adam as the federal head.
    - It represents a breach of the original **covenant of works**.
    - The event is foundational for understanding **original sin** and human depravity.
    - The consequences are both judicial (guilt) and existential (corruption).
    - "Adam’s sin was not merely personal but covenantal, affecting all his descendants." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Total Depravity and the Noetic Effects of Sin**
    - Sin affects every faculty of human beings: mind, will, emotions.
    - The Fall leads to a radical inability to please God apart from grace.
    - Even human reasoning is corrupted, resulting in **suppression of truth**.
    - The noetic effects of sin are central to Frame’s epistemology.
    - "Sin distorts not only our actions but our very perception of reality." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

3. **Disruption of God’s Lordship Attributes**
    - The Fall distorts humanity’s relationship to God’s authority, control, and presence.
    - Humans rebel against God’s authority, seek autonomy, and experience alienation.
    - The created order is subjected to futility and frustration.
    - Restoration requires a reestablishment of God’s lordship in Christ.
    - "Sin is fundamentally rebellion against the lordship of God in all its aspects." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Cosmic and Ethical Consequences**
    - The Fall introduces disorder into all creation, not just humanity.
    - Ethical norms are corrupted, leading to moral confusion and injustice.
    - The world is now a battleground between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness.
    - Redemption is cosmic, involving the renewal of all things in Christ.
    - "The effects of the Fall are cosmic in scope, touching every aspect of creation." (The Doctrine of God)

5. **Necessity of Redemption and Grace**
    - Human beings cannot restore themselves; only divine grace suffices.
    - The Fall sets the stage for the **covenant of grace** and the work of Christ.
    - Salvation is wholly dependent on God’s initiative and sovereign mercy.
    - The gospel addresses both guilt and corruption introduced by the Fall.
    - "Only God’s grace in Christ can reverse the devastation wrought by the Fall." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s articulation of the **Fall and its consequences** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in its emphasis on the **covenantal** and **epistemological** dimensions of sin. His tri-perspectival approach offers a nuanced understanding of how the Fall affects every aspect of human life and knowledge. Frame’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking a robust, biblically grounded account of human depravity and the necessity of redemption.
