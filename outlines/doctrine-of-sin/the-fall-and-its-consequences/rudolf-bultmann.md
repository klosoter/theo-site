# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **the Fall** and its consequences through the lens of **demythologization**, interpreting the Genesis narrative as an existential description of the human condition rather than a historical event. For Bultmann, **sin** is not inherited guilt but the universal reality of **alienation** and **inauthentic existence** before God, manifesting in every person's turning away from divine truth. The consequences of the Fall are thus existential, emphasizing **estrangement** and the need for **revelation** in Christ.

- "The mythological event of the Fall is only the objectification of the existential fact that every man is a sinner." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of the Fall**
   - The Genesis account is a mythological expression of existential truth, not a literal history.
   - The story symbolizes the universal human situation of **sin** and **estrangement** from God.
   - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind biblical narratives.
   - The Fall is a paradigm for understanding human existence, not a chronological event.
   - "The real meaning of the myth is to be found in the self-understanding of man." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Sin as Existential Estrangement**
   - Sin is defined as the individual's turning away from authentic existence before God.
   - All humans are in a state of **alienation**, characterized by self-reliance and autonomy.
   - The Fall describes the existential reality that every person lives in sin.
   - Sin is not transmitted biologically but is a universal existential condition.
   - "Sin is not a substance handed down from Adam, but the existential situation of every man." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Original Guilt**
   - Bultmann denies the doctrine of inherited guilt from Adam.
   - Each person is responsible for their own **decision** and **existence** before God.
   - The notion of original sin is reinterpreted as the universality of sinful existence.
   - The Fall is a mythic way of expressing the fact that all are sinners.
   - "The Adam story is not a historical account but a mythological expression of the fact that every man is Adam." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Need for Revelation in Christ**
   - Human beings cannot overcome estrangement through their own efforts.
   - **Revelation** in Christ confronts individuals with the possibility of authentic existence.
   - The consequences of the Fall are overcome only through faith in the kerygma.
   - The proclamation of Christ calls for a radical decision and new self-understanding.
   - "It is only in the encounter with the word of Christ that man is enabled to become truly himself." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Existential Interpretation of Salvation**
   - Salvation is the transition from inauthentic to authentic existence.
   - The consequences of the Fall are reversed not by historical events but by existential transformation.
   - Faith is a personal response to the call of God, not assent to mythological narratives.
   - The New Testament message is existentially true regardless of the historicity of the Fall.
   - "Faith means the possibility of a new existence, liberated from the bondage of the past." (Existence and Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **the Fall** has profoundly shaped modern **existential theology** and biblical interpretation, especially through his method of **demythologization**. His existential reading of sin and estrangement challenged traditional doctrines of **original sin** and influenced generations of theologians grappling with the relationship between myth and history. While controversial among confessional traditions, Bultmann’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relevance of biblical narratives in a modern, post-Enlightenment context.
