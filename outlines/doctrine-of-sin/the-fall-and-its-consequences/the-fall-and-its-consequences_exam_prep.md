- Traditions: Augustinian–patristic hamartiology, medieval scholastic accounts of **concupiscence**, Reformation and Reformed scholastic **federal theology**, modern dialectical theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: realism vs **federal headship**; mediate vs **immediate imputation**; the sinfulness of **concupiscence**; traducianism vs creationism of the soul; the extent of **common grace**.
  - External: Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian denials of inherited guilt and inability; Roman Catholic privation-and-concupiscence models; Eastern ancestral sin without guilt.
  - Contemporary: historical Adam and evolution; divine decree and moral responsibility; structural evil and trauma; pastoral implications for infants and concupiscence.
- Position defended: Reformed federal account with a historical Adam under a real covenant of works, **immediate imputation** of guilt and propagation of corruption, **total depravity** and moral inability under comprehensive **providence**, while denying that God is the author of sin and locating the remedy in union with Christ, the second Adam.

### ESSAY
The Fall and its consequences name the decisive turning of the human race from original righteousness into culpable ruin, such that guilt and corruption are universally ours through Adam’s transgression as our public head. Conceptually, the doctrine requires four joints to be held together: first, a created order originally very good, with man endowed with rectitude and the capacity to obey; second, a positive probation under a law structured as a **covenant of works**, promising life upon perfect obedience and threatening death upon transgression; third, a historical violation by Adam of that covenant as a representative person; fourth, the entailments of that violation for all his posterity in both a judicial and moral register, captured by the Reformed categories of **imputation** of guilt and propagation of corruption, which together explain **original sin** and render the race subject to death, alienation, and **total depravity**. This fourfold structure presses two theoretical tensions: how can God, who by **divine simplicity** and immutability is pure act and goodness, ordain a world in which the Fall infallibly occurs without being the author of sin; and how can another’s act justly count as ours.

Augustine of Hippo (354–430) is the decisive architect of Western hamartiology. In controversies with Pelagius and especially Julian of Eclanum, Augustine articulated the tight relation between Adam’s sin, inherited guilt, and the bondage of the will. Drawing from Romans 5, Psalm 51, and John 3, his On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins and On Nature and Grace insist that Adam’s act is both the root and the cause of our damnable condition. He described the postlapsarian state as a massa perditionis, a condemned mass, not to deny personal agency but to assert its captivity. Methodologically, Augustine is neither a speculative metaphysician nor a mere biblicist; he reasons from Scripture to antipelagian dogma with pastoral urgency, arguing that the practice of infant baptism presupposes their need of remission of sins and therefore their real guilt. The core of his account is that Adam’s first sin stripped him of the donum originalis iustitiae, the gift of original righteousness, thereby introducing disordered love, **concupiscence**, into the human nature which is propagated to offspring. He vacillates in explanatory mode between a realism of human nature such that we were all in Adam and actually sinned in him and a representative logic in which Adam acts for us. What he never relinquishes is the notion that the guilt of Adam’s sin is ours, antecedent to our personal acts, and that our wills, though still voluntary, are no longer capable of returning to God apart from prevenient and effectual grace.

Pelagius, Augustine’s foil, is decisive because his challenge fixes the guardrails of the doctrine. Emphasizing moral exhortation and the justice of God, Pelagius denied that Adam’s sin brought guilt or internal ruin on his posterity. Grace for him is principally law and example, and human freedom remains unimpaired. Julian sharpened these points, contending that infants are born innocent and that **concupiscence** cannot be sin since it is involuntary. Augustine’s response set the course: if there is no inherited guilt or ruin, Christ’s grace reduces to moral instruction and the church’s sacramental life loses its rationale. Councils at Carthage and Ephesus condemned Pelagianism, but Semi-Pelagian tendencies continued to surface, often redefining grace as assistance to an intact will. This external debate frames the Reformed insistence that moral inability is itself a culpable condition, not an excuse.

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) receives less attention in Reformed classrooms than Augustine, yet his account of **original sin** profoundly shaped Western dogma and the Roman Catholic tradition. In the Summa Theologiae he treats original sin as essentially a privation of original justice ordered toward God. This privation disintegrates the harmony of the powers of the soul, so that the lower appetites are no longer ruled by reason. Two features of his analysis proved lasting. First, he refused to locate original sin in a positive substance, preserving the classical doctrine of evil as privation. Second, he described original sin as a habitus, which explains why even after the guilt of original sin is remitted in baptism, the fomes of sin, **concupiscence**, remains as an inclination contrary to reason. Aquinas argues that concupiscence is not sin strictly in the baptized unless consented to, because the privation is healed sacramentally; however, the disordered inclination still moves contrary to the rule of reason and so has an analogical relation to sin. His account protects the integrity of natural faculties and of virtue ethics, while grounding the universality of sin in nature’s propagation and unity. The Council of Trent later codified themes congenial to Aquinas, affirming the transmission of original sin but denying that concupiscence itself is truly and properly sin in the baptized.

John Calvin (1509–1564) inherits Augustinian substance and, through his biblical method, reorients it toward the covenantal and Christological poles that mark Reformed thought. In Institutes 2.1–2.2 and his commentary on Romans 5, Calvin describes **original sin** as a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature diffused into all parts of the soul, accompanied by the forensic reality that Adam’s guilt is ours. He speaks with unembarrassed clarity of **total depravity**, not as a claim that humans are as evil as possible, but as the claim that no faculty is untainted, that the mind is blind, the affections are perverse, and the will is enslaved. Calvin’s method is both exegetical and polemical: he insists that the intention of Paul in Romans 5 is to establish a parallel between the two Adams, such that the only adequate account of our condemnation is in the representation of the one man’s disobedience, else the parallel for our justification by the one man’s obedience collapses. In doing so he moves toward **federal headship** even if later federal scholasticism will systematize it further. For Calvin, **concupiscence** is truly sin because the law demands perfect love and rightly condemns any deviation, whether voluntary in the sense of deliberative consent or arising from disordered inclination. His anthropology supports a compatibilist account of human action: the will chooses according to the strongest inclination, and in sin that inclination is depraved. Calvin is also unflinching on the noetic consequences of sin, the **noetic effects** that cloud reason and pervert wisdom, while still acknowledging by **common grace** that humans achieve civil virtue and cultural goods, so that even Cain builds cities. Reformed confessional theology will take these themes and bind them to a more explicit structure of **federal theology**.

Francis Turretin (1623–1687) as a Reformed scholastic makes explicit what is incipient in Calvin. In Institutes of Elenctic Theology, he defends a real **covenant of works** in which God promised eschatological life upon perfect obedience to Adam as public person. He argues for **immediate imputation**, that the guilt of Adam’s first sin is reckoned to his posterity prior to and the judicial ground of their inherent corruption. This contrasts with mediate imputation, which views corruption as the basis upon which guilt is imputed. Turretin defends the justice of imputation by appeal to divine institution and by showing that representation is intrinsic to political and covenantal life, rooted in God’s appointment of Adam, and necessary to sustain the Pauline parallel in Romans 5. He guards against the inference that imputation makes God the author of sin by distinguishing the forensic imputation of guilt from the efficient causation of sin. Turretin also defends the universality of the Fall’s consequences, addressing the case of infants by insisting that death, which reigns over them, is a penal consequence and therefore presupposes guilt, which only the Adamic relation and its imputation can explain. His work became a template for subsequent Reformed argument against Socinians and Arminians who deny either the covenant of works or the thoroughness of the Fall.

Karl Barth (1886–1968) represents a modern reconstruction and therefore a live external alternative. In the Church Dogmatics he treats Adam not as a historical federal head but as a mythic figure whose story mirrors each person’s existential No to divine grace. Sin is an impossible possibility, a nothingness, that Christ overcomes in his Yes. Barth aims to honor the Christological center and avoid metaphysical speculation about natures and inheritances. He resists the idea of a transferable guilt and relocates the decisive Adam–Christ parallel to a universal Christological determination, in which all are elect in Christ and the verdict of grace is objective prior to subjective faith. The gains of this move are a strong concentration on Christ and a refusal to posit inherited culpability apart from personal act. Its cost is the evaporation of the Pauline forensic structure and the pastoral realities Augustine already saw in infant death and the stranglehold of **concupiscence**. If Adam is everyman, Paul’s tight argument that many were constituted sinners by one man’s disobedience loses its judicial force. A Reformed response insists that the Christological center requires the federal Adam as its necessary counterpart.

Internal debates within the Augustinian and Reformed traditions require careful judgment. The question whether Adam’s guilt is imputed mediately through the inheritance of a corrupted nature or immediately as the first judicial relation to Adam hinges on the Pauline structure. Turretin’s **immediate imputation** better preserves the forensic symmetry with justification by Christ’s righteousness. A second debate concerns the seat of **original sin**. Aquinas emphasizes privation, Reformed theologians stress both privation and positive disorder. The Reformed also differ from post-Tridentine Catholicism by holding that **concupiscence** is truly of the nature of sin, since the law does not merely police consent but commands perfect love with all the heart. This debate now surfaces pastorally in questions about disordered desire apart from consummation. The best Reformed account maintains that even involuntary motions arising from a corrupted nature are sinful, while insisting that degrees of culpability track consent and act. A third debate concerns the origin of the soul, with traducianism offering an explanation for the propagation of corruption and creationism preserving the immediate creation of each soul by God. The Reformed confessions leave room for both, and the doctrine of **federal headship** does not depend upon traducianism.

External debate lines are clearer. Against Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian schemes, Reformed theology asserts **total depravity** and moral inability. The strategic issue is moral agency: does inability excuse? Reformed thought argues that inability is precisely the judgment. To be unable to love God is to be guilty, because the inability is not an external obstacle but our own bent will. Roman Catholic theology affirms original sin and the need for grace, but by refusing to call **concupiscence** sin in the baptized and by placing more weight on infused charity, it risks softening the radicality of the Fall’s ruin. Eastern Orthodoxy often stresses ancestral sin as corruption and death, not inherited guilt. This helpfully highlights death’s cosmic dimension, yet it undercuts Paul’s juridical parallel and the gravity of our plight before God’s law.

The decree and providence of God are the most difficult pressure points in oral examination. If God decrees all that comes to pass, how does he not author sin; if he is good, how can he ordain the Fall. Classical theism insists that God’s decree is simple and eternal, his willing of all things one act, and his relation to creaturely effects is by **secondary causality** and concursus. The Fall falls under comprehensive **providence** not by a bare permission but in a manner that secures its occurrence for a greater display of mercy and justice in Christ. God’s holiness is preserved by the asymmetry between his sustaining and ordering causality and the creature’s deficient, privative cause of sin. The sinfulness of the act arises not from God’s decree but from the creature’s lack of conformity to the rule of God’s law. To the examiner who presses whether Adam could have done otherwise, the answer is layered: in the state of innocency Adam had real posse peccare and posse non peccare, a true freedom of contrary choice; after the Fall man is non posse non peccare, unable not to sin, though still responsible; in glory he will be non posse peccare. This fourfold state keeps human responsibility intact in each state while locating necessity and inability differently. Our discourse here must be **analogical knowledge**, since the mode of God’s willing and causing transcends creaturely categories.

Romans 5 anchors the justice of **imputation**. The two-Adams parallel is not a loose typology but an identity of structures: one man’s one act has race-wide judicial consequences, either condemnation or justification. If we abandon imputation in the first Adam for fear of unfairness, we have also abandoned the logic of justification by the second Adam’s obedience. The examiner may object that representation is unjust, that persons should only be judged for personal acts. But human life is covenantal and corporate by divine design. Fathers and kings act for others. More importantly, God’s appointment of Adam as public person is just because God is just; we do not adjudicate the justice of divine institutions by prior human intuitions. Further, Adam’s representation is not nakedly external. In him we were constituted as a race, and our personal acts ratify our nature’s fallenness. The fit between the federal and the realistic aspects deflects the charge of alien imputation.

Consequences of the Fall, then, must be traced across several planes. Judicially, guilt and condemnation mount; existentially, alienation from God and neighbor ensue; ontologically, the image of God is defaced though not effaced. The corruption primarily affects the heart, that seat of loves and ends, and irradiates reason with **noetic effects** so that the mind suppresses truth in unrighteousness. Socially, structures express and amplify iniquity, so that injustice becomes embedded. Cosmically, the ground is cursed, thorns spring up, and death reigns. The triad of deaths is vital: spiritual death in estrangement from God, physical death as the separation of body and soul, and the second death as eternal judgment. The Fall also recalibrates the civil and cultural sphere. By **common grace**, God restrains evil and grants arts and governance so that human life is tolerable and culture flourishes in measure. This restraint is not saving grace and does not dilute **total depravity**. Its presence explains why image bearers do real good yet need redemption.

Two contemporary debate fronts require direct address. First, the historicity of Adam under the pressure of evolutionary accounts. Population genetics is often said to preclude a single pair progenitor of all humans. Several responses are available, some better than others. The core is theological: Paul’s two-Adams structure presupposes a historical Adam whose act is covenantally decisive. Without that, the architecture of grace totters. Empirically, recent genealogical models show that a universal genealogical ancestor within a relatively short timespan is not only possible but likely, and this weakens the claim that modern science rules out Adam. The Reformed position defended here requires a historical Adam, without specifying the mechanics of his relation to broader biological phenomena beyond affirming that human nature as created is by divine act and that the image of God cannot be reduced to emergent biological complexity. If pressed on apparent animal suffering prior to Adam or the problem of natural evil, the answer returns to **providence** and the distinction between death as part of a wider creational economy and death as penal judicial sentence for humanity, while acknowledging that Scripture speaks of the curse intensifying futility in creation through Adam’s fall.

Second, modern narratives of trauma and structural evil risk dissolving personal culpability. The Fall explains both: persons are responsible agents whose acts can be mitigated by deformation and woundedness, and structures can be unjust precisely because sinful persons create and sustain them. Reformed hamartiology deftly includes both without collapsing guilt into pathology or dismissing the real harm of the world’s brokenness. The examiner may ask whether moral inability should then be judged less culpable. The answer is no, because the inability is sui generis moral and consists in irrational enmity against God, not in the victimhood of a passive patient.

The doctrine’s coherence across loci matters for Westminster examiners. Christology and soteriology are shaped by hamartiology. If Adam’s act condemns many, only a second Adam can save; hence the active and passive obedience of Christ, his federal headship of the new humanity, and **imputation** of his righteousness are not optional corollaries but the positive counterpoise to the Fall. Ecclesiology and sacramentology follow: baptism is sign and seal of the remission of sins and regeneration, not a mere rite of moral enlistment. Sanctification presupposes that **concupiscence** remains and must be mortified, even while justification declares the ungodly righteous by **imputed** righteousness. Eschatology presumes that only a redeemed cosmos can answer the cosmic ruin the Fall wrought. Anthropology and ethics require a realist assessment of human nature in culture, marriage, and politics, without utopian optimism. Law and gospel must be distinguished: the law’s condemning power manifests sin; the gospel’s vivifying word creates new obedience by the Spirit.

Finally, one returns to God. The Fall does not embarrass **divine simplicity** or sovereignty; rather, it reveals in history the depth of the divine wisdom that orders all things to the manifestation of mercy and justice. It is neither a surprise to God nor a defeater of the good creation. The lineaments of providence are severe, but the Reformed insist on two asymmetries: God’s causality with respect to sin is not symmetric with the creature’s; and the two Adams are not coequal. The second Adam is greater than the first, and grace superabounds. The doctrine of the Fall is a dark doctrine, yet in Reformed hands it is a luminous piece of the gospel’s architecture. It compellingly accounts for the universality and gravity of human evil, preserves human responsibility, guards God’s holiness, and presses the church to the one place where ruin is reversed: union with Christ by the Spirit. The examiner who asks whether **federal headship** is fair has already asked the wrong question. The right question is whether God has acted in history to rescue those justly condemned in Adam by righteously constituting them righteous in Christ. The answer is the evangelical Yes that outshines the No of Eden. Pastors should preach the Fall as the occasion for this Yes, catechists should teach children the fourfold state, and theologians must jealously defend the Pauline architecture against all reductions. To do so is not to revel in human misery but to magnify the Redeemer.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The Fall is Adam’s historical breach of the **covenant of works** as public head, entailing the **immediate imputation** of guilt and the propagation of corruption to all his posterity, producing **total depravity**, death, and alienation under comprehensive **providence**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: inherited guilt and bondage of will; anti-Pelagian polemic grounded in Romans 5 and infant baptism.
  - Pelagius: denial of inherited guilt and inability; grace as law and example; condemned yet enduring as a foil.
  - Aquinas: **original sin** as privation of original justice, **concupiscence** as fomes remaining; shaped Roman Catholic trajectory.
  - Calvin: exegetical-covenantal account of **total depravity**, real **imputation**, and the sinfulness of concupiscence; compatibilist freedom.
  - Turretin: **federal theology** explicit; **covenant of works** and **immediate imputation** defended; infants and justice of representation.
  - Barth: Adam as everyman; rejection of transferable guilt; Christological reconfiguration that dissolves federal structure.
- Debates:
  - Internal: federal vs realist accounts of transmission; mediate vs **immediate imputation**; is **concupiscence** sin; traducianism vs creationism; scope of **common grace**.
  - External: Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian optimism; Roman Catholic privation model and denial of concupiscence as sin in the baptized; Eastern ancestral sin without guilt.
  - Contemporary: historical Adam and evolution; decree and authorship of sin; structural evil and trauma; pastoral status of infants and disordered desires.
- Defended position: Reformed federal account with a historical Adam under a real **covenant of works**, universal **immediate imputation** of guilt and propagation of corruption, **total depravity** under meticulous **providence** without divine authorship of sin, and salvation solely through union with Christ, the second Adam.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - How is imputation just? By divine appointment of a public person and the Pauline two-Adams parallel that grounds justification in Christ.
  - Does God’s decree make him author of sin? No; God ordains by **secondary causality** and the sinfulness lies in the creature’s privation, not in God’s holy will.
  - Is concupiscence sin? Yes, as contrary to the law’s demand for perfect love, though culpability admits degrees.
  - Must Adam be historical? Yes, to sustain Romans 5’s federal structure and the symmetry of condemnation and justification.
  - How does **common grace** relate to **total depravity**? It restrains evil and enables civil good without healing the moral inability to please God.
