# John Walton (1952– )

John Walton approaches **the Fall** by emphasizing its **ancient Near Eastern context** and the **functional ontology** of Genesis. He argues that the narrative of Genesis 3 is less about the introduction of **sinful nature** or **original guilt** and more about the disruption of **human vocation** and **cosmic order** within God's temple-creation. Walton reframes the consequences of the Fall as the loss of **access to sacred space** and the breakdown of **intended relationships** rather than a metaphysical change in human nature.

- "The Fall is not about how humanity became sinful, but about how humanity lost access to the presence of God." ("The Lost World of Adam and Eve")

## Key Works

- The Lost World of Adam and Eve (2015)
- Genesis (NIV Application Commentary, 2001)
- The Lost World of Genesis One (2009)
- The Lost World of Scripture (with D. Brent Sandy, 2013)
- Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament (2006)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Functional Ontology of Genesis**
    - Genesis 1–3 describes functions and roles, not material origins.
    - The Fall is the loss of function within God’s ordered creation.
    - Human beings are defined by their vocation as God’s image-bearers.
    - The narrative focuses on **order and disorder** rather than substance.
    - "Genesis is more concerned with how things function in God’s world than with what things are made of." (The Lost World of Genesis One)

2. **Sacred Space and Divine Presence**
    - Eden is depicted as a temple, the locus of God’s presence.
    - The Fall results in expulsion from sacred space, not just moral failure.
    - Loss of access to God’s presence is the primary consequence.
    - Restoration is framed as regaining access to sacred space.
    - "The expulsion from Eden is fundamentally about losing access to God’s presence." (The Lost World of Adam and Eve)

3. **Ancient Near Eastern Contextualization**
    - Genesis must be read in light of ancient Near Eastern cosmology.
    - The story of the Fall interacts with, but also subverts, surrounding myths.
    - The serpent and tree motifs have contextual significance.
    - Walton emphasizes the importance of original audience understanding.
    - "We must interpret Genesis as an ancient document, not impose modern questions upon it." (The Lost World of Genesis One)

4. **Non-Literal Adam and Eve**
    - Adam and Eve are archetypes representing humanity.
    - The narrative’s focus is on human identity and vocation.
    - Biological origins are not the primary concern of the text.
    - The Fall’s consequences are corporate and vocational, not genetic.
    - "Adam and Eve are real, but their role is archetypal, not merely individual." (The Lost World of Adam and Eve)

5. **Sin as Disruption of Order**
    - Sin is defined as the disruption of God’s intended order.
    - The Fall introduces disorder into relationships and creation.
    - The consequences are relational, cosmic, and vocational.
    - Redemption is about restoring order and vocation, not just legal status.
    - "Sin in Genesis is about failing to fulfill the role God has given, not just breaking a rule." (The Lost World of Adam and Eve)

## Legacy and Impact

Walton’s work has significantly influenced contemporary **evangelical hermeneutics** by insisting on the importance of **ancient Near Eastern backgrounds** for interpreting Genesis. His functional approach to the Fall challenges traditional readings centered on **original sin** and has sparked ongoing debates about the nature of **humanity’s relationship to God** and the meaning of **redemption**. Walton’s scholarship continues to shape discussions on the intersection of **science, faith, and biblical interpretation**.
