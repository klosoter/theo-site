# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a comprehensive account of **the Fall** rooted in his synthesis of **Augustinian theology** and **Aristotelian philosophy**. He taught that Adam's original **justice** was lost through disobedience, resulting in the transmission of **original sin** and the disordering of human faculties, affecting both **nature** and **grace**.

- "By sinning, man departs from the order of reason and consequently falls away from the order of the divine law." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 109, a. 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I-II, qq. 81–85)
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard (Book II)
- De Malo
- Selected Questions on the Soul

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Justice and Its Loss**
   - Adam and Eve were created in a state of **original justice**, possessing harmony between reason, will, and passions.
   - This state included the **preternatural gifts**: immortality, integrity, and infused knowledge.
   - The Fall resulted in the loss of these gifts, introducing **concupiscence** and mortality.
   - The disordering of human faculties is a direct consequence of the first sin.
   - "Man, by sinning, loses original justice, whereby the will was subject to God." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 85, a. 3)

2. **Nature and Grace after the Fall**
   - Human **nature** remains essentially good but is wounded and weakened by sin.
   - The loss of grace means humans cannot attain supernatural ends without divine assistance.
   - The **fourfold wound**: ignorance, malice, weakness, and concupiscence, afflicts all post-Fall humanity.
   - Grace is necessary for both healing and elevating fallen nature.
   - "Human nature is not altogether corrupted by sin, but is wounded in its natural powers." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 85, a. 1)

3. **Transmission of Original Sin**
   - Original sin is transmitted by **generation**, not imitation, affecting all descendants of Adam.
   - It is a privation of original justice, not a positive stain, but leaves the soul disordered.
   - The transmission is mediated through human nature, not merely the soul.
   - Baptism removes the guilt of original sin but not all its effects.
   - "Original sin is transmitted by way of origin, not by imitation." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 81, a. 1)

4. **The Role of Free Will**
   - Adam’s sin was a misuse of **free will** against God’s command.
   - After the Fall, free will is weakened but not destroyed; humans can perform natural good but not supernatural good without grace.
   - The will is inclined toward sin due to concupiscence.
   - Divine grace restores and perfects free will for spiritual good.
   - "Free-will is not destroyed by sin, but is wounded and weakened." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 85, a. 2)

5. **Cosmic and Social Consequences**
   - The Fall disrupted not only human nature but also the **order of creation**.
   - Suffering, death, and disorder in the world are consequences of human sin.
   - Social relationships are marked by strife and injustice due to the loss of original harmony.
   - Redemption in Christ is necessary to restore both personal and cosmic order.
   - "By the sin of the first parent, not only was human nature corrupted, but also the whole order of the universe was disturbed." (Summa Contra Gentiles, III, ch. 122)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **original sin** and the consequences of the Fall became foundational for later **Roman Catholic theology** and influenced major Protestant thinkers. His careful distinction between **nature** and **grace** shaped debates on human ability, salvation, and anthropology. Aquinas’s integration of philosophical reasoning with biblical exegesis continues to inform contemporary discussions on the effects of sin and the necessity of grace for redemption.
