# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a classic **Reformed doctrine of the Fall**, emphasizing the historical reality of **Adam’s transgression** and its consequences for all humanity. He maintained that the Fall resulted in **original sin**, **total depravity**, and the **imputation of Adam’s guilt** to his descendants, shaping his understanding of human nature and the necessity of **redemption in Christ**.

- "The consequences of Adam’s sin are experienced by all his descendants, because he was the representative of the race." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Reality of the Fall**
    - The Fall is a real, historical event involving Adam and Eve’s disobedience.
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity in the covenant of works.
    - The narrative in Genesis is interpreted as literal and foundational for Christian doctrine.
    - The universality of sin is rooted in this historical act.
    - "The account of the fall, as given in Genesis, is not an allegory, but a plain historical narrative." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Imputation of Adam’s Guilt**
    - Adam’s sin is judicially imputed to all his descendants.
    - This imputation is grounded in the **federal headship** of Adam.
    - All humans are born guilty and liable to punishment because of Adam’s act.
    - The doctrine safeguards the necessity of **justification by faith**.
    - "The sin of Adam, therefore, is the judicial ground of the condemnation of his race." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Original Sin and Total Depravity**
    - Human nature is corrupted as a result of the Fall.
    - All faculties—mind, will, affections—are affected by **original sin**.
    - Humans are incapable of spiritual good apart from divine grace.
    - This depravity is universal and affects every person from conception.
    - "Original sin, therefore, as it exists in the descendants of Adam, consists in the loss of original righteousness, and the corruption of the whole nature." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Transmission of Sin**
    - Sin is transmitted both by **imputation** and by **natural generation**.
    - The corruption of nature is inherited, not merely imitated.
    - The unity of the human race is essential for the transmission of both guilt and corruption.
    - The doctrine upholds the justice of God in condemning all humanity in Adam.
    - "The Scriptures teach that the corruption of nature is derived from Adam, and is propagated from parent to child." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Necessity of Redemption in Christ**
    - The consequences of the Fall make **redemption** absolutely necessary.
    - Only through the **second Adam**, Jesus Christ, can humanity be restored.
    - The work of Christ addresses both guilt and corruption.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to Hodge’s soteriology.
    - "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust articulation of the **doctrine of original sin** and the consequences of the Fall shaped generations of Reformed theology, especially in the American context. His defense of the historicity of Adam and the federal headship model became standard in conservative Presbyterian circles. Hodge’s influence endures in debates over human nature, sin, and the necessity of **redemption**, making his work a touchstone for systematic theology in the Reformed tradition.
