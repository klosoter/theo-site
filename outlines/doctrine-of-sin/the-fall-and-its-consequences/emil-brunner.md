# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **the Fall** as a real, historical event that fundamentally altered the relationship between **God and humanity**, introducing **sin** and **alienation** into the created order. He emphasized the existential consequences of the Fall, arguing that it resulted in a radical distortion of **human nature** and the disruption of **imago Dei**, while still maintaining the possibility of **divine grace** and **responsibility**.

- "The Fall is not merely a mythological event, but the ever-present reality of man's estrangement from God." (Man in Revolt)

## Key Works

- Man in Revolt (Der Mensch im Widerspruch)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter
- The Mediator

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as an Existential Reality**
   - The Fall is not only a past event but an ongoing existential condition affecting every human.
   - Humanity’s alienation from God is both historical and continually re-enacted in personal existence.
   - The Fall expresses the universal reality of **sin** and brokenness.
   - Brunner rejects purely mythological or symbolic interpretations, insisting on its theological seriousness.
   - "The Fall is the story of every man, the drama of human existence." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Distortion of the Imago Dei**
   - The image of God in humanity is not destroyed but radically distorted by the Fall.
   - Human faculties—reason, will, and relationality—are corrupted but not obliterated.
   - The capacity for relationship with God remains, though it is now marked by estrangement.
   - Restoration of the imago Dei is possible only through **divine initiative** and grace.
   - "The image of God is not lost, but perverted and obscured by sin." (Man in Revolt)

3. **Sin as Rebellion and Estrangement**
   - Sin is fundamentally a relational breach—a turning away from God.
   - Brunner defines sin as both guilt and the existential state of separation.
   - The consequences of sin are both personal (inner conflict) and cosmic (disorder in creation).
   - Sin is not merely ignorance or imperfection but active rebellion.
   - "Sin is the self-assertion of man against God, the root of all estrangement." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

4. **Human Responsibility and Freedom**
   - Despite the Fall, humans retain a measure of responsibility and freedom.
   - Brunner rejects deterministic views that would absolve humanity of guilt.
   - The tension between bondage to sin and moral responsibility is central to his anthropology.
   - Divine grace does not override but addresses human freedom and accountability.
   - "Man is both bound and free, responsible even in his lostness." (Man in Revolt)

5. **Necessity of Divine Grace for Restoration**
   - Only God’s initiative can overcome the consequences of the Fall.
   - Grace is not a natural potential within humanity but an act of divine intervention.
   - Reconciliation is possible through **Jesus Christ** as Mediator.
   - The restoration of relationship with God is the heart of redemption.
   - "Only the miracle of grace can heal the rift caused by the Fall." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s interpretation of **the Fall** shaped 20th-century discussions of **sin**, **human nature**, and **grace** within neo-orthodox theology. His existential and relational approach influenced both Protestant and ecumenical dialogues, emphasizing the ongoing relevance of the Fall for understanding human alienation and the need for redemption. While sometimes criticized for his existentialist leanings, Brunner’s work remains a significant resource for those grappling with the depth of human brokenness and the hope of restoration in Christ.
