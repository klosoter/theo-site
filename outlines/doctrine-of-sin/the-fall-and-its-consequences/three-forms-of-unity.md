# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—present a unified Reformed understanding of **the Fall** as a historical event resulting in the universal corruption of **human nature** and the imputation of **original sin**. They emphasize the total depravity of humanity, the loss of original righteousness, and the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation, highlighting the comprehensive consequences of Adam’s transgression for all his descendants.

- "We believe that through the disobedience of Adam original sin is extended to all mankind; which is a corruption of the whole nature and a hereditary disease wherewith even infants in their mother’s womb are infected." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Articles 14–15
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Days 3–5 (Questions 6–13)
- Canons of Dort, Third and Fourth Heads of Doctrine, Articles 1–4
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English edition)
- The Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Adam and the Reality of the Fall**
    - Adam was a real, historical person created in **original righteousness**.
    - The Fall was a concrete event involving Adam’s willful disobedience.
    - This act resulted in the loss of **the image of God** in its true sense (knowledge, righteousness, holiness).
    - The Fall is not myth or allegory but the root of humanity’s present condition.
    - "God created man good and after His own image... but man, by the instigation of the devil... did willfully subject himself to sin." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

2. **Original Sin and Total Depravity**
    - All humans inherit **original sin** from Adam, corrupting every aspect of their being.
    - This depravity is not partial but total, affecting mind, will, and affections.
    - Even infants are included in this corruption from conception.
    - Humanity is incapable of any spiritual good apart from regeneration.
    - "We are so corrupt that we are wholly incapable of doing any good, and inclined to all wickedness." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 8)

3. **Imputation and Guilt**
    - Adam’s guilt is imputed to all his descendants by virtue of **federal headship**.
    - The consequence is both inherited corruption and legal condemnation.
    - The Fall brought about both spiritual death and exposure to God’s wrath.
    - The doctrine underscores the necessity of justification by grace alone.
    - "The guilt of this original sin is imputed, and the corruption of nature conveyed, to all their posterity." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Art. 2)

4. **Loss of Free Will in Spiritual Matters**
    - After the Fall, humans retain natural faculties but have lost **spiritual freedom**.
    - The will is enslaved to sin and cannot turn to God unaided.
    - Any movement toward God must be initiated by **sovereign grace**.
    - The inability is moral, not metaphysical; humans are responsible for their sin.
    - "Without the grace of the regenerating Holy Spirit, they neither will nor can return to God." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Art. 3)

5. **Necessity of Redemption and Regeneration**
    - The consequences of the Fall make **redemption in Christ** absolutely necessary.
    - Regeneration is the work of the Holy Spirit, restoring what was lost in Adam.
    - Salvation is wholly of grace, not of human merit or effort.
    - The confessions point to Christ as the only remedy for the Fall’s effects.
    - "Unless we are regenerated by the Spirit of God, we are wholly incapable of entering the kingdom of God." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 8)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have decisively shaped the Reformed understanding of **sin, depravity, and grace**, providing a confessional foundation for doctrines of the Fall and its consequences. Their clear articulation of **original sin** and the necessity of **sovereign grace** continues to inform Reformed churches and theological education worldwide. These confessions remain central in debates over anthropology, soteriology, and the nature of human freedom after the Fall.
