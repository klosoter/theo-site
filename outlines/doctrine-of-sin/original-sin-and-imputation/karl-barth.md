# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically reinterpreted the doctrine of **original sin** and **imputation** within his broader **Christocentric** framework. Rejecting both the traditional Reformed and Roman Catholic formulations, Barth insisted that **humanity’s solidarity in sin** is inseparable from its solidarity in **Jesus Christ**, who alone is the true subject of both judgment and reconciliation.

- "Adam is not the first man, but the first sinner, and as such the representative of all men." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Reinterpretation of Original Sin**
    - Original sin is understood only in light of **Jesus Christ** as the true human.
    - Adam’s role is typological, not ontological; he represents the universal sinner.
    - Humanity’s fallenness is real but always already addressed in Christ.
    - Sin is not a metaphysical inheritance but a relational rupture healed in Christ.
    "Adam is the figure of the One who was to come, and only in the light of Christ can Adam be known." (CD IV/1)

2. **Rejection of Federal Imputation**
    - Barth denies the traditional **imputation** of Adam’s guilt to all humanity.
    - Imputation is not a legal transfer but a reality grounded in Christ’s work.
    - The solidarity of humanity in sin is existential, not juridical.
    - Christ’s obedience, not Adam’s disobedience, is determinative for humanity.
    "The doctrine of imputation is to be understood as the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, not Adam’s sin." (CD IV/1)

3. **Sin as Existential, Not Substantial**
    - Sin is not a substance or inherited trait but a universal existential condition.
    - All are sinners because all act in Adam’s pattern, not by biological descent.
    - The universality of sin is a theological, not a biological, reality.
    - The focus is on the act and decision of sin, not on an ontological corruption.
    "Sin is not a thing, but an act, a decision, a relation." (CD IV/1)

4. **Universal Scope of Christ’s Work**
    - Christ’s atonement is objectively for all, addressing the problem of original sin.
    - The new humanity is constituted in Christ, not in Adam.
    - The universality of sin is matched by the universality of grace.
    - The old humanity is judged and reconciled in the one act of Christ.
    "In Christ, all men are judged and all men are reconciled." (CD IV/1)

5. **Doctrine of Election and Solidarity**
    - Election is the foundation for understanding human solidarity in sin and grace.
    - Christ is both the electing God and the elected man.
    - Humanity’s destiny is determined in Christ, not in Adam.
    - The doctrine of election reframes the meaning of imputation and original sin.
    "Jesus Christ is both the Judge and the Judged in our place." (CD II/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s reconfiguration of **original sin** and **imputation** profoundly challenged both Reformed and Catholic traditions, shifting the focus from Adamic guilt to **Christ’s representative work**. His approach has influenced modern theology’s understanding of **solidarity**, **election**, and the universality of grace. While controversial, Barth’s Christocentric reading continues to provoke debate and inspire theologians seeking to articulate the relationship between sin, humanity, and redemption.
