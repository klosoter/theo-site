# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **original sin** and **imputation** through the lens of religious consciousness and the communal nature of human existence. He rejected traditional notions of **federal headship** and **forensic guilt**, instead emphasizing the universal state of **sinfulness** as a disruption of the God-consciousness shared by all humanity.

- "Sin is not a matter of individual acts, but of the state of the human race as a whole." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as a Universal State, Not a Legal Guilt**
    - Original sin is the universal condition of estrangement from God, not a transmitted legal guilt.
    - All humans share in a common **God-consciousness** that is disrupted by sin.
    - Sin is understood as a lack or privation of the divine image, not an inherited moral stain.
    - The focus is on the existential reality of sinfulness rather than on Adam’s historical act.
    - "The doctrine of original sin expresses the universality of sin, not its imputation." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Forensic Imputation**
    - Schleiermacher denies that Adam’s guilt is legally imputed to his descendants.
    - Imputation is reinterpreted as the sharing of a sinful condition, not a judicial transfer.
    - The solidarity of the human race is emphasized over legal categories.
    - Christ’s work is not primarily a matter of legal substitution, but of restoring God-consciousness.
    - "Imputation is not a matter of legal fiction, but of real participation in a common state." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Corporate Personality and Solidarity**
    - Humanity is viewed as a corporate whole, not merely as isolated individuals.
    - Sin is propagated through the interconnectedness of human existence.
    - The concept of **corporate personality** replaces federal headship.
    - Redemption involves the transformation of the communal human condition.
    - "The race is a unity, and sin is the disruption of that unity in relation to God." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Christ as the New Principle of God-Consciousness**
    - Christ is the only one in whom the God-consciousness is fully realized.
    - Redemption is the communication of Christ’s God-consciousness to believers.
    - The work of Christ undoes the universal state of sin, not merely its legal consequences.
    - Imputation of Christ’s righteousness is understood as participation in his life, not a forensic declaration.
    - "In Christ, the divine life is restored to humanity, overcoming the state of sin." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Sin and Grace as Existential Realities**
    - Sin and grace are experienced realities, not merely doctrinal abstractions.
    - The experience of grace is the restoration of the God-consciousness lost in sin.
    - The church mediates this restoration through the life of the Christian community.
    - The focus is on the transformation of the self and community, not on legal status before God.
    - "Grace is the new life of God-consciousness overcoming the universal state of sin." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **original sin** and **imputation** profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology, shifting the focus from legal categories to existential and communal realities. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** and the corporate nature of sin influenced later liberal and existential theologians. While his views were controversial among confessional Reformed and Lutheran traditions, they opened new avenues for understanding sin, redemption, and the human condition in the context of modernity.
