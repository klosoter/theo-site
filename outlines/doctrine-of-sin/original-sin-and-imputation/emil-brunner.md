# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **original sin** and **imputation** through a dialectical theology that emphasized the existential reality of human estrangement from God rather than a strictly inherited **guilt** or forensic transfer of **Adam’s sin**. He rejected the classic **federal** and **realist** views of imputation, instead focusing on the relational and personal dimensions of sin’s transmission and its impact on human freedom and responsibility.

- "Sin is not a substance which can be handed down from one to another, but a relationship which is broken and which, as such, is transmitted." (Man in Revolt)

## Key Works

- Man in Revolt (Der Mensch im Widerspruch)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. 2)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Existential Condition**
   - Sin is fundamentally a broken relationship with God, not a biological or metaphysical inheritance.
   - Every human is born into a state of estrangement, which shapes personal existence from the outset.
   - The universality of sin is explained by the solidarity of humanity, not by a forensic imputation.
   - The existential reality of sin is more significant than its legal transmission.
   - "Original sin is the universal fact of man's rebellion against God, not a hereditary stain." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Rejection of Forensic Imputation**
   - Brunner denies that Adam’s guilt is legally transferred to his descendants.
   - He critiques the **federal theology** for its juridical and impersonal character.
   - Imputation is seen as a relational reality, not a legal fiction.
   - The focus is on personal responsibility rather than inherited guilt.
   - "The idea of a legal imputation of Adam’s sin to his descendants is foreign to the biblical witness." (Man in Revolt)

3. **Solidarity of Humanity in Sin**
   - All humans participate in Adam’s fall through existential solidarity, not biological descent.
   - Sin is transmitted through the human condition, not through physical generation.
   - The brokenness of the human will is universal, but each person is responsible for their own sin.
   - The doctrine highlights the communal and relational aspects of human existence.
   - "We are all involved in Adam’s fall because we are all part of the same human story." (The Mediator)

4. **Christ as the New Adam**
   - Brunner affirms that Christ’s work addresses the existential condition of sin.
   - Redemption is not merely a reversal of forensic guilt but a restoration of relationship.
   - Christ’s obedience inaugurates a new humanity, offering reconciliation.
   - The concept of **vicarious representation** replaces strict imputation.
   - "In Christ, the broken relationship is restored, and the new humanity is established." (The Mediator)

5. **Human Freedom and Responsibility**
   - Despite the universality of sin, Brunner maintains that each person is responsible for their own rebellion.
   - He rejects deterministic or mechanistic accounts of sin’s transmission.
   - The doctrine of original sin must preserve genuine human freedom and accountability.
   - The existential decision for or against God remains central.
   - "Sin is always my sin, even though it is the sin of all." (Man in Revolt)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **original sin** and **imputation** significantly influenced 20th-century Protestant theology by shifting the focus from legal categories to existential and relational realities. His critique of **forensic imputation** and emphasis on the broken relationship with God challenged both traditional Reformed and Roman Catholic formulations. Brunner’s theology contributed to ongoing debates about human freedom, responsibility, and the nature of sin, leaving a lasting mark on neo-orthodox and existential theological discussions.
