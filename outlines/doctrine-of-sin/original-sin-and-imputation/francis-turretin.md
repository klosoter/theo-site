# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of **original sin** and its **imputation** within the Reformed scholastic tradition. He maintained that Adam’s first transgression is both the **imputed guilt** and the **corruption of nature** inherited by all humanity, grounding his arguments in federal headship and the **covenant of works**. Turretin rigorously defended the necessity and justice of **imputation** against Socinian and Roman Catholic objections.

- "The sin of Adam is imputed to us, not as to its act, but as to its guilt and consequent punishment." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), especially Vol. 1, Topics 9–10
- The Doctrine of Original Sin (sections within Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem van Asselt, ed.)
- Francis Turretin: Theologian of the Protestant Reformed Tradition (secondary: James T. Dennison, Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Both Guilt and Corruption**
   - Original sin consists of both the **imputed guilt** of Adam’s sin and the inherent **corruption** of human nature.
   - The corruption is not merely a privation but a positive inclination toward evil.
   - All humans are born under this twofold aspect due to Adam’s federal headship.
   - Turretin distinguishes between the **imputation** of guilt and the propagation of corruption.
   - "Original sin is twofold: the imputation of Adam’s first sin and the inherent depravity of our nature." (Institutes)

2. **Federal Headship and Covenant of Works**
   - Adam acted as the **representative head** of all humanity in the covenant of works.
   - The consequences of Adam’s disobedience are legally and justly transferred to his posterity.
   - This federal arrangement is the basis for the **imputation** of Adam’s guilt.
   - Turretin defends the justice of this arrangement against charges of arbitrariness.
   - "Adam was constituted the federal head of the human race, so that his act was reckoned as ours." (Institutes)

3. **Imputation is Forensic, Not Realist**
   - Imputation refers to the legal reckoning of guilt, not the infusion or transmission of Adam’s act itself.
   - Turretin rejects the notion that Adam’s actual act is physically or metaphysically transferred.
   - The forensic nature of imputation preserves both divine justice and human responsibility.
   - This distinction is crucial for defending the Reformed doctrine against Roman Catholic and Socinian critiques.
   - "Imputation is not a transfusion of the act, but a reckoning of guilt." (Institutes)

4. **Propagation of Corruption by Generation**
   - The corruption of nature is propagated by natural generation, not by immediate creation.
   - Turretin affirms that the soul is created pure, but united to a corrupted nature, it becomes depraved.
   - This avoids implicating God as the author of sin while explaining the universality of depravity.
   - The propagation of corruption is inseparable from the imputation of guilt.
   - "The soul is created by God, but as soon as united to the body, it is infected by original sin." (Institutes)

5. **Necessity of Imputation for the Gospel**
   - The doctrine of **imputation** undergirds the parallel imputation of Christ’s righteousness in justification.
   - Denial of Adamic imputation undermines the logic of the gospel and the work of Christ as the second Adam.
   - Turretin insists that only those who accept the imputation of original sin can consistently affirm justification by faith alone.
   - The symmetry between Adam and Christ is central to Turretin’s soteriology.
   - "As Adam’s sin is imputed to us, so Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of **original sin** and **imputation** became a standard for later Reformed orthodoxy, shaping confessional documents and theological education. His careful distinctions between **guilt** and **corruption**, and his defense of **federal headship**, provided a bulwark against both Roman Catholic and Socinian critiques. Turretin’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of **covenant theology** and the doctrine of justification, marking him as a pivotal figure in the development of Reformed systematic theology.
