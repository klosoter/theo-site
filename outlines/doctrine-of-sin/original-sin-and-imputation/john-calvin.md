# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin taught that **original sin** is the inherited corruption and depravity of human nature resulting from Adam’s first transgression, which renders all people guilty and enslaved to sin. He affirmed the **imputation** of Adam’s guilt to all his descendants, grounding this in the federal headship of Adam and the unity of the human race, and paralleled this with the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** to believers. Calvin’s doctrine underscores the necessity of **regeneration** and **justification by faith** due to humanity’s total inability.

- "Original sin, therefore, appears to be a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature, diffused through all the parts of the soul, which first makes us liable to God’s wrath, then also brings forth in us those works which Scripture calls works of the flesh." (Institutes 2.1.8)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Inherited Corruption**
    - All humans inherit a corrupt nature from Adam, not merely by imitation but by propagation.
    - This corruption affects the whole person: intellect, will, and affections.
    - Original sin is both the absence of original righteousness and the presence of positive evil.
    - The universality of sin demonstrates the solidarity of the human race in Adam.
    - "We are so vitiated and perverted in every part of our nature that by this great corruption we stand justly condemned and convicted before God." (Institutes 2.1.9)

2. **Imputation of Adam’s Guilt**
    - Adam acted as the federal head and representative of all humanity.
    - Adam’s guilt is legally imputed to all his descendants at conception.
    - This imputation is the basis for the condemnation of all people apart from Christ.
    - Calvin distinguishes between the propagation of corruption and the imputation of guilt, but affirms both.
    - "We are not corrupted by acquired wickedness, but bring an innate corruption from the very womb." (Institutes 2.1.5)

3. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - Human nature is so corrupted that people are incapable of any spiritual good.
    - The will is in bondage to sin and cannot turn to God apart from grace.
    - Even the best human works are tainted by sin and cannot merit favor with God.
    - This depravity necessitates divine intervention for salvation.
    - "Man by nature is enslaved to sin, so that his will is not free to choose the good." (Institutes 2.2.26)

4. **Parallel between Adam and Christ**
    - Calvin draws a parallel between the imputation of Adam’s sin and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
    - Just as Adam’s act brings condemnation, Christ’s obedience brings justification.
    - The federal headship principle underlies both condemnation in Adam and salvation in Christ.
    - This parallel is especially developed in Calvin’s exegesis of Romans 5.
    - "As by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." (Commentary on Romans 5:19)

5. **Necessity of Regeneration and Justification**
    - Because of original sin and imputed guilt, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is essential.
    - Justification is possible only through the imputed righteousness of Christ, received by faith.
    - Human effort or merit cannot overcome the effects of original sin.
    - The gospel addresses both the corruption and the guilt inherited from Adam.
    - "We must be born again, because by nature we are children of wrath and dead in sins." (Commentary on Ephesians 2:3)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of **original sin and imputation** profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition, influencing confessional standards such as the Westminster Confession of Faith. His clear articulation of **federal headship** and the necessity of **regeneration** became foundational for later Protestant theology. Calvin’s emphasis on the depth of human depravity and the graciousness of divine salvation continues to inform contemporary discussions on sin, grace, and justification.
