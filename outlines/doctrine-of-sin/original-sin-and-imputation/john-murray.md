# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a robust defense of the **doctrine of original sin** and the **imputation of Adam’s guilt** within the Reformed tradition. He emphasized the **federal headship** of Adam and Christ, arguing that the **forensic** aspect of imputation is essential for understanding both human depravity and the grounds of justification.

- "The sin of Adam is the judicial ground of the condemnation of all, and this is the doctrine of the imputation of Adam’s first sin." ("The Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

## Key Works

- "The Imputation of Adam’s Sin" (1943)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT, 1959–1965)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray," Vol. 2: Systematic Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as Federal Head**
    - Adam represented all humanity in the **covenant of works**.
    - His act of disobedience is reckoned as the act of all his posterity.
    - The **solidarity** of the human race with Adam is both natural and judicial.
    - This headship is the basis for the imputation of sin and guilt.
    - "The relation of Adam to his posterity is not simply that of father to children but of representative to those whom he represents." ("The Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

2. **Imputation is Forensic**
    - Imputation involves a **legal reckoning** rather than a transfer of moral quality.
    - The guilt of Adam’s first sin is judicially reckoned to all his descendants.
    - This forensic imputation is parallel to the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to believers.
    - Denial of forensic imputation undermines the doctrine of justification.
    - "Imputation is not infusion; it is not something wrought in us or done by us, but something reckoned to us." ("The Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

3. **Original Sin as Depravity and Guilt**
    - Original sin consists of both **corruption of nature** and **imputed guilt**.
    - All humans are born with a depraved nature as a result of Adam’s fall.
    - The imputation of Adam’s sin precedes and grounds the transmission of depravity.
    - Both aspects are necessary for a full account of human sinfulness.
    - "The depravity of our nature is the penal consequence of Adam’s sin and the imputation of that sin." ("The Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

4. **Parallelism of Adam and Christ**
    - The structure of **Romans 5** establishes a parallel between Adam’s disobedience and Christ’s obedience.
    - Just as Adam’s act is imputed to all, so Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers.
    - The analogy is essential for understanding **justification by faith**.
    - The parallelism underscores the necessity of both imputation and union with Christ.
    - "The parallel between Adam and Christ is the key to Paul’s doctrine of imputation." ("The Epistle to the Romans")

5. **Necessity of Imputation for the Gospel**
    - Without imputation, the **doctrine of justification** loses its foundation.
    - The gospel depends on the reality of both the imputation of sin and righteousness.
    - Imputation safeguards the **grace** and **objectivity** of salvation.
    - Any weakening of imputation leads to a moralistic or subjective gospel.
    - "The denial of the imputation of Adam’s sin is the prelude to the denial of the imputation of Christ’s righteousness." ("The Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s rigorous defense of **federal theology** and forensic imputation has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions of **original sin** and justification. His exegetical work, especially on Romans 5, remains a standard reference for understanding the biblical basis of imputation. By upholding the coherence of Reformed anthropology and soteriology, Murray has influenced generations of theologians and pastors committed to the integrity of the gospel.
