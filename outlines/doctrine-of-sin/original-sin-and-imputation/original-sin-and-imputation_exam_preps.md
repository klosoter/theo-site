### ESSAY
Original sin and imputation together pose a concentrated test of one’s commitments about God, humanity, and salvation. At stake is whether we can confess, with Paul, that in Adam all die and in Christ shall all be made alive in a manner that is both theologically coherent and morally defensible. I will defend a classic Reformed account in which Adam, as divinely appointed federal head of the human race, sins on our behalf in such a way that his guilt is immediately imputed to his posterity and his corruption is communicated to them by generation. On this basis, justification by the **imputed righteousness** of Christ as second Adam becomes not an arbitrary legal fiction but the gracious inversion of the very mode by which we became sinners.

Any robust account must begin by distinguishing several elements usually conflated. First, there is the state of **original righteousness**, in which Adam was created upright, endowed with rectitude of will and ordered affections. Second, there is the historical first sin of Adam, a transgression of a positive divine command. Third, there is **original guilt**, a judicial liability to condemnation arising not from our personal acts but from our relation to Adam’s act. Fourth, there is **original corruption**, the inherent disorder, concupiscence, and bias toward sin that pervades our nature from conception. The doctrine of original sin affirms that we are born both guilty and corrupted in Adam; the doctrine of imputation explains the judicial mechanism by which Adam’s and Christ’s acts are counted to others.

The conceptual nerve of the doctrine is representation. Are there divinely instituted relations by which the act of one may be truly and justly reckoned as the act of many? The Reformed answer is yes, anchored in the biblical parallel between Adam and Christ in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15. Yet both historically and conceptually this answer has been contested. To see why the Reformed position is not an outlier but the crystallization of a long trajectory we must move through key figures: Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and Edwards.

Augustine of Hippo is the decisive architect. Under pressure from Pelagius and his followers, Augustine had to decide whether sin originates purely from individual choice or whether there is a deeper solidarity. Pelagius held that Adam was merely a bad example, that each soul is created morally neutral, and that grace is chiefly external assistance. Augustine, interpreting Romans 5, especially the phrase “in quo omnes peccaverunt” where the Vulgate rendered “in whom all sinned,” concluded that all sinned in Adam in a sense stronger than imitation. For him, Adam was the head and root of humanity. From him we receive both the privation of original righteousness and a positive inclination to evil.

Augustine’s conceptual move was twofold. First, he understood human nature as a common reality numerically multiplied in individuals yet maintaining a kind of unity. This permitted him to say that when Adam’s will turned from God, the human nature common to all was vitiated. Second, he connected this to divine justice: because all humanity was in Adam as its origin, God rightly judges Adam’s sin as involving his posterity. While Augustine did not develop a fully explicit **federal theology**, the seeds are present. Adam is more than biological progenitor; he is a public person. Augustine’s insistence on inherited guilt and concupiscence was codified in the Western church and condemned Pelagian and semi-Pelagian denials. However, he left unresolved the precise mode of transmission. His language alternates between the language of nature and the language of solidarity, preparing later debates over whether original sin is principally the privation of grace, a positive habit of evil, or a combination.

Thomas Aquinas receives Augustine but reframes him within a more explicit metaphysical account of nature and grace. For Aquinas, original sin is formally the privation of original justice, which was a supernatural gift harmonizing the human faculties under God. Materially, it is concupiscence, the resultant disorder of the lower powers no longer rightly governed by reason and charity. Crucially, he roots original sin in the unity of human nature. There is, he argues, numerically one human nature multiplied in individuals; Adam was given gifts not merely for his private good but for this nature. When he sinned, he lost original justice for the nature as such. Hence we are born without that ordering and thus under the guilt of Adam’s sin as belonging to the nature in which we participate.

Aquinas stops short of a full federal or covenantal account and does not speak of **immediate imputation** as Reformed theologians would. Yet he affirms that Adam’s sin is ours not only effectively but in some sense formally. He writes that original sin is the sin of the nature, not of the person, yet every person contracting that nature is truly a sinner and subject to guilt and punishment. This is important in dialogue with Roman Catholic teaching codified at Trent, which, while accepting original sin and its guilt, resists calling concupiscence sin in the strict sense and rejects the Reformed notion that imputed guilt precedes inherent corruption as logically primary. An examiner might press: does Aquinas give you enough to ground the Reformed view? The answer is that he supplies a robust account of **solidarity in nature** but lacks the federal-legal dimension drawn more directly from Romans 5. Reformed theology will intensify, not abandon, this Thomistic insight by insisting that nature-unity alone does not explain Paul’s Adam–Christ parallel; a covenantal headship is required.

Martin Luther stands at a crossing point. For Luther, original sin is not a mere defect but “the deepest corruption of our nature.” Anti-Pelagian to the core, he radicalizes Augustine’s view of the will’s bondage. Yet Luther’s decisive contribution is not the metaphysical analysis of how sin is transmitted but the soteriological sharpening of **forensic justification** over against all forms of inherent righteousness. Because humans are totally depraved in Adam, they cannot contribute anything to their justification; they must be declared righteous by an alien righteousness. This forensic accent heightens the need for a well-grounded account of **imputation**. If Christ’s righteousness is counted to me while I remain inherently sinful, then, analogously, Adam’s sin may be counted to me prior to my personal acts.

Luther does not systematically articulate a doctrine of federal headship; his focus lies more in the existential plight of the sinner and the sufficiency of Christ. But he insists that infants are under sin and condemnation, which presupposes some form of solidarity severer than mere imitation. When examiners ask whether Luther supports the Reformed doctrine, one must answer: he clearly affirms inherited sin and condemnation, yet the fully explicit federal schema is developed more rigorously by later Reformed thinkers, above all Calvin and the federal theologians.

John Calvin is the pivotal Reformation systematizer for our doctrine. In the Institutes, he affirms that original sin consists both in hereditary depravity and in the imputed guilt of Adam. Calvin reads Romans 5 as teaching that Adam’s disobedience is the judicial ground for the condemnation of his descendants, just as Christ’s obedience is the judicial ground for their justification. Here the notion of **federal representation** becomes explicit, even if the technical vocabulary is not yet standardized. Adam is appointed by God as the head and representative of the human race in a **covenant of works**. His probation was not private but public; his success would have meant life and confirmation for his posterity, his failure brought death.

Calvin insists that both aspects, corruption and guilt, are indispensable. Some contemporary proposals try to preserve inherited corruption while discarding imputed guilt on moral grounds, arguing that it is unjust to hold children guilty for another’s act. Calvin would respond that such an objection rests on an illicit individualism. Throughout Scripture, God deals with humanity through corporate heads and households. The condemnation of Achan’s family, the solidarity of Israel in its kings, and supremely the substitutionary obedience of Christ all presuppose that God may appoint one to stand for many. The question is not whether such representation is possible but whether it is wise and just. Calvin’s answer is that the arrangement is both natural and gracious: natural, because we already exist in Adam and share his nature; gracious, because the same representational structure is the only possible basis for our salvation in Christ. To reject Adamic imputation is, by parity of reasoning, to undercut Christic imputation. If I cannot be truly condemned for a sin I did not personally commit, how can I be truly justified by a righteousness I did not personally perform?

Calvin also guards against a merely forensic reduction. Original corruption, he maintains, is not a legal fiction but a pervasive moral disorder affecting intellect, will, and affections. This anchors doctrines of **total depravity** and **inability**. At the same time, he denies that original sin is inherent to human nature as created, lest we implicate God as its author. The corruption is parasitic, a disordering of good powers. This is vital when examiners press the problem of theodicy: if human beings are born corrupt and guilty, how is God not unjust? The Reformed answer, grounded in Calvin, is that our responsibility derives from our real participation in Adam according to a relation God established, and that God’s permissive decree of the fall does not make him the author of sin, since the evil is in the defect of the creature’s will, not in the divine ordination.

Jonathan Edwards represents a later high point, especially in analytic precision. Responding to Enlightenment critics who questioned inherited guilt and to Arminian opponents, Edwards sought to articulate the metaphysical basis of human solidarity. He argues that personal identity through time is grounded not in numerical sameness of substance but in a divinely constituted continuity of consciousness and law-like relation. Extending this, he posits that human beings are united to Adam in such a way that his will was the will of the whole. Edwards even suggests that the idea of an absolutely independent self is a philosophical fiction; all creaturely identity is already dependent and derivative. On this footing, to say that Adam’s sin is imputed to us is not to ascribe to us something alien, but to recognize the mode in which God constituted human existence.

Edwards also develops the distinction between **mediate** and **immediate imputation**. Mediate imputation holds that we are guilty because we are corrupt, and our corrupt nature leads infallibly to personal sin. Immediate imputation holds the reverse: we are corrupt because we are first guilty in Adam. Reformed orthodoxy has generally favored immediate imputation in order to preserve the parallelism with Christ’s righteousness, which is imputed prior to and apart from our inherent renewal. Edwards defends immediate imputation as better capturing Paul’s order in Romans 5, where condemnation and death reign over those who have not yet sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression. Yet he also stresses that imputation is not a bare legal transfer but presupposes a real moral and ontological union, analogous to the believer’s union with Christ. Examiners may press whether this union is arbitrary; Edwards’s answer is that God’s decreeing of the union is itself the most fundamental reality. There is no neutral vantage point from which to judge it unjust; it is part of the very constitution of created moral order.

Having traced these figures, we can locate the key debates. Internally, within the Reformed tradition, there are disputes over the structure of **federal theology**. Some, like Francis Turretin and later Westminster divines, articulate a robust covenant of works with explicit federal headship and immediate imputation. Others, including some twentieth-century Reformed theologians, have been hesitant about the covenant-of-works terminology or have sought to soften immediate imputation in favor of a stronger emphasis on solidarity in nature and history. The stakes are not merely terminological. If one weakens federal headship, the structural analogy between Adam and Christ can collapse into mere typology. My defended position is that classic federal theology best secures the forensic and covenantal contours of Scripture, particularly the two-Adams schema in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15, without erasing the reality of participation and nature-unity.

Externally, Pelagian and semi-Pelagian positions deny or reduce original sin. Pelagianism asserts that Adam harmed only himself, that grace is merely external law and example, and that human will remains neutral. Semi-Pelagianism admits some weakness but maintains that the initial movement toward God is within fallen human capacity. Both are decisively anti-Pauline. Reformed theology insists on **total inability**: we are by nature children of wrath and slaves to sin, incapable of any spiritual good apart from regenerating grace. Roman Catholic theology, especially at Trent, affirms original sin and the necessity of grace yet differs significantly. It teaches that original sin is removed in baptism and tends to describe concupiscence as an inclination that remains but is not strictly sin in the baptized. It resists the Reformed insistence that concupiscence is truly sin and that imputed guilt stands behind inherent corruption even in the ordo of explanation. Eastern Orthodox theology, influenced less by Augustine, often frames the human plight primarily in terms of death and corruption rather than inherited guilt. It emphasizes ancestral sin as mortality and corruption spread from Adam, with a more medicinal and participatory soteriology and less stress on forensic categories. My contention is that while these traditions preserve important truths about participation and healing, they understate the biblical witness to judicial condemnation in Adam and thereby weaken the full depth of Christ’s priestly work as bearing curse.

Contemporary debates come from several directions. First, analytic philosophers of religion question the coherence and justice of **forensic imputation**. They argue that it violates widely held intuitions about moral responsibility: guilt should track personal acts, not relations. The Reformed response is that such intuitions are not ultimate. In human law, representation is pervasive: parents incur liabilities on behalf of children, civic representatives bind citizens, corporate executives act for companies. Scripture reveals that God’s moral order includes divinely appointed representatives whose acts count for many. Once one grants this, the question becomes not whether the scheme is possible but whether it is divinely revealed and coherent. The Adam–Christ parallel, deeply embedded in Pauline theology, is inexplicable without such a structure.

Second, evolutionary accounts of human origins challenge the historical Adam and thus the very substrate of the doctrine. If humanity emerged gradually from a population, what becomes of a single federal head? Some propose a purely symbolic Adam: a literary figure representing universal, inevitable sinfulness. This collapses the covenantal logic of Romans 5, where Paul grounds justification in Christ on the real historical disobedience of one man. If Adam is only mythic, then Christ’s second-Adam role also becomes merely symbolic, undermining **federal representation** and **forensic justification**. A more promising theological response, maintaining historicity, explores models in which God enters into covenant with a historical couple or small group chosen from a larger population, appointing them as representatives. While such models raise exegetical and scientific questions, they preserve the logic that there is at least one real Adamic head whose tested obedience or failure has consequences for all in him. The defended position here is that Christian theology is not free to abandon a real historical Adam without drastically revising central soteriological claims.

Third, there are moral objections focused especially on infants and those lacking developed rational capacity. How is it just for them to be born guilty? The Reformed answer, again, is that our responsibility does not originate in autonomous choice but in our creaturely being in Adam under God’s covenant. We are not first isolated agents later entering relations; we are constituted in relation to God and to Adam from the beginning. Moreover, the Reformed tradition, while affirming that all are conceived in sin, has usually held that elect infants dying in infancy are saved through Christ by sovereign grace, even if the precise mode of their union with Christ is mysterious. This displays that imputation is not a cold legalism but a backdrop to the sheer gratuity of **sovereign election** and **regenerating grace**.

All of this shows why original sin and imputation are not an isolated locus but structurally tied to adjacent doctrines. Deny inherited guilt and corruption, and the necessity of **regeneration** and the radicality of the cross are downplayed. Muffle federal headship, and justification by **imputed righteousness** becomes less intelligible; one is tempted to slide toward purely transformative or participatory views of justification that blur the law–gospel distinction. So examiners will press: is it really worth bearing the philosophical and cultural scandal of original guilt? The answer, in light of Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and Edwards, is that there is no gospel without it. The same divine wisdom that constituted us in Adam has now constituted a new humanity in Christ, the last Adam. If the first arrangement seems severe, the second is superabundantly gracious. Our theology must be ordered not by autonomous moral intuitions but by the Christological telos of **federal theology**: as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Original sin is the hereditary state in which all humans, descending from Adam, lack **original righteousness**, are inherently corrupted in all faculties, and are under **original guilt** because Adam’s first sin is **imputed** to them through God’s appointment of Adam as federal head.
- Decisive figures: Augustine established inherited guilt and corruption over against Pelagius; Aquinas refined this as the loss of original justice in a unified human nature; Luther radicalized depravity and underscored forensic justification; Calvin systematized **federal headship** and immediate imputation; Edwards analytically defended immediate imputation and the metaphysical basis of solidarity.
- Debates: Internal Reformed disputes concern covenant of works, mediate vs immediate imputation, and the nature of **federal theology**; external debates oppose Pelagian and semi-Pelagian denials of inherited guilt, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox minimization of concupiscence as sin, and alternative participation-only models; contemporary debates challenge the justice of **forensic imputation**, the historicity of Adam under evolutionary accounts, and the moral status of infants.
- Defended position: A classic Reformed account in which Adam, as divinely instituted federal head in a covenant of works, represents all humanity such that his sin is immediately imputed as guilt and communicates pervasive corruption, with this structure mirrored and reversed in Christ’s **imputed righteousness** to those united to him by faith.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:  
  - How do you defend the justice of imputing Adam’s sin to us? Answer: God justly appoints Adam as our federal head so that his act is truly ours in covenantal and natural solidarity, the same structure by which Christ’s obedience becomes ours.  
  - Why prefer immediate over mediate imputation? Answer: Because Romans 5 grounds condemnation in Adam’s one act prior to our own corruption and sin, and this best parallels the immediate imputation of Christ’s righteousness.  
  - How does this doctrine relate to Christ’s work? Answer: The Adam–Christ parallel demands that the mode of our becoming sinners by one representative mirrors the mode of our becoming righteous by another.  
  - What about evolutionary accounts and a non-historical Adam? Answer: A purely symbolic Adam undercuts the federal and forensic logic of Romans 5, so theology must retain a real historical head even if models of his relation to broader human populations are nuanced.  
  - Is concupiscence itself sin? Answer: Yes, as disordered desire contrary to God’s law, concupiscence is truly sin and evidence of our **original corruption**, not a morally neutral weakness.
