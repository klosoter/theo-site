# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl rejected traditional doctrines of **original sin** and **imputation**, arguing that such concepts were speculative and incompatible with the ethical focus of **Christian faith**. He emphasized the communal and moral dimensions of sin, viewing it as a disruption of **God’s kingdom** rather than a hereditary guilt transmitted through Adam. For Ritschl, the work of Christ is not about legal imputation but about the restoration of the community to its intended moral purpose.

- "The doctrine of original sin, as commonly understood, is not a necessary presupposition of the Christian faith, but a product of dogmatic speculation." (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation (Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung)
- Instruction in the Christian Religion (Unterricht in der christlichen Religion)
- Theology and Metaphysics (Theologie und Metaphysik)
- Albrecht Ritschl and the Problem of the Historical Jesus (secondary, by H.R. Mackintosh)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Metaphysical Original Sin**
    - Denies that **sin** is transmitted biologically or metaphysically from Adam.
    - Views traditional formulations as speculative and unbiblical.
    - Emphasizes the ethical, not ontological, nature of human estrangement from God.
    - Argues that sin is a matter of personal and communal action, not inherited guilt.
    - "The notion of a hereditary sinfulness is foreign to the spirit of the Gospel." (Justification and Reconciliation)

2. **Critique of Legal Imputation**
    - Rejects the forensic transfer of Adam’s guilt or Christ’s righteousness.
    - Sees **imputation** as a legal fiction incompatible with the ethical aims of Christianity.
    - Emphasizes actual moral transformation over juridical status.
    - Argues that justification is relational, not transactional.
    - "Imputation, as a legal category, cannot express the moral reality of reconciliation." (Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Ethical Community as the Focus of Redemption**
    - Centers the work of Christ on the formation of the **kingdom of God**.
    - Views sin as disruption of community, not individual legal status.
    - Redemption is restoration to ethical fellowship, not removal of inherited guilt.
    - The church is the locus of God’s reconciling work.
    - "The kingdom of God is the end for which Christ works, not the mere absolution of individuals." (Justification and Reconciliation)

4. **Historical Jesus as Normative**
    - Grounds doctrine in the life and teaching of the **historical Jesus**.
    - Rejects speculative dogmas not rooted in Jesus’ ethical message.
    - Emphasizes Jesus’ role as moral exemplar and founder of the community.
    - Doctrine must be accountable to historical-critical study.
    - "The person of Jesus is the revelation of God’s will for the community." (Instruction in the Christian Religion)

5. **Faith as Practical Trust, Not Assent to Dogma**
    - Defines **faith** as trust in God’s fatherly will, not assent to metaphysical propositions.
    - Faith is oriented toward ethical action and communal life.
    - Doctrines like original sin and imputation are secondary to lived trust.
    - The reality of reconciliation is experienced in the life of the community.
    - "Faith is the practical certainty of reconciliation, not the acceptance of dogmatic formulas." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s rejection of **original sin** and **imputation** profoundly shaped the trajectory of liberal Protestant theology, shifting the focus from metaphysical doctrines to ethical and communal concerns. His emphasis on the **kingdom of God** and the historical Jesus influenced later theologians such as Adolf von Harnack and shaped twentieth-century discussions on the nature of sin and salvation. While often criticized by confessional traditions, Ritschl’s work remains a pivotal reference point in debates over the relationship between doctrine, history, and ethics in modern theology.
