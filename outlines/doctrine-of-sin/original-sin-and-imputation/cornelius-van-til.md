# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **original sin** and **imputation** within the framework of **Reformed federal theology**, emphasizing the covenantal relationship between God and humanity. He argued that **Adam’s federal headship** established the basis for the imputation of both guilt and corruption to all his descendants, and he integrated this with his broader commitment to the **antithesis** between Christian and non-Christian thought. Van Til maintained that the doctrine of original sin is not merely a matter of inherited nature but is fundamentally tied to the **representative principle** in covenant theology.

- "The doctrine of original sin and of the imputation of Adam’s guilt is inseparably connected with the doctrine of the covenant." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the **covenantal representative** for all humanity.
    - The guilt of Adam’s first sin is **imputed** to his descendants by virtue of this headship.
    - This federal relationship is foundational for understanding both **original sin** and redemption in Christ.
    - Denial of federal headship undermines the coherence of the gospel.
    - "The whole of mankind is involved in the consequences of Adam’s act because he was their representative." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Organic Unity of the Race**
    - Humanity is not a collection of isolated individuals but an **organic unity**.
    - The transmission of both guilt and corruption is possible because of this unity.
    - The organic and federal aspects are mutually reinforcing, not contradictory.
    - This unity undergirds the **solidarity** of the human race in both sin and salvation.
    - "The race fell in Adam, not as a heap of individuals, but as an organism represented by its head." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Antithesis and Noetic Effects of Sin**
    - **Original sin** affects the whole person, including the mind and reasoning faculties.
    - The **antithesis** between believer and unbeliever is rooted in the reality of original sin.
    - Sin’s noetic effects mean that human knowledge is corrupted apart from grace.
    - The imputation of Adam’s sin explains the universal need for **redemption** and the futility of autonomous thought.
    - "Sin is ethical and epistemological; it affects man’s whole being, including his thinking." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Imputation as a Covenant Principle**
    - Imputation is not arbitrary but grounded in the **covenantal structure** of God’s dealings with humanity.
    - The same principle that accounts for the imputation of Adam’s sin explains the imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
    - This covenantal logic preserves both divine justice and grace.
    - Rejecting imputation undermines the coherence of **substitutionary atonement**.
    - "The principle of representation and imputation is basic to the whole plan of salvation." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Defense Against Non-Reformed Critiques**
    - Van Til defended the Reformed doctrine of original sin and imputation against **Pelagian** and **Arminian** objections.
    - He argued that alternative views fail to account for the universality and depth of human depravity.
    - Non-Reformed positions often collapse into **autonomous humanism**, denying the necessity of grace.
    - The Reformed doctrine alone upholds the radical need for Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "Any weakening of the doctrine of original sin is at the same time a weakening of the doctrine of salvation by grace alone." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **original sin** and **imputation** reinforced the centrality of **covenant theology** in Reformed thought and shaped generations of theologians and apologists. His insistence on the **antithesis** between Christian and non-Christian worldviews highlighted the foundational role of sin in human epistemology and ethics. Van Til’s work continues to influence discussions on the relationship between federal headship, human depravity, and the necessity of Christ’s redemptive work. His legacy endures in the ongoing defense of Reformed orthodoxy against both secular and theological challenges.
