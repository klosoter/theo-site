# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulated a robust doctrine of **original sin** and **imputation** within the classic **Reformed tradition**, emphasizing both the solidarity of humanity in **Adam** and the forensic nature of **guilt**. He maintained that **Adam’s first sin** is imputed to all his descendants, grounding the universality of human depravity and the necessity of **Christ’s imputed righteousness** for salvation.

- "The imputation of Adam’s sin is not an arbitrary act but is grounded in the organic unity of the human race." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- "Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- "Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 2: God and Creation
- "Essays on Religion, Science, and Society"
- John Bolt, "Bavinck on the Christian Life: Following Jesus in Faithful Service"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Corruption and Guilt**
   - Original sin consists of both inherited **corruption** and **forensic guilt**.
   - All humans are born with a depraved nature due to Adam’s first transgression.
   - The guilt of Adam’s sin is judicially imputed to all his descendants.
   - This dual aspect preserves both the ethical and legal dimensions of sin.
   - "Original sin is both guilt and pollution; it is imputed and inherent." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 3)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
   - Adam acted as the **covenant head** of humanity in the **covenant of works**.
   - His disobedience is legally and representatively attributed to all people.
   - The unity of the human race is both organic and judicial.
   - This headship forms the basis for understanding the imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
   - "Adam’s sin is imputed to us because he was our representative head." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 3)

3. **Imputation as Forensic and Real**
   - Imputation is not a legal fiction but grounded in real solidarity.
   - The forensic aspect refers to the judicial reckoning of guilt or righteousness.
   - Imputation applies both to Adam’s sin and to Christ’s righteousness.
   - The reality of imputation is essential for the doctrine of justification.
   - "Imputation is not an external transaction but is rooted in the unity of the human race." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 3)

4. **Necessity of Christ’s Imputed Righteousness**
   - Humanity’s guilt and corruption necessitate a righteousness from outside themselves.
   - Christ, as the second Adam, provides this righteousness through his obedience.
   - Justification is based on the imputation of Christ’s active and passive obedience.
   - This mirrors the imputation of Adam’s sin, maintaining the parallelism of the two Adams.
   - "As Adam’s sin is imputed to us, so Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 3)

5. **Organic and Covenantal Solidarity**
   - Bavinck stresses the organic unity of the human race in Adam.
   - The covenantal structure explains both the transmission and imputation of sin.
   - This solidarity is not merely biological but also spiritual and judicial.
   - The doctrine upholds both individual responsibility and corporate identity.
   - "The human race is a unity both organically and covenantally in Adam." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced articulation of **original sin** and **imputation** has significantly shaped modern Reformed theology, especially in discussions of **federal headship** and the relationship between nature and grace. His emphasis on the organic and covenantal unity of humanity provided a mediating position between individualism and collectivism in theological anthropology. Bavinck’s work continues to influence contemporary debates on sin, justification, and the doctrine of humanity within the broader Reformed tradition.
