# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the doctrine of **original sin** and **imputation** through the lens of existential interpretation, rejecting traditional metaphysical formulations. He emphasized the **mythological** nature of biblical language and sought to reinterpret these doctrines in terms of **authentic existence** and **human solidarity in sin**, rather than inherited guilt or forensic transfer.

- "The idea of original sin as a hereditary defect is mythological and not compatible with the modern view of man." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Original Sin**
   - Interprets biblical language about **sin** and **imputation** as mythological, requiring existential reinterpretation.
   - Rejects the notion of a literal, historical transmission of sin from Adam.
   - Sees **original sin** as a symbol for the universal human condition of estrangement from God.
   - Emphasizes the need to translate ancient concepts into terms meaningful for modern existence.
   - "The Adam story is not a historical account but a myth expressing the universal fact of human existence." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Understanding of Sin**
   - Defines sin as the inauthentic existence of humanity, characterized by self-reliance and alienation from God.
   - Views every person as participating in sin through their own existential choices, not through inherited guilt.
   - Focuses on the individual's confrontation with the call of God in the present.
   - Interprets Pauline language about Adam and Christ in existential, not forensic, categories.
   - "Sin is not a substance but an existential possibility realized in every man." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Forensic Imputation**
   - Denies the traditional Reformed doctrine of the **imputation** of Adam’s guilt to his descendants.
   - Argues that justification and condemnation are not legal transactions but existential realities.
   - Sees the language of imputation as a mythological way of expressing the solidarity of all in sin.
   - Emphasizes personal responsibility rather than inherited status before God.
   - "The concept of imputation is a mythological expression for the fact that all men are in solidarity in sin." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Christ as the New Possibility for Existence**
   - Interprets Christ’s work as opening a new mode of existence, not as a forensic transfer of righteousness.
   - Stresses the existential encounter with Christ as the decisive event for overcoming sin.
   - Sees faith as the acceptance of the new possibility of authentic existence in Christ.
   - Rejects the idea of Christ’s righteousness being imputed to believers in a legal sense.
   - "In Christ, a new existence is made possible, not by imputation but by participation." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Hermeneutical Priority of Kerygma**
   - Prioritizes the proclamation (kerygma) of the gospel as the means by which individuals are confronted with their sinful condition.
   - Argues that doctrines of **original sin** and **imputation** must be understood through the existential impact of the kerygma.
   - Sees the function of these doctrines as awakening self-understanding and the need for decision.
   - Maintains that theological language must be continually reinterpreted for contemporary hearers.
   - "The kerygma does not transmit information about metaphysical realities but calls men to decision." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential reinterpretation of **original sin** and **imputation** profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in the realms of **hermeneutics** and New Testament studies. His approach challenged traditional dogmatic formulations and encouraged a focus on the existential realities underlying biblical language. While his views were controversial, they sparked ongoing debate about the relevance and meaning of classic doctrines in a modern context. Bultmann’s legacy endures in discussions about the relationship between **biblical theology** and contemporary existential concerns.
