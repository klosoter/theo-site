# Pelagius (c. 354–c. 418)

Pelagius rejected the doctrine of **original sin** as inherited guilt or corruption, insisting instead on the **innate moral ability** and **free will** of every human being. He denied the **imputation** of Adam’s sin to his descendants, teaching that each person is born in the same moral state as Adam before the Fall and becomes a sinner only through personal choice.

- "We do not propagate sin, but free will; for we are not begotten as men with sin, but with the possibility of not sinning." (Letter to Demetrias)

## Key Works

- Letter to Demetrias
- Commentary on Romans (fragments)
- Confession of Faith (fragments)
- Augustine, On the Grace of Christ and On Original Sin (as a primary source for Pelagius’s views)
- Robert F. Evans, Pelagius: Inquiries and Reappraisals

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Denial of Original Sin**
    - Adam’s sin affected only himself, not the entire human race.
    - Each person is born morally neutral, without inherited guilt or corruption.
    - Sin enters the world through imitation, not transmission.
    - Baptism is not required to remove original guilt.
    - "Nothing impossible has been commanded by God, for it would be unjust to command what cannot be done." (Letter to Demetrias)

2. **Affirmation of Free Will**
    - Human beings possess the full capacity to choose good or evil.
    - Divine commands presuppose human ability to obey.
    - Grace is primarily external (teaching, example), not an internal transformation.
    - Moral responsibility is grounded in the freedom of the will.
    - "If I ought, I can." (as cited by Augustine, On Nature and Grace)

3. **Rejection of Imputed Guilt**
    - Adam’s guilt is not transferred to his descendants.
    - Each person is judged solely for their own acts.
    - There is no legal or forensic imputation of Adam’s sin.
    - The doctrine of imputation undermines personal responsibility.
    - "No one is born in sin, and no one is condemned for another’s fault." (Commentary on Romans, fragment)

4. **Necessity of Personal Righteousness**
    - Salvation depends on personal obedience and moral effort.
    - Christ’s example and teaching enable, but do not guarantee, righteousness.
    - Forgiveness is available for actual sins, not for an inherited condition.
    - The law and gospel both call for active righteousness.
    - "It is possible for a man to be without sin, and easily keep the commandments of God, if he chooses." (Letter to Demetrias)

5. **Grace as Assistance, Not Transformation**
    - Grace is God’s help through law, teaching, and Christ’s example.
    - Grace does not change human nature or will.
    - Human effort is primary; grace is secondary and external.
    - The role of grace is to instruct and encourage, not to regenerate.
    - "Grace consists in this, that God has created us with free will and given us the law and teaching." (as cited by Augustine, On the Grace of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Pelagius’s denial of **original sin** and **imputation** provoked a major theological controversy, leading to his condemnation at several councils and the development of the doctrine of **total depravity** in the Western church. His views forced the church to clarify the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation and the reality of inherited guilt. Though condemned as heresy, Pelagianism has continued to influence debates on human nature, free will, and moral responsibility throughout Christian history.
