# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **original sin** and **imputation** through the lens of **existential estrangement** and **symbolic interpretation** rather than traditional Reformed categories. For Tillich, **sin** is fundamentally the state of being separated from one's essential being and from God, and **imputation** is not a forensic transaction but a symbol of the universal human condition of alienation.

- "Original sin is not a story of an event which happened 'once upon a time,' but the description of a universal and constantly repeated human situation." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 2")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Existential Estrangement**
    - Sin is the universal condition of **estrangement** from God, self, and others.
    - Original sin describes the existential reality of separation, not a historical act.
    - All humans participate in this estrangement as part of their existence.
    - The doctrine is interpreted symbolically, not literally.
    - "The doctrine of original sin expresses the universality of estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Imputation as Symbolic Representation**
    - Imputation is not a legal or forensic transfer of guilt.
    - It symbolizes the shared condition of **alienation** in humanity.
    - The language of imputation points to the depth of the human predicament.
    - Christ's work addresses the existential state, not a juridical status.
    - "Imputation means the participation of everyone in the universal situation of estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Sin as Unavoidable and Universal**
    - Sin is an unavoidable aspect of the human condition.
    - There is no state of innocence; all are born into estrangement.
    - The universality of sin is a matter of existential reality, not biological inheritance.
    - Human freedom is always exercised within the limits of this estrangement.
    - "There is no moment in which man is not under the conditions of estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Rejection of Literal Adamic Fall**
    - The story of Adam is a mythological symbol, not a historical account.
    - The fall represents the existential situation of every person.
    - The doctrine of original sin is not dependent on a literal first sin.
    - The myth points to the depth and universality of human estrangement.
    - "The fall is not an event in the past, but a description of the human situation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Christ as the New Being**
    - Christ overcomes estrangement and reveals the possibility of **reconciliation**.
    - The work of Christ is existential, restoring unity with God.
    - Justification is the acceptance of the new being, not a change in legal status.
    - The new being in Christ is the answer to the universal condition of sin.
    - "In Christ, the power of estrangement is overcome and the new being is manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **original sin** and **imputation** influenced modern theology by shifting the focus from forensic categories to the existential realities of **estrangement** and reconciliation. His symbolic approach challenged traditional doctrines and opened new avenues for dialogue between theology and philosophy. While controversial among confessional theologians, Tillich’s thought remains a major reference point in discussions of sin, anthropology, and the meaning of salvation in the twentieth century.
