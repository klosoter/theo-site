# Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609)

Jacobus Arminius offered a distinctive account of **original sin** and **imputation** that diverged from strict Reformed orthodoxy. While affirming the reality of **human depravity** due to Adam’s fall, Arminius rejected the notion of the **immediate imputation** of Adam’s guilt, instead emphasizing the **mediate transmission** of corruption and the role of **prevenient grace** in restoring human ability.

- "It cannot be said, with propriety, that all men sinned in Adam, or that the sin of Adam is imputed to all his posterity." (Works of Arminius, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Declaration of Sentiments" (1608)
- "Public Disputations" (especially Disputation XI: On the First Sin of the First Man)
- "Works of James Arminius," trans. Nichols and Bagnall (3 vols.)
- Carl Bangs, "Arminius: A Study in the Dutch Reformation"
- Roger E. Olson, "Arminian Theology: Myths and Realities"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Corruption, Not Guilt**
    - Original sin is primarily the inherited **corruption** of human nature, not the imputed guilt of Adam’s act.
    - All humans are born with a depraved nature that inclines them toward sin.
    - The consequences of Adam’s sin are both spiritual and physical, affecting all his descendants.
    - The guilt of Adam’s transgression is not automatically reckoned to each individual.
    - "The sin of Adam is not imputed to his posterity, until they are made partakers of the same corruption." (Works, Vol. 2)

2. **Rejection of Immediate Imputation**
    - Arminius denies that Adam’s guilt is **immediately imputed** to all humanity.
    - Imputation occurs only when individuals personally consent to sinful acts.
    - The doctrine of immediate imputation is seen as unjust and inconsistent with divine righteousness.
    - He distinguishes between the transmission of a corrupt nature and the imputation of guilt.
    - "God does not impute the sin of Adam to his posterity, except as they are partakers of the same depravity." (Works, Vol. 2)

3. **Mediation of Depravity**
    - The **corruption** of human nature is passed down **mediately** through natural generation.
    - This depravity renders all people incapable of true righteousness apart from grace.
    - The transmission is not a legal imputation but a real, existential condition.
    - Human will is bound by this depravity, necessitating divine intervention.
    - "The propagation of depravity is by natural descent, not by imputation of guilt." (Declaration of Sentiments)

4. **Necessity of Prevenient Grace**
    - **Prevenient grace** is necessary to overcome the effects of original sin.
    - Without this grace, humans cannot will or do any truly good thing.
    - Grace restores the capacity for faith and obedience, making salvation possible.
    - This grace is universally available, counteracting inherited depravity.
    - "No man believes in Christ unless the Father draws him by his preventing grace." (Works, Vol. 2)

5. **Personal Responsibility and Actual Sin**
    - Individuals are held accountable for their own **actual sins**, not Adam’s transgression.
    - Guilt before God arises from personal acts of disobedience.
    - The atonement of Christ is sufficient for all, but applied only to those who believe.
    - The doctrine upholds both the seriousness of sin and the justice of God.
    - "Each man is constituted a sinner by his own act, not by the mere act of Adam." (Works, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Arminius’s views on **original sin** and **imputation** provided the foundation for later **Arminian theology**, especially in its emphasis on **prevenient grace** and human responsibility. His rejection of immediate imputation distinguished his thought from classical Reformed confessions and influenced the development of Wesleyan and Methodist traditions. Arminius’s nuanced approach continues to shape debates on the nature of sin, grace, and human freedom within Protestant theology.
