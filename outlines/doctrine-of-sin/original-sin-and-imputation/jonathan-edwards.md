# Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758)

Jonathan Edwards offered a robust account of **original sin** and its **imputation**, emphasizing the unity of humanity in **Adam** and the justice of divine dealings with the human race. He argued that all humans are constituted sinners by virtue of their **federal union** with Adam, and that **imputed guilt** is both just and necessary for understanding the universality of sin and the need for **redemption in Christ**.

- "The guilt of the sin by which the species first rebelled against God, and broke the covenant with their Maker, is, in the sight of God, truly imputed to all mankind." ("Original Sin")

## Key Works

- Original Sin (1758)
- Freedom of the Will (1754)
- The Great Christian Doctrine of Original Sin Defended (1758)
- The Works of Jonathan Edwards (Yale Edition), esp. Vol. 3: Original Sin
- Jonathan Edwards and the Catholic Vision of Salvation (Gerald R. McDermott)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity’s Federal Union with Adam**
   - Adam acted as the **federal head** of the human race.
   - All humanity is represented in Adam’s first transgression.
   - The consequences of Adam’s sin are justly applied to his posterity.
   - This union grounds the imputation of both guilt and corruption.
   - "God deals with Adam and his posterity as one, according to the constitution established." ("Original Sin")

2. **Imputation of Adam’s Guilt**
   - Adam’s guilt is **imputed** to all his descendants.
   - Imputation is not merely a legal fiction but reflects a real moral connection.
   - The justice of imputation is rooted in the divine constitution of the covenant.
   - Imputation explains the universality of sin and death.
   - "The sin of the apostasy is not theirs merely because God imputes it to them, but it is truly and properly theirs." ("Original Sin")

3. **Inherited Depravity**
   - All humans inherit a **corrupt nature** from Adam.
   - This depravity is both moral and spiritual, affecting the whole person.
   - The transmission of depravity is inseparable from the imputation of guilt.
   - Human inability to do good is a result of this inherited corruption.
   - "All mankind are by nature in a state of total ruin, both with respect to the guilt of sin and the corruption of nature." ("Original Sin")

4. **Necessity of Redemption in Christ**
   - The universality of original sin underscores the necessity of **redemption**.
   - Christ acts as the new federal head for those united to Him by faith.
   - The imputation of Adam’s sin is paralleled by the imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
   - Salvation requires both the removal of guilt and the renewal of nature.
   - "As we are condemned in Adam, so we are justified in Christ." ("Original Sin")

5. **Divine Justice and the Moral Order**
   - God’s justice is not arbitrary but rooted in His **moral government**.
   - The imputation of sin is consistent with divine wisdom and goodness.
   - The structure of original sin reveals the coherence of God’s redemptive plan.
   - The doctrine preserves both the seriousness of sin and the glory of grace.
   - "The wisdom and justice of God in constituting Adam and his posterity as one is manifest in the gospel." ("Original Sin")

## Legacy and Impact

Edwards’s articulation of **original sin** and **imputation** profoundly shaped later Reformed theology, especially in American contexts. His defense of the justice and necessity of imputed guilt provided a bulwark against Enlightenment critiques of inherited sin. Edwards’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on **federal theology**, the nature of human depravity, and the coherence of the gospel. His influence endures in both theological scholarship and the broader Reformed tradition.
