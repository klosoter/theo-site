# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **original sin** is foundational for Western theology, asserting that all humanity inherits both the **guilt** and **corruption** of Adam’s first transgression. He maintains that **imputation** occurs through the unity of the human race in Adam, so that all are born subject to **condemnation** and in need of **divine grace** for salvation.

- "In Adam, all die, so that the condemnation which followed upon one transgression was transmitted to all men." (Enchiridion 46)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, and on the Baptism of Infants
- City of God
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- Against Julian

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Inherited Guilt**
    - Humanity is united in Adam, so his sin is reckoned as the sin of all.
    - All are born with the **guilt** of Adam’s transgression, not merely its consequences.
    - This inherited guilt necessitates **infant baptism** for the remission of sin.
    - The transmission of guilt is both legal and ontological, affecting the very nature of humanity.
    - "The whole mass of condemned humanity is justly condemned through one man." (Enchiridion 106)

2. **Transmission of Sin through Generation**
    - Sin is propagated through natural descent, not merely imitation.
    - The act of procreation itself is tainted by concupiscence, a result of the Fall.
    - Every human, except Christ, is conceived in sin and thus under condemnation.
    - The universality of sin is explained by the solidarity of the human race in Adam.
    - "All men were in that one man, since all men were that one man who fell into sin." (City of God 13.14)

3. **Imputation and Federal Headship**
    - Adam serves as the **federal head** of humanity, representing all his descendants.
    - His act of disobedience is imputed to all, making them liable to death and judgment.
    - This imputation is not based on personal acts but on the unity of the human race in Adam.
    - The justice of God is upheld, since all truly participated in Adam’s sin.
    - "All men at that time were in Adam, so that by his will they fell into damnation." (On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins 3.7)

4. **Necessity of Divine Grace**
    - Human will is enslaved by sin and cannot choose good without **prevenient grace**.
    - Salvation is entirely dependent on God’s initiative and mercy.
    - Grace is both necessary for the remission of original sin and for the renewal of the will.
    - The Pelagian denial of inherited guilt and necessity of grace is vigorously opposed.
    - "No one is delivered from the guilt of original sin except by the grace of the Redeemer." (On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins 1.9)

5. **Role of Baptism in Remission of Original Sin**
    - Baptism is the ordained means for the cleansing of original sin, even in infants.
    - Without baptism, the guilt of original sin remains, resulting in exclusion from the kingdom of God.
    - The sacrament is effective ex opere operato, by virtue of God’s promise.
    - Baptism does not remove concupiscence, but it removes guilt and condemnation.
    - "Infants are baptized for the remission of sins, not for sins of their own doing, but for original sin." (On the Baptism of Infants 5.21)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **original sin** and the doctrine of **imputation** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, influencing both Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. His views provided the theological foundation for later debates on **grace**, **human nature**, and **federal headship**. The Augustinian framework remains central in discussions of sin, anthropology, and the necessity of **redemptive grace**.
