# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches **original sin** and **imputation** through a robustly **Reformed** and **covenantal** lens, emphasizing the historical reality of Adam’s transgression and its consequences for all humanity. He upholds the **federal headship** of Adam, arguing that both the corruption of human nature and the guilt of Adam’s first sin are imputed to his descendants, while also highlighting the parallel imputation of Christ’s righteousness to believers. Poythress integrates **biblical theology** and **systematic theology** to defend the coherence and necessity of these doctrines within the broader framework of **redemptive history**.

- "Adam’s sin is both the origin of our corruption and the judicial ground for our condemnation, just as Christ’s obedience is the ground for our justification." (Inerrancy and Worldview)

## Key Works

- Inerrancy and Worldview: Answering Modern Challenges to the Bible
- The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses
- Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology
- "Romans 5:12–21 and Imputation" (Westminster Theological Journal article)
- Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Federal Headship of Adam**
   - Adam represents all humanity in the **covenant of works**.
   - Adam’s act of disobedience is legally and covenantally attributed to his descendants.
   - The structure of **Romans 5:12–21** is foundational for understanding imputation.
   - The parallel between Adam and Christ is essential for the doctrine of justification.
   - "Adam’s headship is the basis for both the imputation of sin and the possibility of Christ’s imputed righteousness." (Inerrancy and Worldview)

2. **Imputation as a Judicial Reality**
   - Imputation involves the legal reckoning of Adam’s guilt to all people.
   - This is not merely a transmission of corruption but a forensic act.
   - The same principle undergirds the imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
   - Denial of imputation undermines the gospel’s coherence.
   - "Imputation is not a legal fiction, but the very structure of God’s dealings with humanity." (Romans 5:12–21 and Imputation)

3. **Original Sin as Corruption and Guilt**
   - Original sin includes both inherited corruption and imputed guilt.
   - Human nature is radically affected by Adam’s first sin.
   - The universality of sin is explained by this dual aspect.
   - The necessity of regeneration is rooted in this total depravity.
   - "We are not sinners merely by imitation, but by nature and by imputation." (Inerrancy and Worldview)

4. **Christ as the Second Adam**
   - Christ’s obedience is imputed to believers, reversing Adam’s curse.
   - The structure of redemption mirrors the structure of the fall.
   - Justification depends on the reality of both imputations.
   - The unity of redemptive history is seen in the Adam–Christ typology.
   - "The righteousness of Christ is counted as ours, just as Adam’s sin was counted as ours." (Symphonic Theology)

5. **Integration of Biblical and Systematic Theology**
   - Doctrines of sin and imputation must be grounded in exegesis.
   - Biblical theology provides the redemptive-historical context.
   - Systematic theology articulates the logical coherence of these doctrines.
   - Both disciplines are necessary for a faithful articulation of original sin.
   - "Systematic theology and biblical theology together illuminate the depth of our need and the glory of Christ’s provision." (Inerrancy and Worldview)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s work has reinforced the **Reformed doctrine of original sin** and the necessity of imputation within evangelical scholarship. His integration of **biblical theology** and **systematic theology** has provided a model for addressing contemporary challenges to these doctrines. By defending the federal structure of redemptive history, Poythress has contributed to the ongoing relevance of classic Reformed anthropology and soteriology. His writings continue to shape discussions on the coherence and biblical foundations of imputation in the modern theological landscape.
