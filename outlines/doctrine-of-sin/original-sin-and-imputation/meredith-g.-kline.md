# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached **original sin** and **imputation** within the framework of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the significance of the **Adamic administration** and the **federal headship** of Adam. He argued that humanity's guilt and corruption are rooted in Adam's representative role in the **covenant of works**, and that the imputation of Adam's sin is paralleled by the imputation of Christ's righteousness in the **covenant of grace**.

- "The imputation of Adam’s sin to his posterity is the legal consequence of his federal headship in the covenant of works." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Images of the Spirit
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the **covenantal representative** for all humanity in the original covenant.
    - The consequences of Adam’s disobedience are judicially applied to his descendants.
    - This federal arrangement grounds the doctrine of **imputation**.
    - Kline sees this structure as foundational for understanding both condemnation and redemption.
    - "Adam’s probation was not private but public, not individual but corporate." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenant of Works as the Context for Original Sin**
    - The **covenant of works** provides the legal framework for the imputation of Adam’s guilt.
    - Adam’s failure resulted in the loss of original righteousness and the transmission of guilt.
    - The breach of the covenant brought both **forensic** and **moral** consequences.
    - Kline emphasizes the historical reality of the covenantal arrangement in Eden.
    - "The curse of the covenant was visited upon Adam and through him upon all mankind." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Imputation as a Judicial Act**
    - Imputation is a **forensic** transfer, not a physical or biological transmission.
    - The guilt of Adam’s first sin is reckoned to all his descendants by virtue of covenantal solidarity.
    - This legal reckoning is mirrored in the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to believers.
    - Kline distinguishes between the **imputation of guilt** and the **propagation of corruption**.
    - "Imputation is the legal reckoning of another’s act to one’s account." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Parallelism Between Adam and Christ**
    - The structure of **federal headship** is mirrored in the relationship between Christ and the elect.
    - Just as Adam’s act is imputed to all, so Christ’s obedience is imputed to believers.
    - This parallelism undergirds the doctrine of **justification** by faith.
    - Kline stresses the typological and covenantal unity of redemptive history.
    - "The two-Adams schema is the backbone of biblical soteriology." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Original Sin as Both Guilt and Corruption**
    - Original sin involves both the **imputed guilt** of Adam’s transgression and the inherited corruption of nature.
    - Kline maintains the distinction but inseparability of these two aspects.
    - The corruption of human nature is the consequence of the judicial sentence.
    - Redemption addresses both the forensic and moral dimensions of original sin.
    - "The fall brought both condemnation and corruption to Adam’s race." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s robust articulation of **covenant theology** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **original sin** and **imputation**, especially in relation to the structure of redemptive history. His emphasis on the **federal headship** of Adam and Christ provided clarity and continuity between the doctrines of sin and salvation. Kline’s work continues to influence debates on the nature of the covenants and the theological coherence of Reformed soteriology.
