# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **original sin** and **imputation** within a robustly Reformed framework, emphasizing the covenantal and representational aspects of Adam’s role. He affirms the **federal headship of Adam**, the **forensic imputation** of guilt, and the pervasive corruption of human nature, while also highlighting the existential and situational dimensions of sin’s effects.

- "Adam’s sin is imputed to us, not arbitrarily, but because he was our representative in the covenant of works." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2013)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the covenantal representative for all humanity in the **covenant of works**.
    - Adam’s disobedience is legally and relationally attributed to his descendants.
    - This headship grounds the imputation of both guilt and corruption.
    - Frame sees this as a just and biblical structure for understanding human solidarity in sin.
    - "Adam’s headship is the basis for the transmission of both guilt and corruption." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Forensic Imputation of Guilt**
    - The guilt of Adam’s first sin is **imputed** to all his posterity.
    - Imputation is understood as a legal or forensic transfer, not merely a transmission of corruption.
    - This forensic aspect parallels the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to believers.
    - Frame maintains that this is essential for a biblical doctrine of justification and condemnation.
    - "Imputation is a legal matter, not a matter of personal moral character." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Total Depravity and Corruption**
    - All humans inherit a pervasive corruption of nature from Adam.
    - This corruption affects every aspect of human existence: mind, will, and affections.
    - Frame emphasizes the existential and situational dimensions of this depravity.
    - The result is total inability to please God apart from grace.
    - "Original sin is both guilt and corruption, both legal and existential." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Covenantal Structure of Sin and Salvation**
    - Sin and its imputation are best understood within the framework of **covenant theology**.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ (the "two Adams") is central to Frame’s account.
    - The **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace** structure the history of redemption.
    - This framework upholds both divine justice and mercy in God’s dealings with humanity.
    - "The covenantal structure is essential to understanding both the problem of sin and the solution in Christ." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Integration of Normative, Situational, and Existential Perspectives**
    - Frame applies his triperspectivalism to the doctrine of original sin and imputation.
    - The **normative** perspective highlights God’s law and the legal imputation of guilt.
    - The **situational** perspective considers the historical and communal context of sin.
    - The **existential** perspective addresses the personal and psychological effects of corruption.
    - "We must see original sin as a reality that is normative, situational, and existential." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **original sin** and **imputation** has reinforced the classical Reformed understanding while integrating fresh insights from his triperspectival method. His work has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by emphasizing the covenantal and existential dimensions of sin. Frame’s clarity and commitment to biblical authority have made his writings a staple in evangelical and Reformed circles, shaping discussions on anthropology and soteriology for a new generation.
