# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a robust doctrine of **original sin** and its **imputation** to all humanity through Adam as the federal head. They emphasize the transmission of both **guilt** and **corruption** from Adam to his posterity, grounding the necessity of **justification** by faith in Christ’s **imputed righteousness**. This framework shapes the Reformed understanding of human depravity and the means of salvation.

- "They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed, and the same death in sin and corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity..." (Westminster Confession of Faith 6.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 6, 7, 11)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 22–29, 149–152)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 13–19)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as Federal Head**
    - Adam represented all humanity in the **covenant of works**.
    - His act of disobedience is legally and morally attributed to his descendants.
    - The **imputation** of Adam’s guilt is foundational for understanding original sin.
    - This federal relationship grounds the parallel imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
    - "The covenant being made with Adam, not only for himself, but for his posterity..." (WCF 7.2)

2. **Imputation of Guilt**
    - All humans are counted guilty before God due to Adam’s first sin.
    - **Imputation** is a legal reckoning, not a personal act of each individual.
    - This guilt precedes and grounds the corruption of nature.
    - The doctrine safeguards the necessity of **justification** by grace.
    - "The guilt of this sin was imputed..." (WCF 6.3)

3. **Transmission of Corruption**
    - Along with guilt, a corrupt nature is conveyed to all Adam’s descendants.
    - This corruption is total, affecting every faculty of soul and body.
    - The **Shorter Catechism** describes this as “original righteousness lost.”
    - All actual sins proceed from this original corruption.
    - "From this original corruption...proceed all actual transgressions." (WCF 6.4)

4. **Necessity of Regeneration**
    - Fallen humanity is utterly unable to recover itself or please God.
    - Regeneration by the **Holy Spirit** is necessary to overcome original sin.
    - The Standards deny any ability in fallen man to contribute to his own salvation.
    - This underscores the monergistic nature of salvation.
    - "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good..." (WCF 9.3)

5. **Imputation in Justification**
    - Justification involves the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness to believers.
    - This mirrors the imputation of Adam’s guilt, but in reverse.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which Christ’s righteousness is received.
    - The doctrine excludes any infusion of righteousness or human merit.
    - "Those whom God effectually calleth, he also freely justifieth...by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them..." (WCF 11.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of **original sin** and **imputation**, influencing confessional Presbyterianism and many other Protestant traditions. Their articulation of federal headship and the parallel between Adam and Christ remains central to debates on sin, grace, and justification. The Standards’ careful distinctions continue to inform theological education and ecclesiastical practice, ensuring the enduring relevance of their doctrine in the life of the church.
