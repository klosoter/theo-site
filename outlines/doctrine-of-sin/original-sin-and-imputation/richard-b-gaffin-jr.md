# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches **original sin** and **imputation** through the lens of **union with Christ**, emphasizing the inseparability of the believer’s solidarity with Adam and with Christ. He affirms the **federal headship** of Adam and Christ, while also highlighting the existential and eschatological dimensions of **justification** and **sin’s transmission**. Gaffin’s work integrates classic Reformed categories with a redemptive-historical focus, situating **imputation** within the broader context of salvation applied.

- "The imputation of Adam’s sin and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness are correlative and must be understood in terms of union with their respective heads." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in Christ
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (in The Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Justification and Union with Christ" (in Justified in Christ, ed. K. Scott Oliphint)
- Perspectives on Pentecost

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Federal Headship and Solidarity**
    - Adam and Christ function as representative heads for humanity and the redeemed, respectively.
    - The guilt and corruption of **original sin** are transmitted through Adam’s federal role.
    - Christ’s obedience and righteousness are imputed to believers through His representative headship.
    - This framework preserves the objective grounding of both condemnation and justification.
    - "The forensic and the participatory are not alternatives but belong together in Paul’s soteriology." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Imputation within Union with Christ**
    - Imputation is inseparable from the believer’s union with Christ.
    - Justification is not a mere legal fiction but is grounded in real participation in Christ.
    - Both the negative (removal of guilt) and positive (reckoning of righteousness) aspects are included.
    - Union with Christ is the context for all soteriological benefits, including imputation.
    - "Justification is not simply a matter of imputation but of participation in Christ’s righteousness." (Justification and Union with Christ)

3. **Original Sin as Forensic and Existential**
    - Original sin involves both legal guilt and existential corruption.
    - The transmission of Adam’s sin is both judicial (imputed guilt) and ontological (inherited depravity).
    - The Reformed doctrine maintains the necessity of both aspects for a full account of human fallenness.
    - Gaffin resists reductionist readings that collapse one aspect into the other.
    - "Original sin is not merely a matter of imputed guilt but also of a corrupted nature." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Resurrection and Eschatological Vindication**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the ultimate vindication of His righteousness and the ground of the believer’s justification.
    - The benefits of Christ’s work, including imputation, are realized in union with the resurrected Lord.
    - The eschatological dimension shapes the application of salvation, including the reversal of Adamic condemnation.
    - Justification is thus both a present reality and an anticipation of final acquittal.
    - "The resurrection is the justification of Jesus and, in him, of all who are united to him." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Continuity with Reformed Confessionalism**
    - Gaffin upholds the classic formulations of the Westminster Standards on original sin and imputation.
    - He insists on the necessity of both the **active** and **passive obedience** of Christ for imputation.
    - His work seeks to integrate biblical-theological insights with confessional orthodoxy.
    - He critiques any move that would sever justification from its confessional and federal roots.
    - "The Westminster Standards rightly maintain the imputation of both Christ’s active and passive obedience." ("Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s contributions have reinforced the centrality of **union with Christ** in Reformed soteriology, especially regarding **original sin** and **imputation**. His integration of biblical theology with confessional tradition has shaped contemporary discussions on justification, federal headship, and the application of redemption. Gaffin’s influence is evident in the ongoing debates about the relationship between forensic and participatory categories in salvation, ensuring that classic Reformed doctrines remain robustly biblical and pastorally relevant.
