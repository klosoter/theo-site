### ESSAY
Original sin and imputation name a double reality and a legal mechanism at the heart of Christian anthropology and soteriology. Original sin is the native state of the human race after the first transgression, consisting of original guilt and original corruption. The guilt is forensic liability to condemnation before God, arising not primarily from each person’s actual sins but from the judicial reckoning of Adam’s primal disobedience as truly ours under **covenantal representation**. The corruption is the privation and disorder that pervade the human nature, rendering us inclined to evil and unable to fulfill the law of God. Imputation is the strictly forensic act whereby God, as judge, reckons to a person the moral status of another on the basis of a real bond of representation. The gospel pattern stands or falls with this: as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all the elect be made alive. A denial of the imputation of Adam’s sin almost invariably destabilizes the coherence and power of the imputation of Christ’s righteousness in justification. The question that drives the doctrine is whether God’s justice can be vindicated in reckoning Adam’s sin to us and Christ’s righteousness to us without falling into the charge of legal fiction.

Augustine of Hippo and Pelagius set the decisive contours of the doctrine. Augustine’s anti-Pelagian corpus established the grammar of the Western tradition and still controls the exegesis of Scripture and the theological architecture of the doctrine. In controversy with Pelagius, Augustine argued that the mass of humanity is born under condemnation, not through imitation only but through participation in Adam’s sin. The key marks of his method were biblical exegesis sharpened by metaphysical reflection on the unity of human nature, the distinction between guilt and corruption, and the moral inability that flows from a vitiated will. In his readings of Romans 5 and Psalm 51 he insisted that infants, dying before conscious acts, nevertheless need Christ’s salvation, which implies culpability and not mere misfortune. For Augustine, Adam was not only the first man but the root of human nature and the public person of humanity. In Adam the race willed its apostasy. He combined strands of realism and representation, speaking of us as both seminally present in Adam and legally bound to him in a divine order. He pressed the universality of death as a juridical sign: death reigns even over those who have not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, therefore the condemnation that death signifies must be due to Adam’s sin reckoned to them. Augustine’s contribution is conceptual and polemical. Conceptually he aligned guilt and corruption without collapsing them, treating concupiscence as sin under the law of God. Polemically he forced the church to clarify grace’s necessity and priority, for if we are born innocent, grace reduces to moral help. The conciliar Augustinianism of Carthage and Orange sealed these commitments by anathematizing Pelagian denials of original guilt and asserting the priority of **efficacious grace**.

Pelagius, on the other hand, redefined the human condition and thus the gospel. He taught that God commands only what we can do, that the will’s power is sufficient to obey, and that Adam’s sin injured only Adam, leaving his posterity neither guilty nor corrupted. Grace for Pelagius was mainly law, example, and forgiveness upon repentance. The Pelagian moral psychology sought to secure accountability but did so by emptying the problem of the fall. Pelagius prompted the critical questions that examiners still press. If guilt requires personal control, how can imputation be just. If corruption destroys liberty, how can responsibility survive. Augustine’s response remains the deep structure of the best answers. Responsibility is indexed not to autonomous self-origination of each moral state but to the integrity of a nature created upright and to a representative order God appointed for the race. The Pelagian alternative collapses under the weight of Scripture’s testimony to an inherited bondage and to the necessity of regenerating grace. It also collapses empirically, since the universality and early onset of vice across cultures and eras resist accounts that reduce sin to bad socialization.

John Calvin carried the Augustinian framework to maturity by integrating it into a whole-canon covenantal reading. In the Institutes and commentaries, especially on Romans, Calvin defines original sin as a hereditary depravity and the guilt of Adam’s first sin. He is precise that corruption is not mere bodily weakness but ardent concupiscence and a rancor against God, and he presses totality without absolutizing it into the loss of human nature. What is vital in Calvin is how he threads anthropology into **federal theology**. Without the later scholastic distinctions, he still insists that Adam stands as the representative of the human race under a divine order to obtain life by obedience. Adam’s transgression thus renders the race cursed. Calvin’s exegesis of Romans 5 binds the logic tight: the many were constituted sinners through the one man’s disobedience, and that constitution is juridical and ontological together. He makes the parallel with Christ explicit. To deny the former is to weaken the latter. His pastoral applications clarify why the doctrine is not abstract metaphysics but the frame of gospel comfort. Only when my guilt before God is legal and objective, prior to and deeper than my subjective failures, does a legal and objective righteousness in Christ avail to save. Only then does **justification by imputation** stand with full weight.

Francis Turretin gave the classic Reformed scholastic articulation, refining the contested points with exactitude and bringing **federal headship** to decisive clarity. In the Institutes of Elenctic Theology, Turretin argues for the immediate imputation of Adam’s first sin to all his posterity. Immediate means that the guilt of Adam’s act is reckoned directly to us by virtue of the **covenantal representation**, not after and because of our inherited corruption. Mediate imputation, which makes our condemnation result from the corruption we inherit and then imputes Adam’s sin to account for that corruption, inverts the order and erodes the symmetry with Christ. Turretin’s reason is twofold. First, exegesis. Romans 5 presents condemnation through the one transgression and justification through the one act of obedience. The decisive acts, not the derived moral states, ground the verdicts. Second, justice. If God condemns us for being corrupt apart from a prior guilt that grounds that corruption, then condemnation attaches to a condition rather than an act, and the legal structure of the gospel decays. Turretin is not a nominalist. He insists that the representative relation is real. Adam was a **public person** in a **covenant of works**, a divinely appointed legal order corresponding to the natural order in which we descend from him. He is careful to distinguish between the modes of union. Natural union to Adam is the conduit of corruption, but federal union is the juridical ground of imputation. The two unions coinhere without collapsing into a crude realism. With the same rigor, Turretin defends the concept of imputation against the charge of legal fiction. Imputation never transfers moral qualities from one subject to another. It declares that what a representative did counts for those he represents, because God truly appointed him as their head. That is why the doctrine must be upheld in parallel for Christ’s righteousness. Turretin anticipates key objections. Does Ezekiel 18 forbid the imputation of the father’s guilt to the son. No, the prophet prohibits human judges from punishing children for their immediate father’s crimes, while God himself teaches federal solidarity in Adam and in Christ. Does immediate imputation condemn infants unjustly. No, infants are truly under Adam’s headship and share his guilt, which is why they need Christ; but the gospel does not compel a conclusion about the numerical scope of infant salvation. Does imputation destroy freedom. No, it names a legal relation that grounds our corrupt condition, and from within that condition our moral inability is voluntary and culpable. Our yes to sin is that of a fallen will, not of an externally coerced agent.

Jonathan Edwards reinterpreted and strengthened Augustinian-Reformed lines by providing a metaphysical and moral psychology that renders imputation intelligible. In Original Sin and Freedom of the Will, Edwards frames human identity as constituted under the divine moral government. He resists crude biological realism. We are not numerically the same subject as Adam. Rather, God constituted the race as one in Adam for the ends of moral government. This is not arbitrary. It reflects a fit order where the first father acts as the public person of the race. Edwards then shows, with empirical acuity, that moral depravity is universal and invincible apart from grace. He keys moral inability to the absence of a righteous disposition and shows that inability does not remove responsibility when the heart’s inclinations are the agent’s own. Edwards thereby responds to the Pelagian control objection. We are responsible for what flows from our hearts, even if we cannot do otherwise, when the inability is of the moral kind and arises from the will’s own bent. In defending imputation, he aligns with immediate imputation, because the forensic verdict does not wait upon the empirical emergence of corruption, nor does it rest on personal acts. He emphasizes the parallel with Christ. God constitutes believers righteous by reckoning to them the obedience of Christ, his active and passive righteous accomplishment, under a federal unity that is just as real as Adamic unity and infinitely more blessed. Edwards is not without difficulties. His accounts of identity and of God’s decrees can sound like occasionalism to an incautious reader. But the heart of his contribution stands: imputation is a public constitution of moral status, fitting to a divine, personal order, and deeply consonant with the way God governs the world through representatives and covenants.

The internal debates within the Augustinian-Reformed tradition turn on three axes. First, the mode of imputation. The mediate-imputation position, often linked to the name of Placeus and, in modified forms, to later Reformed voices, makes inherited corruption the basis of our condemnation, and uses Adam’s sin to explain that corruption. This position intends to secure justice by tying guilt to a present condition one actually has. Yet it undermines the Romans 5 parallel and risks making corruption the ground of guilt in a way that shadows justification, where we are counted righteous before any inherent righteousness. The immediate-imputation position defended here better preserves the forensic-then-renewal order and guards the Christological analogy. Second, the ground of our bond to Adam. Realism asserts that we were physically or seminally present in Adam and thus truly acted in him. Federalism insists that the moral identity arises from divine appointment of Adam as representative. Pure realism struggles to account for the forensic structure of Romans 5 and can dissolve the distinctively covenantal nature of Adam’s headship. Pure federalism sometimes forgets the natural bond that explains how corruption is propagated. A refined federal-real conjunction does best: Adam is the natural root and the federal head, so guilt is imputed for the first sin immediately and corruption is propagated through natural generation under the curse. Third, the origin of souls. Traducianism can empirically harmonize with the propagation of corruption, but creationism preserves the immediacy of God’s creating act for each soul. Either can be held if one makes clear that the transmission of corruption is not a positive infusion of evil by God but the privation and disorder of a nature now deprived of original righteousness under the covenantal curse.

External disputes come from several fronts. The Roman Catholic tradition, especially codified at Trent, affirms original sin and even its guilt, yet it configures concupiscence after baptism as an inclination that is not properly sin without consent. This works with a different anthropology and sacramentology that tends to weaken the depth of corruption and to lean toward inherent righteousness in justification. The Eastern Orthodox account of ancestral sin emphasizes mortality and corruption but typically rejects inherited guilt. While it preserves the tragic solidarity of the race, it cannot make robust sense of the forensic depth of Romans 5 and it risks severing the Adam Christ parallel at the crucial point of verdict and remedy. Arminian theology often reframes original sin through universal prevenient grace that restores ability. This softens moral inability and shifts the weight of responsibility, often diluting the force of imputation. Karl Barth rejects the two-Adams federalism and replaces it with a Christological determination of election and humanity. Adam becomes the man of disobedience whose identity is already set within a divine Yes in Christ. Imputation is transfigured into participation. The cost is the loss of a real forensic condemnation in Adam and the collapsing of justification into an ontological status that all humanity shares, calling into question the gospel’s legal act and the need for personal faith. The Pelagian and semi-Pelagian lines remain the abiding external threat, whether in classical moralism or contemporary therapeutic religion.

Several contemporary stress tests refine and confirm the doctrine. Evolutionary accounts of human origins press the historical Adam. If there was no first man whose disobedience initiated the fall, the federal structure collapses. Several models are on the table. One can affirm a historical Adam situated within a broader population and maintain legal headship and natural descent through genealogical pathways that rapidly include all. The exegetical demands of Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 require a real Adam whose one act stands as the judicial hinge of the race, and the doctrinal web of **covenant of works**, **penal substitution**, and **justification by imputation** requires it. Analytic debates about moral responsibility challenge imputation on control grounds. The response is to distinguish kinds of control and to insist on the justice of **public person** representation. In human law, corporate agents act and their acts bind the whole. Scripture buttresses this. Levi is said to tithe in Abraham. The sin of Achan implicates Israel. The covenantal structure of humanity is not a legal fiction but the deep order of creation. Contemporary accounts of structural sin confirm original sin’s plausibility. We are born into networks of vice and injustice that shape our dispositions and choices long before any mature consent. This social embeddedness is not yet guilt, but it helps modern ears understand how corruption can be native and how representation operates. The doctrine then clarifies what social theories cannot: that this condition is the fruit of a primal legal catastrophe and is removed by a legal act in the second Adam, whose obedience is reckoned to us in union with him and whose Spirit renovates our nature.

The decisive exegetical center is Romans 5. Paul teaches that sin entered through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all because all sinned. The all sinned cannot mean merely that all personally sinned, since Paul’s argument would collapse into a truism and his next lines claim that death reigned over those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam. The syntax implies that all sinned in the sin of the one man as their head. Further, by the trespass of the one the many died, and by one act of righteousness the many receive justification. The forensic pair condemnation and justification shows that the parallel is legal, not first transformative. The many were constituted sinners through the disobedience of the one. This is not imitation, which cannot explain the death of those who cannot imitate. Nor is it merely realism, which cannot easily explain why the one act stands with juridical centrality. It is **covenantal representation**. The Adam Christ parallel is the fulcrum. Any reading that dilutes condemnation in Adam will tend to dilute justification in Christ. The doctrine therefore secures both the necessity of union with Christ and the strict extrinsic righteousness of justification, without which sanctification loses its evangelical engine.

Examiners will press fairness. Is it just to condemn me for a sin I did not commit. The answer begins with God. Justice is not an abstract standard external to God but the rectitude of his will. Under **analogical knowledge**, we confess that human analogies are true but not exhaustive. Within that frame, the covenantal order reveals that God has appointed representation as the moral architecture of humanity. That order is not arbitrary. Adam’s headship matches his natural primacy. The good of the race would have been secured by a single obedience. The stakes were high because the reward was high. Representation is also our daily moral fabric. Families, churches, and polities operate by representative acts that bind the many. We object most loudly to imputation in Adam while we rely entirely on imputation in Christ. Yet the two stand or fall together. The gospel’s answer to the fairness worry is not to deny representation but to overwhelm Adamic imputation with the richer and superabundant grace of Christ’s imputation. Where sin abounded, grace hyperabounded. The fairness question also receives a psychological answer. Our actual sins ratify the original verdict. We do not suffer as righteous persons wrongly condemned. We eagerly consent to Adam’s rebellion in our own acts. The verdict of original guilt is confirmed by our daily transgressions.

Another likely objection charges God with authorship of sin if he decreed a fallen order in which representation secures inevitable corruption. The response relies on **secondary causation** and the privative nature of evil. God decrees and governs all things without sin. Adam’s sin was a true act of a free agent, not coerced, within a providential order ordered to display both justice and mercy. Corruption is the privation of original righteousness, not a positive substance infused by God. God’s imputation of guilt does not make us sinful; it recognizes, under the covenant, the true legal status of humanity in its head, which then licenses the withdrawal of supernatural gifts and the consequent disorder. The decree does not collapse into causation, and divine permission is real without indifference. The payoff for soteriology is decisive. Only when imputation is preserved can **penal substitution** be coherent. Christ bears the guilt imputed to him as our head, though personally sinless, and satisfies justice for us. If imputation were unjust, the cross would be either immoral or unintelligible.

The doctrine also integrates with ecclesiology and sacramentology. The church is the community of those transferred from Adam to Christ. Baptism is the covenantal sign of union with the second Adam, not a magical removal of concupiscence. The Lord’s Supper nourishes those who live by an alien righteousness. Pastoral practice follows. We do not flatter sinners with the language of mere brokenness. We tell the truth about a legal plight and a moral bondage. We also hold forth the only medicine that can meet such a condition, the imputative and regenerative grace of Christ. This frames preaching, catechesis, and the cure of souls.

I defend the classic Reformed position. Adam stood under a **covenant of works** as the federal head of the human race. Upon his first sin, God immediately imputed that guilt to all his posterity, and under that sentence withheld original righteousness, so that we inherit corruption and are by nature children of wrath. This immediate imputation secures the legal architecture within which the second Adam saves. In union with Christ, the federal head of the new humanity, God immediately imputes his righteousness to believers, apart from works, and then renovates them by the Spirit. Augustine gives the structure and exegesis. Calvin integrates it into the whole counsel of God with covenantal breadth. Turretin secures the forensic order with scholastic precision. Edwards supplies a metaphysical and moral psychological account that renders it persuasive in modern terms. Pelagius finally illustrates the perennial alternative and its bankruptcy.

Two final clarifications bring the doctrine into the present. First, Ezekiel 18 and Deuteronomy 24 do not gainsay imputation. They regulate human courts and limit the civil reach of justice to personal acts, while the divine court operates by a prior and deeper covenantal order. Second, evolutionary accounts need not destroy the doctrine. Whatever the biological pathways, the doctrine requires a historical Adam who stands as federal head and natural root. Genealogical accounts show how quickly one pair can become universal ancestors. Scripture sets the theological requirements. Science can map the providential pathways but cannot overturn the covenantal reality. The doctrine remains morally bracing and evangelically sweet. It humbles us under a guilt we cannot deny and frees us by a righteousness we cannot achieve. It tells the truth about the world we actually inhabit, a world in which every infant is born into a web of good and evil not of his making, and in which God has appointed a gracious head who can lift us into life. The imputation of Adam’s sin is severe justice. The imputation of Christ’s righteousness is astonishing mercy. Together they render the cross coherent, the church hopeful, and the Christian life anchored in the unshakeable verdict of God.

### RECAP NOTES

- Decisive figures: Augustine defended inherited guilt and corruption against Pelagius; Pelagius denied original guilt and reduced grace to law and example; Calvin integrated Augustinianism into **federal theology** and tied imputation to justification; Turretin articulated immediate imputation under a **covenant of works** with scholastic precision; Edwards defended imputation via moral government and constitution, linking moral inability to responsibility.
- Debates:
  - Internal: immediate vs mediate imputation, federal headship vs realism, traducianism vs creationism, whether concupiscence is sin.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian denials, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox alternatives, Arminian prevenience adjustments, Barth’s anti-federal reframing.
  - Contemporary: historical Adam and evolution, analytic responsibility and fairness, structural sin, empirical universality of vice.
- Defended position: classic Reformed account of immediate imputation of Adam’s first sin grounded in **federal headship**, with inherited corruption following, securing the symmetry with Christ’s imputed righteousness.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Is imputation just if I did not personally act. Answer: Yes, under God’s just order of **public person** representation, confirmed by Scripture and required by the Christ parallel.
  - Does Ezekiel 18 forbid imputing the father’s guilt. Answer: It limits human courts; it does not overturn divine **covenantal representation** in Adam and Christ.
  - Why immediate rather than mediate imputation. Answer: Romans 5 grounds condemnation in the one act, preserving the forensic-then-renewal order and the Christological symmetry.
  - Does this make God author of sin. Answer: No, evil is privation and arises through **secondary causation**; imputation is judicial reckoning, not infusion of evil.
  - How does evolution affect the doctrine. Answer: The doctrine requires a historical Adam as federal head; genealogical models preserve this without capitulating on **original sin**.
