# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated a robust doctrine of **original sin** and **imputation** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the federal headship of Adam and the necessity of Christ’s **vicarious atonement**. He upheld the historicity of the Fall and the transmission of **guilt** and **corruption** to all humanity, grounding his views in a high view of **Scripture’s authority** and the **covenantal structure** of redemptive history.

- "The race fell in Adam, and in Adam’s fall we sinned all." (The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 9: Studies in Theology)

## Key Works

- "The Doctrine of the Trinity and the Person of Christ" (in Studies in Theology)
- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Biblical Doctrine of Redemption"
- "The Human Development of Jesus" (in The Person and Work of Christ)
- "The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield" (esp. Vol. 9: Studies in Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the **representative** of the human race in the covenant of works.
    - The guilt of Adam’s first sin is **imputed** to all his descendants.
    - This headship is foundational for understanding both **original sin** and **justification**.
    - Warfield defends this view as both **biblically warranted** and necessary for the coherence of the gospel.
    - "Adam was constituted the representative of his race, and his act was, therefore, the act of us all." (Studies in Theology)

2. **Transmission of Guilt and Corruption**
    - Original sin involves both **forensic guilt** and an inherited **corrupt nature**.
    - The transmission is not merely by imitation but by **imputation** and **generation**.
    - Warfield distinguishes between the **legal** and **moral** aspects of original sin.
    - He rejects Pelagian and semi-Pelagian accounts as unbiblical and inadequate.
    - "We are not sinners because we sin, but we sin because we are sinners." (Studies in Theology)

3. **Necessity of Imputation for Salvation**
    - The imputation of Adam’s sin is paralleled by the imputation of **Christ’s righteousness**.
    - Justification depends on the **alien righteousness** of Christ being credited to believers.
    - Warfield sees imputation as essential to the **Reformed doctrine of salvation**.
    - He insists that denying imputation undermines the gospel’s coherence and efficacy.
    - "The parallelism between Adam and Christ is the very hinge of Paul’s doctrine of salvation." (Studies in Theology)

4. **Scriptural Authority and Exegesis**
    - Warfield grounds his doctrine of original sin and imputation in **careful exegesis** of Scripture, especially Romans 5.
    - He upholds the **inerrancy** and **sufficiency** of the biblical witness.
    - Warfield critiques alternative views for lacking scriptural support.
    - He sees the biblical narrative as covenantally structured, with Adam and Christ as the two great heads.
    - "The doctrine of original sin is not a speculative doctrine, but a biblical one." (Studies in Theology)

5. **Opposition to Modernist and Pelagian Tendencies**
    - Warfield critiques modern theology for minimizing or denying **original sin** and **imputation**.
    - He defends the traditional Reformed view against both liberal and Roman Catholic reinterpretations.
    - Warfield warns that abandoning these doctrines leads to a diminished view of **grace** and the necessity of **redemption**.
    - He sees the denial of original sin as a threat to the integrity of the Christian faith.
    - "To deny original sin is to undermine the very foundations of the gospel." (Studies in Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **original sin** and **imputation** remains a touchstone in Reformed theology, shaping subsequent evangelical and confessional discussions. His rigorous defense of federal headship and the necessity of imputation has influenced systematic theology, biblical studies, and debates on the doctrine of sin. Warfield’s work continues to be cited as a standard for understanding the relationship between Adam, Christ, and the salvation of sinners. His legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of the **covenantal structure** of redemptive history and the centrality of imputation in the doctrine of justification.
