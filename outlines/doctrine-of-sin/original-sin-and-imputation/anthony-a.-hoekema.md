# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema, a Reformed theologian, articulated a robust doctrine of **original sin** grounded in the historic **federal headship** of Adam and the **imputation** of Adam’s guilt to all humanity. He emphasized the pervasive corruption of human nature and the necessity of **union with Christ** for the reversal of sin’s effects, maintaining a clear distinction between **guilt** and **pollution** in the transmission of original sin.

- "We are not sinners because we sin, but we sin because we are sinners." ("Created in God's Image")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Inherited Guilt and Corruption**
   - Humanity inherits both the **guilt** and **corruption** of Adam’s first sin.
   - The transmission of original sin is not merely by imitation but by a real, ontological connection.
   - All people are born in a state of alienation from God due to Adam’s transgression.
   - The effects of original sin are total, impacting every aspect of human nature.
   - "Original sin, therefore, includes both guilt and pollution." (Created in God's Image)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
   - Adam acted as the representative or **federal head** for all humanity.
   - Adam’s disobedience is judicially imputed to his descendants.
   - This federal relationship explains the universality of sin and death.
   - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to understanding imputation.
   - "Adam was the representative head of the human race, so that his act was regarded as the act of all." (Created in God's Image)

3. **Imputation of Adam’s Sin**
   - The guilt of Adam’s first sin is **imputed** to all his posterity.
   - Imputation is a legal or forensic act, not a transfer of moral character.
   - This imputation is the basis for the condemnation of all humanity.
   - The doctrine safeguards the necessity of **justification by faith** in Christ.
   - "The guilt of Adam’s sin is imputed to us, just as the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers." (Created in God's Image)

4. **Distinction Between Guilt and Pollution**
   - **Guilt** refers to liability to punishment; **pollution** refers to the corruption of nature.
   - Both aspects are present in original sin but must be distinguished for clarity.
   - The work of Christ addresses both guilt (by justification) and pollution (by sanctification).
   - This distinction helps explain the ongoing struggle with sin in the believer’s life.
   - "Original sin consists of both the guilt of Adam’s first sin and the pollution of our nature." (Created in God's Image)

5. **Union with Christ as Remedy**
   - Only through **union with Christ** can the effects of original sin be overcome.
   - Christ’s obedience and righteousness are imputed to believers.
   - Regeneration initiates the process of reversing the corruption of sin.
   - The believer’s new identity is grounded in Christ’s redemptive work, not Adam’s fall.
   - "It is only in Christ that we are delivered from both the guilt and the pollution of sin." (Created in God's Image)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of **original sin** and **imputation** remains influential in contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of **anthropology** and **soteriology**. His careful distinctions and biblical grounding have shaped evangelical understandings of human depravity and the necessity of Christ’s redemptive work. Hoekema’s writings continue to serve as standard resources for students and pastors seeking clarity on the doctrine of sin and salvation.
