# N.T. Wright (1948– )

N.T. Wright approaches **original sin** and **imputation** through the lens of **Second Temple Judaism** and the **covenant faithfulness** of God, challenging traditional Reformed readings. He emphasizes the **corporate dimension of sin** and interprets **justification** as God’s declaration of membership in the covenant community, rather than the transfer of Christ’s righteousness to the believer. Wright’s perspective reframes **imputation** as being “in Christ” rather than a legal transaction.

- "The righteousness of God is not an object, a substance or a gas which can be passed across the courtroom." (What Saint Paul Really Said)

## Key Works

- What Saint Paul Really Said (1997)
- Paul and the Faithfulness of God (2013)
- Justification: God’s Plan and Paul’s Vision (2009)
- The Resurrection of the Son of God (2003)
- The Climax of the Covenant (1991)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Corporate and Covenantal**
    - Views **original sin** in terms of humanity’s solidarity in Adam and Israel’s representative role.
    - Emphasizes the narrative of exile and restoration as the context for understanding sin.
    - Argues that sin is both a personal and a communal reality.
    - Sees Adam’s sin as inaugurating a reign of death affecting all humanity.
    - "The problem is not simply that every individual has sinned, but that the whole human race is in Adam." (Paul and the Faithfulness of God)

2. **Justification as Covenant Membership**
    - Defines **justification** as God’s declaration that someone is a member of the covenant family.
    - Rejects the idea that justification is about the transfer of moral righteousness.
    - Stresses the forensic and eschatological dimensions of justification.
    - Connects justification to the resurrection and the new creation.
    - "Justification is not how someone becomes a Christian. It is the declaration that they are a Christian." (What Saint Paul Really Said)

3. **Imputation as Incorporation in Christ**
    - Argues that **imputation** is best understood as being united to Christ, not as a legal crediting of righteousness.
    - Emphasizes participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - Rejects the notion of a “transfer” of Christ’s obedience to the believer’s account.
    - Focuses on the believer’s new identity within the Messiah.
    - "Paul never says that God reckons to believers a righteousness that does not belong to them." (Justification: God’s Plan and Paul’s Vision)

4. **Critique of Traditional Reformed Categories**
    - Challenges the Reformed distinction between **imputed righteousness** and **infused righteousness**.
    - Argues that Reformation debates misunderstood Paul’s context.
    - Suggests that “righteousness of God” refers to God’s own faithfulness, not a status given to believers.
    - Sees Reformed categories as shaped by later theological controversies, not by Paul’s intent.
    - "The righteousness of God is God’s own righteousness, not something that he can bestow on us." (What Saint Paul Really Said)

5. **Sin and Redemption in the Story of Israel**
    - Frames **original sin** and redemption within the narrative of Israel’s failure and Christ’s fulfillment.
    - Sees Jesus as the true Israelite who succeeds where Adam and Israel failed.
    - Connects the solution to sin with the fulfillment of God’s promises to Abraham.
    - Emphasizes the continuity between Israel’s story and the church’s identity in Christ.
    - "Jesus is the one in whom the story of Israel, and thus the story of Adam, comes to its climax." (Paul and the Faithfulness of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Wright’s reframing of **original sin** and **imputation** has significantly influenced contemporary Pauline studies, sparking debate within both academic and ecclesial contexts. His emphasis on **covenant membership** and the narrative of Israel has challenged traditional Reformed categories and prompted renewed discussion about the meaning of justification. While some see his views as a corrective to individualistic readings, others critique his departure from confessional orthodoxy. Wright’s work continues to shape conversations about the relationship between biblical theology and systematic theology.
