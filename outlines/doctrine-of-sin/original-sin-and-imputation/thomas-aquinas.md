# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a nuanced doctrine of **original sin** rooted in his broader understanding of **human nature**, **concupiscence**, and **grace**. He argued that original sin is transmitted through **generation** and consists primarily in the privation of original righteousness, rather than a positive stain, and that **imputation** is not forensic but ontological, affecting the very nature of the soul.

- "Original sin is called sin not in the sense that it is an act, but in the sense that it is a state born of the origin of our nature." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 81, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, I-II, Questions 81–89
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 52–55
- Commentary on Romans (Super Epistolam ad Romanos Lectura)
- De Malo, Questions 4–6
- Aquinas on Human Nature (secondary: Pasnau, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Privation of Original Justice**
   - Original sin is fundamentally the loss of **original righteousness**.
   - It is not a positive corruption but a privation that disorders the will.
   - This privation leads to **concupiscence**, inclining humans toward sin.
   - The state is inherited by all through natural generation from Adam.
   - "Original sin is nothing else than the privation of original justice." (ST I-II, Q. 82, a. 3)

2. **Transmission by Generation, Not Imitation**
   - Original sin is passed on through the act of human procreation.
   - The soul receives its fallen state as it is united to the body.
   - This transmission is not by imitation of Adam’s act, but by descent.
   - All humans, except Christ, inherit this state from Adam as the head of the race.
   - "Original sin is transmitted by way of origin, not by way of imitation." (ST I-II, Q. 81, a. 1)

3. **Imputation as Ontological, Not Merely Forensic**
   - Aquinas rejects a purely legal or external imputation of Adam’s guilt.
   - The effect of Adam’s sin is a real change in human nature, not just a change in status.
   - The guilt of original sin is the lack of original justice, not a personal act.
   - Restoration requires **grace** to heal the nature and restore righteousness.
   - "The guilt of original sin is contracted through origin, not through imitation." (ST I-II, Q. 81, a. 2)

4. **Concupiscence as Effect, Not Essence, of Original Sin**
   - Concupiscence is the disordered desire resulting from the loss of original justice.
   - It is not itself the substance of original sin, but its consequence.
   - Baptism removes the guilt of original sin but concupiscence remains as a tendency.
   - The struggle with concupiscence is part of the human condition post-Fall.
   - "Concupiscence remains after baptism, not as sin, but as an inclination to sin." (ST I-II, Q. 82, a. 3, ad 2)

5. **Necessity of Grace for Restoration**
   - Human nature, wounded by original sin, cannot restore itself.
   - Only **divine grace** can heal the soul and restore original righteousness.
   - The sacraments, especially baptism, are the means by which grace is applied.
   - Justification involves both the removal of guilt and the infusion of new righteousness.
   - "By baptism, man is delivered from original sin and brought back to the state of grace." (ST III, Q. 69, a. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **original sin** shaped later Catholic theology by emphasizing the ontological, rather than purely forensic, nature of humanity’s fallen state. His distinction between the loss of original justice and the presence of concupiscence influenced both medieval and post-Reformation debates. Aquinas’s synthesis of **nature and grace** continues to inform contemporary discussions on sin, anthropology, and salvation, marking him as a foundational figure in Western theological tradition.
