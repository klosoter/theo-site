# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge was a leading figure in the **Princeton Theology** and a staunch defender of **Reformed orthodoxy** regarding **original sin** and **imputation**. He maintained that Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity, so Adam’s first sin is both the ground for the corruption of human nature and the judicial basis for the **imputation of guilt** to all his descendants. Hodge argued that this imputation is not merely a transmission of moral influence but a real reckoning of Adam’s guilt to the entire human race.

- "The sin of Adam, therefore, is the judicial ground of the condemnation of his race." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially Vol. 2, chapters on Original Sin and Imputation)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on original sin and federal theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam represented all humanity in the **covenant of works**.
    - Adam’s first sin is legally and covenantally attributed to his descendants.
    - The relationship is not merely natural but judicial and representative.
    - This headship grounds both the imputation of guilt and the transmission of corruption.
    - "Adam was the representative of his race, and his act is judicially regarded as their act." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Imputation of Adam’s Guilt**
    - The guilt of Adam’s first sin is reckoned to all his posterity.
    - Imputation is a forensic act, not a physical or moral transmission.
    - All humans are born under condemnation due to this imputation.
    - This doctrine upholds the necessity of **justification by faith** in Christ, the second Adam.
    - "The imputation of Adam’s sin is not a fiction, but a real and judicial transaction." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Transmission of Corruption**
    - Alongside guilt, a corrupt nature is propagated to all humans.
    - This corruption is total, affecting every aspect of human nature.
    - The propagation is through ordinary generation, not by creation.
    - The corruption is both the consequence and evidence of the imputed guilt.
    - "The corruption of nature is the penal consequence of Adam’s sin." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Distinction Between Mediate and Immediate Imputation**
    - Hodge defends **immediate imputation**: Adam’s guilt is imputed directly, not through inherited corruption.
    - He rejects the view that guilt is imputed only because of our own depravity.
    - Immediate imputation preserves the forensic character of original sin.
    - This view aligns with classic Reformed confessions.
    - "The sin of Adam is imputed to us, not because we are personally depraved, but we are depraved because his sin is imputed to us." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Parallel Between Adam and Christ**
    - The structure of imputation is mirrored in the work of Christ, the **second Adam**.
    - Just as Adam’s guilt is imputed to all, Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers.
    - This parallel is essential for understanding **justification** and the gospel.
    - The analogy safeguards the coherence of Reformed soteriology.
    - "As the sin of Adam is imputed to us, so the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust articulation of **original sin** and **imputation** became foundational for later American Reformed theology, especially within the **Princeton tradition**. His defense of federal headship and forensic imputation shaped generations of theologians and remains a standard reference in debates over human depravity and justification. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of **covenant theology** and the doctrine of sin, ensuring his continued relevance in systematic theology.
