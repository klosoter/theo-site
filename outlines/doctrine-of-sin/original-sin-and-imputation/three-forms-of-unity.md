# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust doctrine of **original sin** and its **imputation** to all humanity, emphasizing the inherited guilt and corruption stemming from Adam’s first transgression. These confessions underscore that all people are conceived and born in **sin**, unable to do any true good apart from **regeneration** in Christ, and that Adam’s guilt is legally imputed to his descendants. The remedy for this condition is found in the **imputed righteousness of Christ**, received by faith alone.

- "We believe that by the disobedience of Adam original sin has been spread through the whole human race." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Articles 14–16
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Days 2–4, Q&A 6–8
- Canons of Dort, Third and Fourth Main Points of Doctrine, Articles 1–4
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical and Reformed Creeds and Confessions)
- The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism (Lyle D. Bierma)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Universal Guilt through Adam’s Fall**
   - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity, so his sin is counted as the sin of all.
   - All people are born with the **guilt and corruption** of original sin.
   - The **imputation** of Adam’s guilt is judicial, not merely biological or moral.
   - This condition renders all people liable to **condemnation** apart from grace.
   - "Original sin is a corruption of the whole nature and an inherited depravity." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 7)

2. **Total Inability of Fallen Humanity**
   - Humanity is so corrupted by original sin that it is incapable of any **spiritual good**.
   - Free will is lost in spiritual matters; only **regeneration** can restore true ability.
   - Even infants are included in this corruption and guilt.
   - The **law** reveals this inability and drives sinners to Christ.
   - "We are so corrupt that we are totally unable to do any good and inclined to all evil." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 8)

3. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
   - Just as Adam’s guilt is imputed, so Christ’s righteousness is **imputed** to believers.
   - This imputation is received by **faith alone**, not by works.
   - The believer is declared **righteous** before God solely on the basis of Christ’s obedience.
   - This is the heart of the **gospel** and the ground of assurance.
   - "God imputes to us the righteousness of Christ." (Belgic Confession, Art. 22)

4. **Necessity of Regeneration**
   - Regeneration is required to overcome the effects of original sin.
   - The **Holy Spirit** works faith and new life in the elect.
   - Regeneration is a sovereign act of God, not a human achievement.
   - Without regeneration, no one can see or enter the **kingdom of God**.
   - "Regeneration is a supernatural work, accomplished by the Spirit." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Art. 12)

5. **Covenantal Structure of Imputation**
   - The relationship between Adam and his descendants is covenantal.
   - The **Covenant of Works** frames Adam’s role as representative.
   - The **Covenant of Grace** provides the remedy in Christ, the second Adam.
   - Both guilt and righteousness are transmitted through **covenantal headship**.
   - "As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 20)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on original sin and imputation, providing a confessional standard for churches in the Dutch and continental Reformed tradition. Their clear articulation of **federal headship**, inherited guilt, and the necessity of Christ’s imputed righteousness continues to inform theological education, preaching, and pastoral care. These documents remain central to debates on **anthropology**, soteriology, and covenant theology within global Reformed communities.
