# Robert Letham (1947– )

Robert Letham affirms the **Reformed doctrine of original sin** and the **imputation of Adam’s guilt and corruption** to all humanity, emphasizing both the solidarity of the human race in Adam and the necessity of Christ’s **federal headship** for salvation. He maintains that **original sin** is not merely imitation but a real transmission of both guilt and a corrupted nature, resolved only through the **imputed righteousness of Christ**. Letham’s approach is marked by careful engagement with **Scripture**, **Reformed confessions**, and historical theology.

- "The guilt and corruption of Adam’s sin are imputed to all his descendants, just as the righteousness of Christ is imputed to all who are in him." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Real and Forensic**
    - Original sin involves both a **forensic imputation of guilt** and the inheritance of a corrupted nature.
    - Humanity’s solidarity in Adam means all are born under condemnation and moral inability.
    - Letham upholds the Augustinian and Reformed understanding against Pelagian and semi-Pelagian views.
    - He stresses that original sin is not simply bad example or environment, but a real condition.
    - "Original sin is both a state and a verdict, affecting all without exception." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam and Christ**
    - Adam acts as the **federal representative** for all humanity, so his sin is counted as theirs.
    - Christ, as the second Adam, represents his people, so his righteousness is imputed to them.
    - This federal structure is rooted in **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15**.
    - Letham sees this as essential for understanding both condemnation and justification.
    - "The parallel between Adam and Christ is foundational for Paul’s doctrine of imputation." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Imputation of Guilt and Righteousness**
    - The guilt of Adam’s first sin is imputed to all his descendants by virtue of covenantal union.
    - Likewise, Christ’s obedience is imputed to believers by union with him.
    - Imputation is not a legal fiction but a covenantal reality grounded in God’s justice.
    - Letham distinguishes between the imputation of guilt (legal) and the transmission of corruption (ontological).
    - "Imputation is the means by which both condemnation and justification are effected." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Transmission of Corruption**
    - All humans inherit a corrupted nature from Adam, resulting in total depravity.
    - This corruption is not merely external but affects the whole person—mind, will, and affections.
    - Letham affirms that this corruption is present from conception.
    - He maintains that only regeneration by the Holy Spirit can overcome this corruption.
    - "We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Role of Union with Christ**
    - Union with Christ is the context in which imputation and the reversal of original sin occur.
    - Through union, believers participate in Christ’s righteousness and life.
    - Letham emphasizes that union is both legal and transformative.
    - This union is the basis for both justification (imputed righteousness) and sanctification (renewed nature).
    - "Union with Christ is the fountainhead of all blessings, including the remedy for original sin." (Union with Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Letham’s work has reinforced the **Reformed understanding of original sin and imputation** for contemporary readers, providing clarity on the federal and covenantal dimensions of these doctrines. His careful engagement with both **Scripture** and the **Westminster Standards** has made his theology a significant resource for pastors, students, and scholars. By situating these doctrines within the broader framework of union with Christ, Letham has contributed to a renewed appreciation of the coherence and depth of classic Reformed soteriology.
