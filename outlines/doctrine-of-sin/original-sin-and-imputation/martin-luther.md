# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of **original sin** centers on the radical corruption of human nature inherited from Adam, which renders all people fundamentally sinful and incapable of self-redemption. He strongly affirms the **imputation** of Adam’s guilt to all humanity, as well as the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** to believers, grounding both in a forensic understanding of justification. For Luther, these doctrines underscore the utter necessity of **divine grace** and the futility of human works for salvation.

- "Through Adam’s fall sin has come down to us all, and by sin death and the wrath of God." (Lectures on Romans)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Romans (1515–1516)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Commentary on Galatians (1535)
- The Smalcald Articles (1537)
- Luther’s Small Catechism (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Total Depravity**
    - Humanity is wholly corrupted in will, intellect, and affections due to Adam’s transgression.
    - Original sin is not merely a lack of righteousness but an active inclination toward evil.
    - All human actions, even seemingly good ones, are tainted by sin apart from grace.
    - This corruption is inherited by all, making everyone subject to God’s wrath.
    - "Original sin is not a slight, but so deep a corruption of human nature that no reason can understand it." (Smalcald Articles)

2. **Imputation of Adam’s Guilt**
    - Adam’s sin is legally counted (imputed) to all his descendants.
    - The whole human race stands guilty before God because of Adam’s act.
    - This imputation is forensic, not a matter of personal moral failure.
    - The universality of death and condemnation demonstrates this imputed guilt.
    - "Through one man’s sin, all men became sinners and are subject to death and the devil." (Lectures on Romans)

3. **Forensic Justification by Christ’s Righteousness**
    - Justification is a legal declaration, not an infusion of righteousness.
    - Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers by faith alone.
    - The believer remains inherently sinful but is counted righteous before God.
    - This imputation is the only ground for acceptance with God.
    - "We are accounted righteous before God, not on account of our works, but on account of faith in Christ." (Commentary on Galatians)

4. **Necessity of Grace and the Bondage of the Will**
    - Human will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose God apart from grace.
    - Divine grace alone can free the will and enable faith.
    - The doctrine of original sin highlights the absolute necessity of grace.
    - Any attempt at self-justification is futile and prideful.
    - "The will is by nature so enslaved that it cannot turn itself to good." (The Bondage of the Will)

5. **Sin Remains in the Regenerate**
    - Even after regeneration, believers continue to struggle with indwelling sin.
    - Justification is always by imputation, not by inherent righteousness.
    - The Christian life is marked by continual repentance and reliance on Christ’s merit.
    - Sanctification is real but never perfect in this life.
    - "Simul iustus et peccator—at the same time righteous and a sinner." (Commentary on Galatians)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s articulation of **original sin** and **imputation** profoundly shaped Protestant theology, especially the Reformation’s emphasis on **justification by faith alone**. His forensic understanding of both Adam’s guilt and Christ’s righteousness set the trajectory for later Lutheran and Reformed confessions. Luther’s insights continue to inform debates on human nature, grace, and the means of salvation, making his doctrines foundational for subsequent evangelical and confessional traditions.
