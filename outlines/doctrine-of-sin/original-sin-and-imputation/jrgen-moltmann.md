# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets **original sin** and **imputation** through the lens of **eschatological hope** and **Trinitarian theology**, challenging traditional Augustinian and Reformed formulations. He emphasizes the communal, historical, and systemic dimensions of sin, focusing on **solidarity** and the transformative participation of humanity in Christ rather than a strictly legal or forensic transfer of guilt.

- "Sin is not only the guilt of individuals, but the fate of the world estranged from God." ("The Coming of God")

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- The Coming of God (1995)
- God in Creation (1985)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Solidarity and Estrangement**
    - Views **original sin** as a condition of alienation from God and others, not merely inherited guilt.
    - Emphasizes the communal and historical nature of sin, rooted in **solidarity** with fallen humanity.
    - Rejects a purely individualistic or legalistic understanding of sin’s transmission.
    - Connects sin to the structures and systems that perpetuate suffering and injustice.
    - "Original sin is the experience of being born into a world in which God is absent and death reigns." ("The Coming of God")

2. **Christ’s Solidarity with Humanity**
    - Sees Christ’s incarnation and crucifixion as the ultimate act of **solidarity** with sinful humanity.
    - Christ assumes the consequences of sin, entering into the depths of human estrangement.
    - Redemption is not merely forensic but participatory and transformative.
    - The cross is the locus where God identifies with the lostness of the world.
    - "In the cross, God himself enters into the situation of godforsakenness and death." ("The Crucified God")

3. **Imputation as Participation, Not Legal Transfer**
    - Rejects a strictly **forensic imputation** of Adam’s guilt or Christ’s righteousness.
    - Emphasizes **participation** in Christ’s death and resurrection as the means of justification.
    - The believer is drawn into the new humanity inaugurated by Christ, not merely declared righteous.
    - Imputation is relational and transformative, not external or merely declarative.
    - "Justification means participation in the righteousness of Christ, not the transfer of a legal status." ("The Trinity and the Kingdom")

4. **Eschatological Reorientation of Sin and Redemption**
    - Frames sin and redemption within the context of **eschatological hope**.
    - The defeat of sin is tied to the coming **kingdom of God** and the renewal of creation.
    - The effects of original sin are overcome not only in individual salvation but in cosmic restoration.
    - Redemption is forward-looking, anticipating the liberation of all creation.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the anticipation of the new creation in which sin and death are overcome." ("The Coming of God")

5. **Trinitarian Foundation for Anthropology and Sin**
    - Grounds human identity and sinfulness in the **relational life of the Trinity**.
    - Sin is a rupture of the communion intended by the triune God.
    - Restoration involves being drawn into the fellowship of Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - Anthropology is defined by openness to God’s future, not by inherited guilt alone.
    - "Human beings are created for the community of the triune God, and sin is the loss of this community." ("The Trinity and the Kingdom")

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach to **original sin** and **imputation** has significantly influenced contemporary theology, especially in ecumenical and liberationist circles. By reframing these doctrines in terms of **solidarity**, **participation**, and **eschatological hope**, he has challenged traditional Reformed and Augustinian paradigms. His work has encouraged theologians to consider the communal, historical, and cosmic dimensions of sin and redemption, fostering dialogue across confessional lines. Moltmann’s legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the relationship between **systemic evil**, human responsibility, and the transformative work of Christ.
