### TITLE
Radical Corruption and Real Responsibility: Defending Reformed Total Depravity and Total Inability

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How can human sin be so pervasive and incapacitating that fallen people are in **total inability** to turn to God, while they remain morally responsible, and God remains just, good, and sincere in his commands and gospel offers.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Jonathan Edwards.
- Relevant traditions: Augustinian and medieval Catholic accounts of grace and nature, Reformation and post-Reformation **Reformed** theology, in contrast to Pelagian and semi-Pelagian streams including Arminian and later Wesleyan critiques.
- Debates addressed:
  - Internal: nuances among Augustinian, Reformed scholastic, and later Reformed evangelical articulations of **total depravity** and the nature of **free will** and moral inability.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian denials, synergistic Arminian and Roman Catholic positions, and libertarian free will theories.
  - Contemporary: analytic-philosophical challenges about responsibility and determinism, pastoral and missional worries about evangelism and assurance, and accusations that the doctrine destroys human dignity or renders God monstrous.
- Defended position: A classic Reformed view that original sin issues in **total depravity** and **total moral inability**, such that saving faith is solely the effect of monergistic **effectual calling** and **irresistible grace**, yet human responsibility and divine justice are preserved through **compatibilist freedom** and **federal representation** in Adam and Christ.

### ESSAY
Total depravity and total inability state that in Adam all humans are so radically corrupted that every faculty is disordered, so that apart from regenerating grace they are unable to respond savingly to God. The doctrine does not claim that humans are as bad as they could possibly be, nor that they lack rational, emotional, or volitional capacity in a general sense. Instead it affirms a specific, Godward, moral and spiritual impotence: fallen people cannot, will not, and do not desire to repent and believe the gospel unless God first and efficaciously changes their hearts. Under oral examination you will be pressed to hold together several tensions: that this corruption is comprehensive but not annihilating of the imago Dei, that inability is moral not physical, that responsibility remains intact, that divine sovereignty and human agency are compatible, and that God is neither the author of sin nor unjust in condemning those who cannot do otherwise in the relevant moral sense. To defend the Reformed position requires deep engagement with Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and Edwards, and situating their work amidst Pelagian, semi-Pelagian, and Arminian alternatives.

Augustine is the decisive starting point, because in his anti-Pelagian writings he reframes the question from isolated acts to the state of the will. Against Pelagius, who held that grace was largely external help and example and that humans retained the plenary power to obey or disobey God’s commands without interior renewal, Augustine argued that humanity after Adam is bound by a **massa perditionis**, a mass of perdition. In works like On the Spirit and the Letter and On Nature and Grace Augustine insists that fallen humans possess a will but lack **rectitude of will**. The will is not destroyed but vitiated. This is the conceptual seed of **moral inability**: we do what we want, but what we want is evil. Augustine’s fourfold state schema, later systematized by Reformed scholastics, is already germinal: before the fall, posse peccare et non peccare; after the fall, non posse non peccare; in grace, posse non peccare; in glory, non posse peccare. Examiners may press whether Augustine really teaches a later Reformed version of total depravity, since he retains some concept of “pale remains” of free choice. You must answer that for Augustine, remaining freedom is freedom in the civil and natural spheres, not freedom for God. He is clear that without prevenient grace no one even begins to will the good of turning to God. His doctrine of **predestinating grace** is explicitly monergistic: grace does not respond to foreseen faith, but produces the faith it finds, thereby grounding what will later be called **irresistible grace**.

Thomas Aquinas inherits Augustine’s basic commitments yet articulates them within a more elaborate nature–grace and intellect–will framework. Aquinas does not use the terminology of “total depravity,” yet his doctrine of original sin includes a deep corruption of human nature in which the lower appetites rebel against reason and the will is turned away from God as final end. For Aquinas, nature is wounded, not destroyed. Even after the fall, humans retain natural knowledge of God as creator and some capacity for civil virtue. This is close to what the Reformed later call **common grace**. But on matters of supernatural good, Aquinas is Augustinian: the will must be moved by God for any act of charity or meritorious turning to him. Grace is intrinsically necessary, not merely helpful. The critical divergence with the Reformed is not at the level of corruption but at the architecture of grace and cooperation. In Aquinas, grace is both prevenient and cooperative; the will, moved by God, truly co-acts with him. Classical Thomism affirms that God’s motion is efficacious and infallibly brings about the free act, a version of **compatibilism**. Yet in post-Tridentine Roman Catholicism and in various later readings of Thomas, synergistic and semi-Pelagian tendencies reemerge, softening the sense of inability with a more symmetrical role for prevenient grace enabling a libertarian choice. Under examination you must be able to state that in its strongest form Thomism shares with the Reformed the insistence that fallen nature cannot even begin to will the supernatural good without an interior divine motion, though the Reformed will press further in tying this to unconditional election and the limited scope of regenerating grace.

Luther is decisive because he makes the bondage of the will the explicit battleground of the Reformation. In The Bondage of the Will (1525) against Erasmus, Luther rejects the notion that after the fall the human will retains a neutral power to choose good or evil. For Luther, the will is not an independent faculty poised between alternatives; it is always the captive of a lord, either God or Satan. Luther’s concept of **servum arbitrium**, enslaved will, does not deny voluntary action; it denies the will’s spiritual self-determining power regarding God. This is an explicit embrace of what later will be named **total inability**. When examiners ask whether this annihilates responsibility, you must trace Luther’s insistence that inability does not excuse, because the inability is itself culpable. Humans are not coerced into sinning against their desires; they love darkness. Their bondage is self-chosen in Adam and continually ratified in their own acts. Luther thereby aligns with Augustine but with sharper antithesis: even the best works of the unregenerate are splendid vices, lacking true righteousness because they do not arise from faith and love of God.

John Calvin systematizes and deepens this Augustinian–Lutheran trajectory within a broader doctrinal architecture. In the Institutes, particularly book 2, Calvin expounds **total depravity** as the pervasive corruption of intellect, affections, and will. He insists that after the fall the mind is a factory of idols, the heart is deceitful, and the will is in bondage to sin. Yet he carefully preserves the distinction between absolute destruction and extensive corruption. Fallen people can still reason, choose, and perform socially beneficial acts, because of God’s preserving providence and **common grace**, but with respect to any motion toward God, they are spiritually dead. For Calvin, **total inability** means that “man is so enslaved by the yoke of sin, that he cannot of his own nature aim at good either in wish or actual pursuit.” This is anchored in federal and covenantal representation: in Adam all sinned and all became liable not only to guilt but to a depraved nature. Examiners will likely ask whether Calvin teaches physical or moral inability. The answer is that Calvin, like later Reformed, is explicit that the inability is moral and spiritual, not natural. Humans have physical and rational powers, but they are turned against God. Therefore the commands of God reveal not what we are now able to perform in our own strength but what we ought to do and what we were created to do. The function of the law in its elenctic use is to expose this impotence and drive us to Christ.

Jonathan Edwards represents a mature Reformed response to philosophical objections against total depravity and inability. In Freedom of the Will (1754), Edwards develops a robust distinction between **natural ability** and **moral inability**. Natural ability is the possession of the faculties required to act: reason, capacity, bodily powers. Moral inability is the absence of the right disposition or inclination to perform certain actions. He argues that sinners are under no natural inability to repent and believe; they have legs to walk to church, ears to hear, minds to understand the content of the gospel. Their inability is that they will not, because their strongest motive is always toward self and sin rather than God. Edwards’s central claim is that the will is determined by the strongest motive as perceived by the person, and that such motives are a function of the person’s character or disposition. This yields a sophisticated **compatibilist freedom**: people are free when they act according to their own desires and without external compulsion, even if those desires are themselves determined by prior character and divine decree. Edwards thus shields divine sovereignty and **effectual calling** from the charge of coercion, while insisting that the unregenerate cannot but sin because they love sin. Under examination you must show how Edwards’s framework protects responsibility: moral inability does not excuse because it coincides with what the person most deeply wants. A man who cannot love God because he hates God is not thereby exonerated. His inability is itself his crime.

Within the Reformed tradition there are internal debates about the extent and expression of **total depravity**. All confessional Reformed theologians affirm pervasive depravity and inability, but they differ in explaining the noetic effects of sin, the residual goodness of human nature, and the relation of depravity to the image of God. Some, following a stricter reading of Calvin and later Puritanism, speak of the imago Dei as effaced with only a damaged vestige remaining, while others emphasize that the structural image remains though its moral orientation is ruined. This internal diversity surfaces in differing pastoral tones: some presentations of total depravity can veer toward a denial of any human dignity, while others insist that depravity presupposes a good created nature now corrupted. To satisfy examiners, you must hold the crucial balance: humans remain image bearers with inherent worth, yet that very capacity and calling are now twisted against God so that every act of the unregenerate misses the true end of glorifying him.

Another internal debate concerns the ordo salutis and the relation of **effectual calling**, **regeneration**, and faith. Classic Reformed theology teaches that because of total inability, regeneration must logically precede the first act of saving faith. If examiners challenge that this makes faith unnecessary or automatic, you must answer that regeneration is the renewal of the heart’s disposition that infallibly but noncoercively yields faith. The Spirit gives a new principle of life, enlightening the mind and inclining the will; the sinner then freely believes, yet that very freedom is the fruit of sovereign grace. Some contemporary Reformed evangelicals, influenced by broader evangelical synergism, attempt to soften this by speaking of a “prevenient drawing” extended to all, which can be resisted or embraced libertarianly. But such moves erode the Reformed logic: if grace is equally provided to all and the decisive factor lies in self-originating choice, then **total inability** has been relinquished and human boasting reintroduced. A consistent Reformed position insists that inability is overcome only by a discriminating, efficacious work of the Spirit grounded in unconditional election.

Externally, Pelagian and semi-Pelagian positions explicitly reject total depravity and inability. Pelagius denied original guilt and insisted that each soul is created in the same moral condition as Adam before the fall, with full power to obey God’s commands. He interpreted divine commands as proof of native ability: “if I ought, therefore I can.” This is a direct denial of moral inability. Semi-Pelagianism concedes a general weakness from Adam yet insists that the first movement toward God lies in the human will, which grace then assists. The Council of Orange (529) condemned this and affirmed the necessity of prevenient grace even for the beginning of faith, aligning more closely with Augustine. Yet subsequent medieval and modern developments often slide back toward semi-Pelagian assumptions by treating grace as a generic enabling given to all, rendering the decisive difference to lie in libertarian human response. Arminianism and later Wesleyan theology formalize this: they affirm original sin and a kind of total depravity, but posit a universal **prevenient grace** that restores libertarian free will sufficiently to allow all sinners to accept or reject the gospel. The Reformed critique is that this renders election conditional upon foreseen faith and empties the doctrine of inability of real effect. If all are equally enabled, then the ground of differentiation is within the sinner, not in God’s gracious choice.

Philosophically, libertarian free will theories challenge the Reformed doctrine by claiming that moral responsibility requires the ability to do otherwise in the categorical sense. If God’s eternal decree and efficacious grace determine the human will, then, they argue, no one can be responsible or blameworthy. Edwards and later Reformed thinkers answer that what responsibility requires is not alternative possibilities but the ownership of one’s desires and actions. So long as agents act according to their character and without external coercion, they are responsible. Scripture itself, particularly Paul in Romans 9, anticipates the libertarian objection: “Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?” Paul does not resolve this by appealing to human autonomous power; he insists on divine **sovereignty** and the Creator–creature distinction: “Who are you, O man, to answer back to God?” The Reformed position thus grounds its account of responsibility not in libertarian indeterminism but in **analogical knowledge** of God’s justice and in the fact that God, who defines justice, declares sinners guilty, unable, and yet culpable.

Contemporary debates also probe the pastoral and missional implications of total depravity and inability. Critics within evangelicalism worry that the doctrine undermines evangelistic urgency: if sinners cannot respond unless elect and regenerated, why preach passionately and indiscriminately? The Reformed answer is twofold. First, God ordains the means as well as the ends; the preaching of the gospel is the appointed instrument by which the Spirit effectually calls his elect. Second, because no one can save himself, the urgency is intensified, not diminished: people stand on a precipice without any capacity to back away; only the external word and internal Spirit can rescue them. Others fear that the doctrine produces spiritual passivity or fatalism in believers. Here the doctrine must be joined with adjacent loci, especially **sanctification** and **perseverance of the saints**, to emphasize that while initial faith is monergistic, sanctification involves Spirit-enabled, synergistic activity of the renewed believer. Total depravity describes the pre-regenerate state; in Christ, the believer is a new creation and genuinely capable, by grace, of obeying God.

Another modern critique charges that total depravity assaults human dignity and fuels psychological shame. Under examination, you should distinguish between ontological dignity and ethical condition. As image bearers, all humans possess irremovable worth and capacities reflecting God. Total depravity does not negate this; it asserts that those dignified faculties are misdirected. In fact, the depth of our corruption is parasitic upon the greatness of our created status. The doctrine, rightly preached, strips false confidence but simultaneously magnifies the sufficiency and freeness of grace. It undercuts self-loathing by relocating hope entirely in Christ’s **federal headship** and righteousness, not in any residual native goodness.

A more severe contemporary objection is moral: if God creates people who are totally unable to believe unless he grants regenerating grace, and he does not grant this to all, then is God not unjust or unloving? Here the Reformed must press the distinction between justice and mercy. Justice requires that God give to each what is due. In Adam all receive guilt, corruption, and condemnation, because Adam stands as covenant representative. That order, **federal theology**, is already on display in Romans 5: in Adam all die; in Christ the many are made righteous. No one receives injustice if left in their sin; some receive mercy in Christ. The asymmetry between damnation and salvation is crucial: reprobation is a passing over and condemnation for demerit; election is unconditional favor. If examiners confront you with the intuition that it would be more loving for God to give equal saving opportunity to all, you must reply that equal opportunity under original sin is no hope at all. If God merely restores libertarian freedom and leaves the decisive step to fallen wills, the cross becomes assistance rather than substitution and grace is no longer effectual. The Reformed doctrine locates the sinner’s only hope in God’s unilateral action to overcome **total inability** through union with Christ by the Spirit.

This doctrine interlocks with other loci and must be defended in that systemic context. With respect to **Christology**, total depravity underscores the necessity of the incarnation of a sinless second Adam whose human nature is not derived by ordinary generation and therefore not implicated in Adamic guilt. With respect to **atonement**, it supports a definite atonement that not only makes salvation possible but actually secures faith and repentance for the elect for whom Christ died. With respect to **pneumatology**, it highlights the sovereign, life-giving role of the Spirit who alone can illumine minds darkened by sin and free wills enslaved to corruption. And with respect to **eschatology**, it anticipates the final state in which moral inability is reversed: the saints will be confirmed in righteousness, non posse peccare, while the wicked will be fixed in their chosen rebellion.

In defending total depravity and total inability before examiners, your central move must always be to insist that Scripture binds us to an anthropology in which sin is not superficial but radical, in which human freedom is real but creaturely and **compatibilist**, and in which grace is not a gentle offer awaiting autonomous acceptance but a resurrecting power that raises the dead. Augustine diagnoses the disease, Aquinas shows that nature is wounded yet still nature, Luther hammers the bondage of the will, Calvin orders the doctrine around federal headship and monergistic grace, and Edwards gives the metaphysical tools to answer modern concerns about freedom and responsibility. The Reformed position you must own is that humanity is truly and totally unable to come to Christ apart from sovereign grace, that this inability increases rather than diminishes guilt, and that the glory of the gospel is precisely that God, who justly commands what we cannot perform, also in Christ graciously gives what he commands.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Total depravity** is the pervasive corruption of every human faculty in Adam, and **total inability** is the consequent moral and spiritual incapacity of fallen humans to turn to God or exercise saving faith apart from regenerating, **effectual grace**, while retaining natural powers and full responsibility.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: anti-Pelagian, grounds moral inability and predestinating grace in Adamic guilt and the bound will.
  - Aquinas: nature wounded not destroyed, affirms need for prevenient and efficacious motion of God for supernatural good, though later read more synergistically.
  - Luther: servum arbitrium, will always enslaved to sin or God, heightens the antithesis and rejects any neutral free will.
  - Calvin: systematizes **total depravity**, ties it to **federal theology**, insists on moral not physical inability and on monergistic regeneration.
  - Edwards: sharp natural–moral ability distinction, develops **compatibilist freedom** and motive-based account of responsibility to defend inability.
- Debates:
  - Internal: extent of corruption of the imago Dei, exact relation of regeneration and faith, degree of noetic effects of sin, and pastoral tone in presenting depravity.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian denials of original sin and inability, Arminian and Wesleyan **prevenient grace** and libertarian freedom, and Roman Catholic synergism.
  - Contemporary: analytic concerns about determinism and responsibility, missional worries about evangelism and assurance, and ethical protests about God’s justice and love.
- Defended position: Classic Reformed view that fallen humans are under **total moral inability** to respond savingly to God, that this inability is culpable and rooted in **federal representation** in Adam, and that salvation is solely due to God’s sovereign, monergistic, **irresistible grace** in Christ applied by the Spirit, compatible with real human responsibility.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does total inability destroy responsibility? Answer: No, because the inability is moral, coinciding with what the sinner wants, and Scripture holds people responsible for what they love and choose.
  - How is God just to condemn those who cannot do otherwise? Answer: Their inability flows from Adamic guilt and their own willing love of sin; reprobation gives them what they deserve, while election shows undeserved mercy.
  - What about “whosoever will may come”? Answer: All who will may truly come, but only those whom the Spirit has first renewed will, so the universal call is sincere while the response is grace-enabled.
  - Does this doctrine undercut evangelism? Answer: It grounds evangelism as God’s chosen means to raise the spiritually dead, guaranteeing that the gospel will be effective for the elect.
  - How do you distinguish total depravity from utter depravity? Answer: Total depravity is extent, not degree; every faculty is corrupted, but no person is as evil as possible, due to **common grace** and remaining created goodness.
