# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the doctrine of **total depravity** through his existential analysis of the **human condition**, emphasizing **estrangement** and **alienation** from the **Ground of Being**. He reframed **total inability** not as a metaphysical incapacity, but as humanity's existential inability to overcome its own **sinful state** apart from **divine grace**.

- "Sin is separation. To be in the state of sin is to be in the state of separation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

- The Protestant Era

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Existential Estrangement**
    - Sin is fundamentally a state of **estrangement** from God, self, and others.
    - This estrangement is universal and affects every aspect of human existence.
    - Tillich interprets **original sin** as the existential condition of separation, not merely a moral failing.
    - The depth of estrangement makes self-redemption impossible.
    - "Sin is not a mere moral act; it is a state of being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Total Inability as Existential Powerlessness**
    - Human beings are powerless to overcome their separation from the **Ground of Being** by their own efforts.
    - This inability is rooted in the existential structure of human existence, not just in willful rebellion.
    - Only **divine grace** can bridge the gap of estrangement.
    - Human freedom is real but always exercised within the limits of this existential condition.
    - "Man is unable to break through his separation by his own power." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Universal Scope of Depravity**
    - All people participate in the state of estrangement; there are no exceptions.
    - This universality is not just empirical but ontological, grounded in the structure of existence.
    - The **ambiguity of existence** means even the best human actions are tainted by separation.
    - The universality of sin points to the need for a universal solution in **reconciliation**.
    - "There is no man who is not under the conditions of estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Grace as the Only Solution**
    - Human efforts, including religion and morality, cannot overcome total depravity.
    - **Grace** is the act of God that reunites the estranged with the Ground of Being.
    - This grace is both **justifying** and **transforming**, enabling new being.
    - The reception of grace is existentially necessary for salvation.
    - "Grace is the acceptance of that which is rejected." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

5. **Symbolic Interpretation of Biblical Categories**
    - Tillich interprets **sin**, **depravity**, and **inability** as symbols pointing to existential realities.
    - He avoids literalist or forensic readings of traditional doctrines.
    - The biblical language of "death" and "bondage" expresses the depth of human estrangement.
    - Symbolic language allows for a contemporary appropriation of ancient doctrines.
    - "The symbols of religion point beyond themselves to the ultimate concern." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **total depravity** and **total inability** influenced modern theology by shifting the focus from legal guilt to **ontological estrangement**. His work provided a bridge between classical doctrines and contemporary existential questions, making traditional categories accessible to modern audiences. While some critics argue that his symbolic approach dilutes the seriousness of sin, Tillich’s emphasis on **grace** and the depth of human need continues to shape discussions in systematic theology and philosophical theology.
