# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin taught that **total depravity** is the pervasive corruption of human nature resulting from the Fall, affecting every aspect of the person—mind, will, and affections. He asserted that this depravity leads to **total inability**, meaning that apart from the regenerating work of the **Holy Spirit**, fallen humans are utterly incapable of turning to God or performing any truly good work.

- "For our nature is not only utterly devoid of goodness, but so prolific in all kinds of evil, that it can never be idle." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 2.1.8)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 1–5)
- Commentary on Romans (notably Romans 3 and 5)
- Commentary on Genesis (Genesis 6:5)
- Sermons on Ephesians (Ephesians 2:1–5)
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill (secondary reference)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Comprehensive Corruption of Human Nature**
    - Every faculty—intellect, will, and affections—is corrupted by sin.
    - Sin is not merely an external act but a deep-seated condition.
    - There is no part of the human person untouched by depravity.
    - Even the best human works are tainted by sin.
    - "All parts of the soul were possessed by sin, and so the whole man was, as it were, drowned in a deluge." (Institutes 2.1.9)

2. **Bondage of the Will**
    - The human will is not free but enslaved to sin.
    - Fallen humans cannot will or choose spiritual good apart from grace.
    - True freedom is only restored through regeneration.
    - The will follows the dictates of a corrupt nature.
    - "Man by nature inclines to evil, and his whole mind is so entirely alienated from the righteousness of God that he can conceive, desire, or attempt nothing but what is impious, perverted, foul, impure, and infamous." (Institutes 2.2.26)

3. **Necessity of Regeneration**
    - Regeneration is essential for any movement toward God.
    - The Holy Spirit alone can renew the heart and will.
    - No one can come to faith without being born again.
    - Regeneration precedes faith and repentance.
    - "The will is not restored to liberty, except as it is made subject to God and actuated by his Spirit." (Institutes 2.3.6)

4. **Inability to Merit Salvation**
    - Fallen humans cannot earn or contribute to their salvation.
    - All attempts at righteousness apart from Christ are futile.
    - Salvation is entirely by **grace** through faith.
    - Human works are insufficient and polluted by sin.
    - "We are so entirely controlled by the power of sin, that the whole mind, the whole heart, and all our actions are under its influence." (Institutes 2.3.2)

5. **Divine Initiative in Salvation**
    - God must take the first step in salvation.
    - Election and effectual calling are rooted in God's sovereign grace.
    - Human response is enabled only by God's prior work.
    - The glory of salvation belongs to God alone.
    - "The Lord, therefore, begins the good work in us, and carries it forward by his own power." (Institutes 2.3.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** became foundational for the Reformed tradition and shaped later confessional standards such as the Canons of Dort and the Westminster Confession. His emphasis on the necessity of **sovereign grace** and the utter dependence of sinners on divine initiative continues to influence Reformed soteriology and debates on human freedom. Calvin’s legacy endures in both academic theology and the practical preaching of the gospel, underscoring the radical nature of human sin and the absolute necessity of grace.
