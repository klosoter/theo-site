# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner, a leading figure in **dialectical theology**, affirmed the reality of **human sinfulness** but nuanced the doctrines of **total depravity** and **total inability**. While he agreed that the **image of God** in humanity is profoundly marred by sin, Brunner insisted that a "formal" capacity for **divine encounter** remains, enabling a genuine response to God's **revelation**. Thus, he rejected the notion that sin renders humans utterly incapable of responding to God, emphasizing instead the relational aspect of **grace**.

- "Sin does not destroy the formal possibility of relation to God, but it does destroy the material possibility." (Man in Revolt)

## Key Works

- Man in Revolt (1937)
- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- Dogmatics, Vol. 2: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (1952)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Revelation and Reason (1946)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Disruption, Not Annihilation, of the Imago Dei**
    - Affirms that **sin** radically corrupts but does not obliterate the **image of God** in humanity.
    - Distinguishes between the "formal" and "material" aspects of the **imago Dei**.
    - The formal aspect (capacity for relation) persists; the material aspect (actual fellowship) is lost.
    - This distinction undergirds his critique of classical **total inability**.
    - "The image of God is destroyed in its material content, but not in its formal possibility." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Human Responsibility and Divine Initiative**
    - Maintains that humans remain responsible for their response to **God's revelation**.
    - Stresses that God's initiative is always primary in **salvation**.
    - Rejects Pelagianism but also resists deterministic readings of **total depravity**.
    - Emphasizes the dialogical nature of the **divine-human encounter**.
    - "God addresses man as a responsible being, even in his sin." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

3. **Grace as Relational, Not Mechanical**
    - Views **grace** as a personal encounter, not an impersonal force.
    - Argues that grace restores the possibility of genuine relationship with God.
    - Opposes notions of grace that negate human response or freedom.
    - Sees **faith** as a relational response enabled by grace, not coerced.
    - "Grace does not violate the person; it awakens response." (The Mediator)

4. **Critique of Classical Reformed Total Inability**
    - Challenges the idea that humans are utterly incapable of responding to God.
    - Argues that the **formal capacity** for God remains after the Fall.
    - Sees the classical doctrine as undermining genuine **responsibility**.
    - Proposes a more dynamic, existential understanding of **sin** and **freedom**.
    - "Even in sin, man is still addressed by God and can respond." (Man in Revolt)

5. **Revelation as Event, Not Proposition**
    - Emphasizes **revelation** as a living encounter, not mere doctrinal information.
    - Believes that God's Word confronts the sinner and calls for response.
    - Rejects any view that treats revelation as a static deposit.
    - Stresses the existential impact of revelation on the human will.
    - "Revelation is always an event in which God meets man." (Revelation and Reason)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s nuanced approach to **total depravity** and **total inability** influenced later debates within **neo-orthodoxy** and beyond, especially regarding the nature of the **imago Dei** and human responsibility. His insistence on the relational and dialogical character of **grace** challenged both Reformed and liberal paradigms, prompting renewed reflection on the balance between divine sovereignty and human response. Brunner’s work remains significant for those seeking a mediating position between classical Reformed anthropology and existentialist concerns.
