# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the question of **human sinfulness** and **grace** through the lens of his **transcendental anthropology**, emphasizing the universal orientation of humanity toward God while acknowledging the radical reality of sin. While he did not use the Reformed categories of **total depravity** or **total inability**, Rahner argued that all humans are marked by a profound estrangement from God, yet remain always already graced by God’s **supernatural existential**.

- "Man is always already the being who is offered God’s self-communication." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Foundations of Christian Faith (Grundkurs des Glaubens)
- Theological Investigations (multiple volumes)
- Nature and Grace: Dilemmas in the Modern Church
- Hearer of the Word
- Spirit in the World

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Supernatural Existential**
   - Every human is endowed with a supernatural orientation toward God.
   - This existential is not earned but is a permanent offer of **grace**.
   - Human nature is always already graced, even before explicit faith.
   - Sin does not erase this orientation but distorts its fulfillment.
   - "The supernatural existential is the radical presupposition of all human existence." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Sin as Radical Estrangement**
   - Sin is a fundamental turning away from God, affecting all aspects of human life.
   - Rahner affirms the universality of sin but avoids the language of absolute corruption.
   - Sin is personal and existential, not merely inherited guilt.
   - Despite sin, the possibility of responding to grace remains.
   - "Sin is the free and personal act of rejecting the offer of God’s self-communication." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Freedom and Responsibility**
   - Human beings retain genuine freedom even in their fallen state.
   - This freedom is always exercised within the context of grace.
   - Total inability is rejected in favor of a dynamic interplay between grace and freedom.
   - Human response to God is possible, though always enabled by grace.
   - "Man is always both free and graced, never one without the other." (Theological Investigations)

4. **Transcendental Anthropology**
   - Human beings are defined by their openness to the infinite, to God.
   - This openness is the basis for the possibility of revelation and grace.
   - Sin clouds but does not destroy this fundamental orientation.
   - The human subject is always the 'hearer of the Word.'
   - "Man is the being who hears the Word of God, even if he does not recognize it as such." (Hearer of the Word)

5. **Rejection of Pure Nature**
   - Rahner denies a state of pure nature without grace.
   - All human existence is marked by the supernatural existential.
   - There is no moment in which humans are simply left to their own natural powers.
   - This view challenges traditional distinctions between nature and grace.
   - "There is no real man who is not always already graced." (Nature and Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s reinterpretation of **original sin** and human inability has profoundly shaped modern Catholic theology, especially in discussions of **grace** and **anthropology**. His concept of the supernatural existential provided a new framework for understanding the universality of grace without denying the seriousness of sin. Rahner’s influence is evident in Vatican II and in ongoing debates about the relationship between **nature and grace**. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking to articulate a theology of sin and grace that is both faithful to tradition and responsive to contemporary questions.
