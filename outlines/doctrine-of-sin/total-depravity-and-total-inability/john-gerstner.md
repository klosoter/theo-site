# John Gerstner (1914–1996)

John Gerstner was a staunch defender of **Reformed orthodoxy**, emphasizing the doctrines of **total depravity** and **total inability** as central to the human condition after the Fall. He argued that apart from **regenerating grace**, fallen humanity is utterly incapable of turning to God or performing any truly good act, thus highlighting the necessity of **sovereign grace** in salvation.

- "Man’s will is free to choose, but it is always determined by his nature, and since his nature is corrupt, he is unable to choose God." (Wrongly Dividing the Word of Truth)

## Key Works

- The Rational Biblical Theology of Jonathan Edwards (especially Vol. 2)
- Wrongly Dividing the Word of Truth
- Theology of the Major Sects
- Jonathan Edwards: A Mini-Theology
- Repent or Perish

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Comprehensive Corruption**
    - Humanity’s entire being—mind, will, and affections—is corrupted by sin.
    - There is no part of human nature left untouched by the Fall.
    - Even the best human actions are tainted by sin and cannot please God.
    - This corruption is not merely partial but extends to all faculties.
    - "Total depravity means that every aspect of man’s nature is affected by sin." (Wrongly Dividing the Word of Truth)

2. **Total Inability to Respond to God**
    - Fallen humans are incapable of initiating or contributing to their own salvation.
    - The will is in bondage to sin and cannot choose spiritual good apart from grace.
    - Moral inability, not natural inability, prevents sinners from coming to Christ.
    - Only the Holy Spirit can overcome this inability through regeneration.
    - "The sinner cannot because he will not, and he will not because he cannot." (Wrongly Dividing the Word of Truth)

3. **Necessity of Sovereign Grace**
    - Salvation is entirely a work of God from beginning to end.
    - Grace is not merely helpful but absolutely necessary for any movement toward God.
    - Regeneration precedes faith and repentance in the ordo salutis.
    - Human effort or decision plays no causal role in the new birth.
    - "Grace is not an aid to the sinner; it is his only hope." (The Rational Biblical Theology of Jonathan Edwards)

4. **Rejection of Semi-Pelagianism and Arminianism**
    - Any doctrine that attributes a positive role to human will in salvation is rejected.
    - Semi-Pelagian and Arminian views are seen as undermining the seriousness of sin.
    - Gerstner critiques synergistic soteriologies as inconsistent with Scripture.
    - He insists that only monergism preserves the glory of God’s grace.
    - "To say that man can cooperate with grace is to deny the depth of his depravity." (Wrongly Dividing the Word of Truth)

5. **Edwardsian Anthropology**
    - He draws heavily on Jonathan Edwards’s analysis of the will and affections.
    - The will always follows the strongest inclination, which in fallen man is always away from God.
    - True freedom is not the ability to choose contrary to one’s nature, but to act according to a renewed nature.
    - Gerstner uses Edwards to defend the Reformed understanding of human inability.
    - "Edwards showed that the sinner’s inability is moral, not metaphysical." (The Rational Biblical Theology of Jonathan Edwards)

## Legacy and Impact

Gerstner’s rigorous defense of **total depravity** and **total inability** shaped generations of Reformed pastors, scholars, and laypeople, especially through his influence on figures like R.C. Sproul. His polemics against **Arminianism** and his retrieval of **Edwardsian anthropology** reinforced the distinctives of classic Calvinism in twentieth-century American evangelicalism. Gerstner’s writings remain a resource for those seeking a robust articulation of the necessity of **sovereign grace** in salvation.
