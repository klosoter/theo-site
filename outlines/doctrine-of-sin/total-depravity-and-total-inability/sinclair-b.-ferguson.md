# Sinclair Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair Ferguson affirms the classic Reformed doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability**, emphasizing that humanity’s fallen condition affects every aspect of the person and renders individuals utterly incapable of turning to God apart from **sovereign grace**. He situates these doctrines within the broader framework of **original sin** and the necessity of **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit, highlighting the pervasive effects of sin on the will, mind, and affections.

- "The doctrine of total depravity does not mean that every person is as bad as he or she could possibly be, but that sin has affected every part of our being." (The Christian Life)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Radical Corruption**
    - Humanity’s nature is corrupted in every faculty—mind, will, and affections—by **original sin**.
    - This corruption is inherited from Adam and is universal among all people.
    - Total depravity does not mean utter depravity, but that no part of the person is untouched by sin.
    - The image of God remains, but is marred and distorted by the fall.
    - "Sin is not merely an action, but a condition that affects the whole person." (The Christian Life)

2. **Total Inability to Respond to God**
    - Fallen humans are incapable of choosing or desiring God apart from **divine initiative**.
    - The will is in bondage to sin and cannot free itself.
    - Saving faith is impossible without the prior work of the Holy Spirit.
    - Moral inability is distinguished from physical inability; the problem is not lack of faculties, but lack of desire and ability to use them rightly.
    - "We are not merely sick, but dead in trespasses and sins, and need to be made alive by God." (The Christian Life)

3. **Necessity of Regeneration**
    - Regeneration is the sovereign act of the Holy Spirit, granting new life to the spiritually dead.
    - Only through regeneration can a person respond in faith and repentance.
    - The new birth precedes and enables faith, not the reverse.
    - This underscores the monergistic nature of salvation in Reformed theology.
    - "The new birth is not the result of our decision, but the cause of it." (The Christian Life)

4. **Sin’s Pervasive Effects on Human Nature**
    - Sin affects intellect, emotions, conscience, and will, distorting all human faculties.
    - Even good deeds are tainted by sinful motives apart from grace.
    - The doctrine guards against both legalism and moralism by emphasizing the depth of human need.
    - The universality of sin underscores the necessity of Christ’s atoning work.
    - "Even our best works are in need of forgiveness and cleansing." (In Christ Alone)

5. **Sovereign Grace as the Only Remedy**
    - Salvation is entirely of God’s initiative and grace, not human effort.
    - The doctrines of grace (including total depravity) highlight the necessity of **effectual calling**.
    - Assurance and humility flow from recognizing salvation as God’s work from beginning to end.
    - The glory of salvation belongs to God alone, excluding all boasting.
    - "Grace is not merely God making salvation possible, but God actually saving sinners." (The Whole Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Sinclair Ferguson has played a significant role in articulating and defending the **Reformed doctrine of total depravity** for contemporary audiences, especially through his accessible teaching and pastoral writings. His work has helped clarify the distinction between total depravity and utter depravity, and has emphasized the necessity of **regeneration** and **sovereign grace** in salvation. Ferguson’s influence extends through his preaching, teaching, and editorial work, shaping both laypeople and ministers in their understanding of human sinfulness and the radical nature of God’s saving work.
