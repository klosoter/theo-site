# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of **total depravity** asserts that human nature is thoroughly corrupted by **original sin**, rendering people utterly incapable of turning to God or performing any truly good work apart from divine grace. He emphasizes **total inability**, insisting that the human will is bound and enslaved to sin, and that only the **sovereign grace of God** can liberate and regenerate the sinner. Luther’s stance is foundational for later **Reformation** understandings of human depravity and the necessity of **justification by faith alone**.

- "Free choice is nothing but a slave of sin, death, and Satan, not doing, nor able to do, anything but evil." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- Commentary on Galatians (1535)
- Luther’s Small Catechism (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Will is Bound by Sin**
    - The will is not neutral but is enslaved to sin due to the Fall.
    - Humans cannot choose or desire God apart from grace.
    - All human actions, even those outwardly good, are tainted by sin.
    - The will’s bondage is total, not partial or merely weakened.
    - "Man’s will is like a beast standing between two riders." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Original Sin Corrupts the Whole Person**
    - Sin affects every faculty: mind, heart, and will.
    - There is no spiritual good in humanity apart from God’s intervention.
    - Even reason is darkened and cannot apprehend God rightly.
    - The corruption is inherited and universal among all people.
    - "Original sin is so deep a corruption of nature that no reason can understand it." (Lectures on Romans)

3. **Divine Grace Alone Enables Salvation**
    - Salvation is initiated and completed by God’s grace, not human effort.
    - Regeneration is a work of the Holy Spirit, not the human will.
    - Faith itself is a gift, not a human achievement.
    - Grace is both necessary and sufficient for overcoming depravity.
    - "It is not in our power to think a good thought or to do a good deed." (The Bondage of the Will)

4. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is by faith, not by works or human merit.
    - Faith unites the believer to Christ, who alone is righteous.
    - Human inability underscores the necessity of Christ’s atonement.
    - Assurance rests on God’s promise, not on human performance.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, apart from the works of the law." (Commentary on Galatians)

5. **Denial of Semi-Pelagianism**
    - Rejects any cooperation between human will and grace in salvation.
    - Opposes the idea that humans can prepare themselves for grace.
    - Insists that all boasting is excluded, as salvation is entirely God’s work.
    - Affirms the utter helplessness of humanity apart from Christ.
    - "It is false to say that free-will cooperates by doing its part." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** profoundly shaped Protestant soteriology and the doctrine of grace. His polemic against **free will** in salvation influenced later Reformed and Lutheran confessions, and his insistence on the necessity of divine initiative remains central to evangelical theology. Luther’s thought continues to inform debates on the nature of sin, human freedom, and the role of grace in salvation.
