# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame affirms the doctrines of **total depravity** and **total inability** as central to the **Reformed understanding of sin and salvation**. He emphasizes that fallen humanity is thoroughly corrupted in every aspect of being, rendering people utterly unable to respond to God apart from **sovereign grace**. Frame situates these doctrines within his broader **tri-perspectival** approach, highlighting the noetic, ethical, and existential dimensions of human depravity.

- "Total depravity means that every aspect of our being is affected by sin, so that we are unable to do anything pleasing to God apart from his grace." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

## Key Works

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Comprehensive Corruption**
   - Sin affects every faculty: mind, will, emotions, and body.
   - There is no part of human nature untouched by the fall.
   - Depravity is not merely moral weakness but pervasive spiritual death.
   - Even "good" acts are tainted by sinful motives apart from regeneration.
   - "Sin is not just a matter of isolated acts, but a pervasive condition that corrupts our entire being." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Total Inability to Please God**
   - Fallen humans cannot initiate or contribute to their salvation.
   - The unregenerate are spiritually dead and hostile to God.
   - Saving faith and repentance require divine intervention.
   - Human will is in bondage to sin until liberated by the Holy Spirit.
   - "We are unable to turn to God or believe in Christ unless God first changes our hearts." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

3. **Necessity of Sovereign Grace**
   - Regeneration precedes faith and is entirely a work of God.
   - Grace is both necessary and sufficient for salvation.
   - Election is unconditional, rooted in God's mercy alone.
   - The Spirit effectually calls and enables the elect to respond.
   - "God's grace is not merely an offer but an effective power that overcomes our inability." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Tri-Perspectival Analysis of Depravity**
   - Depravity is understood normatively (God’s law), situationally (human condition), and existentially (personal experience).
   - Each perspective reveals the depth and pervasiveness of sin.
   - The tri-perspectival approach guards against reductionism in understanding sin.
   - This framework integrates biblical, theological, and practical insights.
   - "We must see sin from the standpoint of God's standards, our situation, and our personal response." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

5. **Christ Alone as the Remedy**
   - Only Christ’s atoning work can address total depravity and inability.
   - Union with Christ is essential for new life and spiritual ability.
   - Sanctification is the ongoing work of the Spirit overcoming indwelling sin.
   - Assurance rests on Christ’s sufficiency, not human effort.
   - "Our hope is not in ourselves, but in the finished work of Christ applied by the Spirit." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** has reinforced classic Reformed soteriology while integrating a uniquely tri-perspectival analysis. His work has influenced contemporary discussions on the nature of sin, grace, and human responsibility, especially within confessional and evangelical circles. Frame’s accessible yet rigorous style has made these doctrines more understandable to pastors, students, and laypeople, ensuring their continued relevance in systematic theology.
