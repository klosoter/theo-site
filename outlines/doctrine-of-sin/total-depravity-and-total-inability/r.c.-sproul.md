# R.C. Sproul (1939–2017)

R.C. Sproul was a leading Reformed theologian who vigorously defended the doctrines of **total depravity** and **total inability** as essential aspects of **original sin** and **human nature** after the Fall. He emphasized that, due to Adam's transgression, every aspect of human existence is corrupted, rendering people utterly unable to choose or do spiritual good apart from **sovereign grace**.

- "We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners." ("Chosen by God")

## Key Works

- Chosen by God (1986)
- Essential Truths of the Christian Faith (1992)
- What Is Reformed Theology? (1997)
- Grace Unknown: The Heart of Reformed Theology (1997)
- The Holiness of God (1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Radical Corruption**
    - Humanity’s fall affected every part of the person: mind, will, emotions, and body.
    - No one is left untouched by sin; all are under its power and guilt.
    - Depravity does not mean utter depravity, but that sin permeates all faculties.
    - Even the best human actions are tainted by sin and cannot merit favor with God.
    - "Total depravity means that the fall was so serious that it affects the whole person." (Chosen by God)

2. **Total Inability to Choose God**
    - Fallen humans lack the moral ability to turn to God or believe the gospel unaided.
    - The will is in bondage to sin and cannot initiate or cooperate in salvation.
    - Regeneration must precede faith; God must act first to enable belief.
    - This inability is not physical but moral and spiritual.
    - "We are spiritually dead; we cannot resurrect ourselves." (Chosen by God)

3. **Original Sin and Federal Headship**
    - Adam’s sin is imputed to all his descendants, corrupting their nature from conception.
    - The guilt and corruption of original sin are universal and inherited.
    - Federal headship explains why all are born in a state of sin and condemnation.
    - Only Christ, as the second Adam, can reverse this condition.
    - "We are born with a sinful nature because Adam acted as our representative." (Essential Truths of the Christian Faith)

4. **Necessity of Sovereign Grace**
    - Salvation is entirely a work of God’s sovereign initiative and power.
    - Grace is not merely offered but effectually applied to the elect.
    - Human will plays no role in initiating salvation; it is God who enables response.
    - This grace is irresistible and ensures the salvation of those chosen by God.
    - "If God waited for us to choose Him, He would wait forever." (What Is Reformed Theology?)

5. **Rejection of Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism**
    - Sproul strongly opposed any view that affirms human ability to cooperate with grace.
    - He identified Pelagian and semi-Pelagian views as contrary to biblical teaching and historic Reformed confessions.
    - Only the Augustinian and Reformed understanding preserves the necessity of grace.
    - Any compromise on total depravity undermines the gospel.
    - "Pelagianism is not just an error; it is heresy." (Grace Unknown)

## Legacy and Impact

Sproul’s clear articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** helped to popularize and clarify the Reformed understanding of human sinfulness for a broad evangelical audience. Through his teaching, writing, and founding of Ligonier Ministries, he shaped generations of pastors and laypeople in the doctrines of grace. His insistence on the seriousness of sin and the necessity of sovereign grace remains influential in contemporary Reformed theology. Sproul’s legacy endures in his accessible yet rigorous defense of the core tenets of the **Reformed tradition**.
