### TITLE
The will in bondage: why total depravity entails moral inability and monergistic grace

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: whether human sin so corrupts the faculties that apart from regenerating grace we possess only a moral inability to repent and believe, and how this coheres with responsibility, the imago Dei, and the free call of the gospel.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Jacob Arminius, Jonathan Edwards.
- Traditions engaged: Augustinian anti-Pelagian theology, Reformation Lutheran and Reformed soteriology, Remonstrant and Wesleyan alternatives, confessional Reformed developments at Dort and Westminster.
- Debates addressed:
  - Internal: nature and extent of corruption, civil righteousness and **common grace**, order of salvation and **effectual calling**, the well-meant offer, natural versus moral ability.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian synergism, Arminian **prevenient grace**, Roman Catholic nature–grace cooperation, libertarian freedom.
  - Contemporary: neuroscience and agency, addiction and trauma, structural sin and responsibility, evangelism and pastoral care.
- Position: I defend the classic Reformed account that **total depravity** implies universal, radical corruption issuing in **total inability** to turn to God, such that **regeneration** and **effectual calling** are **monergistic**, human freedom is **compatibilist**, and civil good is possible through **common grace** though no spiritual good Godward occurs apart from the Spirit.

### ESSAY
Total depravity names the pervasiveness and gravity of original sin: under Adam’s **federal headship**, all humanity is constituted sinners, so that every faculty is corrupted and inclined away from God. Total inability is the soteriological entailment that the unregenerate cannot, of themselves, repent and believe the gospel. Total does not mean degree of vice in every act, but extent of corruption to the root of intellect, will, and affections. The agent retains faculties and **natural ability** to choose within created goods, yet lacks **moral ability** to choose God as God. The doctrine resolves around three conceptual anchors. First, **concupiscence**, the bent of desire, disorders perception and valuation. Second, **bondage of the will**, the captivity of volition to one’s dominant love. Third, **effectual calling**, the divine act in which the Spirit liberates by a new principle of life, not by external suasion alone, supplying the very willingness that the command requires. This structure defends Scripture’s depiction of fallen man as dead in trespasses, hostile to God, unable to submit, and unable to please God, while preserving accountability and the meaningfulness of command and invitation.

Augustine established the grammar of this question in his anti-Pelagian works after the Pelagian crisis exposed a fault line between nature and grace. In Adam’s transgression, Augustine insists, the race fell into a massa perditionis, a mass of perdition, where the root of love is curved inward. **Concupiscence** is not mere bodily appetite but the systemic misordering of love. The will is not a neutral self-mover that can at every moment choose contrary to its dominant love; it is a weight that inclines toward the loved end. Against Pelagius’s claim that grace is external law and exemplar, Augustine argued that grace must be internal, changing heart and will, since otherwise Christ commands what we cannot perform, which is the case even with the regenerate apart from ongoing grace. Augustine’s anthropology is not nihilistic. He preserves the **imago Dei**, the natural powers of soul, and the civil achievements of culture, yet he maintains a strict difference between civil good and spiritual good. The unregenerate can perform acts that conform to the civil use of the law, but lacking love of God, they fail the form of virtue. His view of freedom is proto-compatibilist: freedom is the power to act according to one’s nature and love. Pre-fall freedom included a posse peccare and a posse non peccare. Post-fall humanity has only the former; only by **regeneration** in Christ is there a posse non peccare restored and in glory a non posse peccare. Augustine thereby set the conceptual agenda: original guilt and corruption through Adam’s **federal headship**, **concupiscence** as inward curvature, and the necessity of **monergistic** grace to liberate the will.

The Reformation appropriated and sharpened this heritage. Martin Luther’s The Bondage of the Will (1525), written against Erasmus’s defense of free choice, is decisive for articulating total inability with evangelical clarity. For Luther the great question is not speculative metaphysics but the certainty of grace and the glory of Christ. He reframes freedom as acting according to the inclination of the heart. Since the heart is enslaved to sin, the will cannot of itself will the opposite. Every choice is the expression of a dominated affection. The law reveals the impotence of the will by demanding what we cannot do, driving us to Christ. The gospel is not a new law but the announcement of a gift that creates what it commands. Erasmus’s appeal to biblical imperatives as evidence of ability is answered by Luther with the principle ought implies ability only if the legislator intends to expose and heal. Commands reveal duty, not native ability; God’s command magnifies grace by granting, through the Spirit, the very repentance and faith He requires. Luther’s pastoral interest is conspicuous: total inability secures that salvation is wholly in Christ and denies all boasting. If pushed on whether this makes God the author of sin, Luther draws a line between God’s **providence** and human culpability. God’s will is the primary cause, yet sin’s privation and perversity are ours. God hardens by withdrawing grace and giving men over to their chosen loves, never by infusing evil. This anticipates the later Reformed appeal to **divine concurrence** and secondary causality to shield God’s holiness while affirming meticulous sovereignty.

John Calvin systematizes this trajectory. In the Institutes and his Romans commentary, he emphasizes the noetic effects of sin and ties hamartiology to **federal theology**. In Adam all sinned, not merely by imitation but by imputation and propagation of corruption. Calvin’s distinctive contribution is twofold. First, he integrates **total depravity** with a robust doctrine of **common grace**. Fallen man retains arts, prudence, civic virtues, and the capacity for social order because God restrains sin, distributes gifts, and shines on the just and unjust. Yet none of this ascends to spiritual good. The unregenerate will always misfire on the bullseye of loving God. This distinction guards against both Manichaean denials of goodness in creation and Pelagian flattening of virtue. Second, Calvin ties inability to the ordo salutis by insisting that the external call of the gospel must be accompanied by the internal illumination of the Spirit to be efficacious. **Effectual calling** is not coercion but enlivenment. The Spirit removes the heart of stone, gives a heart of flesh, writes the law within, and grants faith as a gift. Calvin’s predestinarian framework ensures that grace is particular and invincible in the elect. Yet his doctrine of the free offer is real: God seriously calls all to repentance, revealing his benevolent disposition in the universal call, while his inscrutable counsel determines who will come. This raises an internal Reformed debate about the well-meant offer. Calvin’s own exegesis of texts like Ezekiel 18 favors affirming God’s disclosed will to the repentance of the wicked, in distinction from the secret will by which he ordains the salvation of some. The coherence of this distinction rests on **analogical knowledge** of God’s will and the Creator-creature distinction.

Against this, Jacob Arminius and the Remonstrants argue that prevenient grace universally restores the ability to believe. They affirm original sin, but deny that it entails a continued bondage that only particular grace can overcome. Prevenient grace is a universal remedy that brings the will to an equipollent state where it can accept or resist. This preserves libertarian freedom and the fairness of divine judgment. The Remonstrant articles state that grace is necessary but resistible, and that perseverance is contingent. On this scheme, total depravity does not entail total inability, because prevenient grace is coextensive with the fall and offsets it. The Reformed response, consolidated at the Synod of Dort, is that such a universal prevenient grace lacks clear biblical warrant, renders election dependent on foreseen faith, and undermines the efficacy of the atonement and the certainty of perseverance. More fundamentally, it misconstrues freedom and the nature of faith. If faith is a divine gift and spiritual act rooted in a new principle of life, then its origination is not secured by a neutralized will but by a recreated heart. The Reformed fear that the Remonstrant scheme returns to a refined semi-Pelagianism, where the first motion toward God originates in the creature, not the Creator.

Jonathan Edwards supplies the most penetrating philosophical defense of these claims. In Freedom of the Will (1754), he distinguishes **natural ability** from **moral ability**. Natural ability is the possession of the faculties requisite to an action. Moral ability is the inclination or will to perform it. Fallen humans have natural ability to perform commands like faith and repentance; they possess mind, will, and body. What they lack is moral ability, the heart’s relish for God. Edwards thereby secures responsibility without granting Pelagian powers. Moral inability does not excuse, because it is identical with the very disposition that constitutes our evil. We are not unable like a chained man is unable to walk, but like a proud man is unable to be humble. Moreover, he defends a **compatibilist** account of causation in the will. Every act of choice is determined by the greatest apparent good to the self, which is a function of the agent’s dispositions and motives. This is not determinism of external compulsion but the necessity of identity between will and strongest motive. If the heart is corrupt, the stream of volitions will be corrupt. The Spirit’s **regeneration** is the infusion of a new sense, a taste for the divine excellence, which reorders motives so that Christ appears as supremely beautiful. Faith emerges necessarily from this new sense. Edwards also defends original sin by grounding it in the identity of the race in Adam under **federal headship**, a metaphysical and covenantal unity by which God righteously imputes guilt and corruption. An examiner may press whether this conflates responsibility with causation and thereby makes sanctions unjust. Edwards replies that imputations of both Adam’s sin and Christ’s righteousness share the same covenantal structure; to deny one is to imperil the other. Scripture’s corporate ontology undergirds both condemnation in Adam and justification in Christ. The symmetry shows that federal imputation is not alien to justice but the very mode by which God exalts grace without violating equity.

With these figures, we can assess the doctrine’s coherence across loci. In anthropology, the **imago Dei** remains natural, structural, and teleological, but its moral dimension is ruined. In hamartiology, **original sin** includes both guilt and corruption. In Christology, the necessity and sufficiency of Christ’s mediatorial work presuppose the incapacity of the sinner to contribute to the cure. In pneumatology, the Spirit’s **effectual calling** and **regeneration** are not enhancements but new creation. In ecclesiology and sacramentology, the word and sacraments are means of grace precisely because they are instruments the Spirit uses to grant what they signify. In providence, **divine concurrence** governs every human act without violating the integrity of secondary causes.

Internal Reformed debates circle around three pressure points. First, the extent of **noetic effects**. Some caricature Calvinism as teaching that the mind cannot know truth. The confessional tradition replies that fallen man knows much, suppresses the truth of God, and can reason soundly within finite fields, yet cannot know God savingly without the Spirit. This undergirds confidence in natural law and civil polity without conceding spiritual capacity. Second, civil righteousness and **common grace**. The unregenerate can love family, write symphonies, and craft just laws. Yet Isaiah’s filthy rags language names the Godward defect of motive. The Reformed do not deny material virtue but its formal Godwardness. Third, the ordo salutis. Does **regeneration** precede faith or coincide with it? The best account says that regeneration, as the Spirit’s initial enlivening, is logically prior to faith as an exercise of the new life, yet temporally coincident since both are aspects of the effectual call. This protects monergism while honoring the instrumentality of faith. The free offer debate shows pastoral stake. God’s revealed will is that all should come to repentance, while his decree remains particular. Maintaining the distinction avoids either a disingenuous call or an unbiblical universalism.

External criticisms come from Pelagian, semi-Pelagian, Arminian, and Roman Catholic quarters, and from libertarian metaphysics. The Pelagian insistence on untainted nature falters before the biblical depiction of radical hostility to God and the uniform testimonies of conscience. Semi-Pelagianism, in positing an initial human motion toward God that elicits grace, misreads texts that describe faith as God’s gift and regeneration as God’s unilateral work. Arminian **prevenient grace** attempts a middle way, but it suffers exegetically and soteriologically. There is scant explicit scriptural teaching that God universally restores to every person a neutral capacity to believe. The whole tenor of John’s Gospel and Paul’s letters insists on divine drawing, teaching, opening of heart, granting of repentance, and quickening of the dead. Soteriologically, prevenience makes faith the decisive differentiator, locates it in autonomous self-determination, and thereby introduces a ground of boasting even if ever so small. Roman Catholic tradition, especially as codified at Trent, affirms original sin and the necessity of grace, yet casts grace as infused habit that enables cooperation leading to justifying works. This muddies the sharpness of inability and the gratuity of justification. If the first motion is ours, we have imported merit de congruo by the back door. Libertarian freedom’s axiom that responsibility requires power to do otherwise in the categorical sense seems intuitive, but it cannot account for divine foreknowledge except by modifying it and it fails to capture the moral phenomenology of settled vice and virtue. Scripture holds men responsible where bondage is self-incurred and love-driven. **Compatibilism** better fits biblical descriptions of the heart as fountain of action.

Contemporary challenges reframe the debate. Neuroscience suggests that choices arise from subpersonal brain processes. Addiction and trauma complicate culpability. Social structures skew agency. Does total inability trivialize these complexities or get co-opted by them into determinism? A careful account distinguishes levels. First, total inability is not neuroscientific determinism but a moral and spiritual diagnosis of love and end. It operates at the personal level of reasons and valuations, not as a denial of neural causation. Second, addictions and trauma exhibit what the tradition calls bondage. They show how agents can both be agents and yet be enslaved by patterns. The gospel engages persons where the will is wounded, not by denying responsibility but by offering a new power. Pastoral care can acknowledge diminished capacities while still calling for Spirit-wrought change. Third, structural sin does not excuse personal sin but names how pervasively the world is disordered by collective loves. **Common grace** stabilizes societies despite this disorder, while the church embodies an alternative polis. The doctrine shapes evangelism: we preach to all, command all to repent, and pray for the Spirit to grant life. It shapes counseling: we call people to repent and believe, confident that God can break chains. It shapes academic work: we expect clarity in finite fields and resistance to the knowledge of God, and so insist on **analogical knowledge** and the necessity of Scripture for saving wisdom.

Anticipating objections clarifies the doctrine’s precision. Does total depravity deny the **imago Dei**? No. It denies the righteousness and holiness component but retains natural faculties and vocation. Does inability cancel responsibility? Edwards’s distinction is decisive. Responsibility attaches to what one loves and wills. Moral inability is the very opposition of the will to God. Does the universal call become a charade? Calvin’s twofold will and the sincerity of God’s external call answer that God truly invites and commands what pleases him in the revealed will, while he sovereignly chooses to effectualize in some the very response he commands. Divine uses of means safeguard the seriousness of preaching, prayer, and pastoral persuasion. Does this doctrine make God the author of sin? The Reformed say no, because God’s decree and governance do not immediately cause evil volitions as evil. He ordains in justice to permit and govern what creatures do from their own depravity, overrules for good, and remains pure in his willing. The metaphysical tool is **divine concurrence** with secondary causes wherein God is the source of being and action while the defect of moral quality belongs to the creature. Is it unfair to impute Adam’s sin? **Federal headship** mirrors the gospel. If shared identity in Adam offends, shared identity in Christ should offend more. Scripture binds the two. Grace’s glory is that God righteously condemns in one and righteously justifies in another. No account that deprives Christ’s obedience of its imputed efficacy can save, and no account that denies Adam’s imputed guilt can explain the universality and inevitability of sin.

The doctrine forces clarity about command, promise, and prayer. God commands what we cannot do, in order to expose need and drive us to act in dependence. The promise that whoever comes will be received is universal; inability does not block that promise because God supplies willingness when he draws. Prayer for conversion presupposes inability and God’s sole sufficiency. The church’s corporate life assumes mixture and need for ongoing grace; discipline recognizes the power of sin in believers yet expects overcoming through the Spirit. The sacraments as means of grace are effectual not ex opere operato but as instruments by which the Spirit confirms and strengthens faith he himself creates.

What then is the defended position? Total depravity is the comprehensive corruption of human nature under **original sin** such that all acts of the unregenerate are defective in relation to God, even if materially virtuous. Total inability is the consequent moral impotence to turn to God apart from **effectual calling** and **regeneration**. Human freedom is **compatibilist**; we always choose according to our strongest loves. The gospel call is sincere to all, while God grants repentance and faith to the elect. **Common grace** preserves civil order and goods, but does not enable spiritual good. Christ’s atonement not only removes guilt but in Scripture is the ground for the Spirit’s gift of new life; union with Christ ensures that the grace that justifies also sanctifies. This position coheres with **federal theology**, preserves the gratuity of grace, fits the biblical depiction of human bondage, and yields pastoral realism and hope.

Finally, the doctrine’s fruit must be noted. It humbles the sinner and closes the mouth. It magnifies Christ and his cross as not a partial aid but a total rescue. It awakens a prayerful expectancy, since God alone saves, yet he saves through means. It equips pastors to deal honestly with sin’s depth and to preach grace that is truly amazing because it is truly efficacious. In an age enamored with autonomy yet beset by chains, the paradox crystallizes: we are not free until set free. **Total depravity** and **total inability** do not diminish human dignity; they diagnose our plight so that the grandeur of redemption in the triune God might be seen.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **total depravity** is pervasive corruption of all human faculties under **original sin**, and **total inability** is the moral impotence of the unregenerate to repent and believe apart from **effectual calling** and **regeneration**; freedom is **compatibilist**, not libertarian.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: anti-Pelagian grounding of **concupiscence**, bondage, and the need for **monergistic** grace under **federal headship**.

  - Calvin: integrates **total depravity** with **common grace** and internal-external call; affirms sincere offer and particular grace.
  - Arminius: **prevenient grace** restores ability and makes grace resistible; opposed at Dort.
  - Edwards: natural versus moral ability, **compatibilism**, new sense in regeneration; federal defense of imputation.
- Debates:
  - Internal: scope of **noetic effects**, civil righteousness and **common grace**, logical priority of **regeneration** to faith, the well-meant offer.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian synergism, Arminian resistible grace, Roman Catholic cooperation, libertarian free will.
  - Contemporary: neuroscience and agency, addiction and trauma, structural sin, implications for evangelism and pastoral care.
- Defended position: classic Reformed **monergism** where **total depravity** entails **total inability**, the Spirit’s **effectual calling** grants faith, and **common grace** permits civil good without spiritual good.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - If inability, why commands? Because commands reveal duty and drive to grace; God grants what he requires.
  - Does this deny the imago Dei? No, it ruins righteousness but retains natural powers and vocation.
  - How is God not author of sin? By **divine concurrence** and secondary causes; sin’s defect belongs to the creature.
  - Is federal imputation unjust? It mirrors justification in Christ and is the biblical mode of corporate representation.
  - How are freedom and responsibility preserved? By **compatibilism** and Edwards’s moral versus natural ability distinction.
