# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading Reformed theologian, articulated a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability** rooted in the federal headship of Adam and the pervasive effects of the Fall. He emphasized that every aspect of human nature is corrupted by sin, rendering humanity utterly incapable of turning to God apart from **sovereign grace**. Murray’s teaching upholds the necessity of **regeneration** as a divine act that alone overcomes human inability.

- "The doctrine of total depravity means not only that sin has affected every aspect of man’s being but also that man is utterly unable to recover himself or to respond to the overtures of the gospel apart from the efficacious grace of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity Extends to All Faculties**
    - Sin affects the mind, will, emotions, and body.
    - There is no part of human nature untouched by the Fall.
    - Depravity is not absolute, but it is pervasive and radical.
    - Even the moral and religious capacities are corrupted.
    - "There is no part of man’s nature that has escaped the taint of sin." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Total Inability to Respond to God**
    - Fallen humans cannot initiate or contribute to their own salvation.
    - The will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose spiritual good.
    - Inability is both moral and spiritual, not merely physical.
    - Only the work of the Holy Spirit can enable a saving response.
    - "Man is not only depraved but also impotent to remedy his condition." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Necessity of Regeneration**
    - Regeneration is a sovereign act of God, not a human achievement.
    - The new birth precedes and enables faith.
    - The Spirit’s work is effectual and irresistible in the elect.
    - Regeneration overcomes both depravity and inability.
    - "Regeneration is the act of God alone, effecting a radical change in the disposition of the soul." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Federal Headship and Original Sin**
    - Adam’s sin is imputed to all his descendants.
    - Human depravity is rooted in the covenantal relationship with Adam.
    - Original sin explains the universality and depth of human corruption.
    - This headship grounds the need for Christ’s representative obedience.
    - "The solidarity of the race with Adam is the basis of both condemnation and redemption." (The Epistle to the Romans)

5. **Grace is Absolutely Sovereign**
    - Salvation is initiated and completed by God’s sovereign will.
    - Grace is not merely an offer but an effectual power.
    - Human inability magnifies the necessity of divine intervention.
    - The doctrines of grace are inseparable from total depravity.
    - "It is only by sovereign grace that the bondage of the will is broken." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in the areas of soteriology and anthropology. His careful exegesis and systematic clarity have influenced generations of pastors, scholars, and confessional documents. By emphasizing the radical nature of sin and the necessity of sovereign grace, Murray reinforced the distinctives of the Reformed tradition and provided a compelling defense of the doctrines of grace in the modern era.
