# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—set forth a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability**. They teach that, due to the **Fall**, human nature is so corrupted that apart from **regenerating grace**, no one can turn to God or perform any spiritual good, underscoring the necessity of **sovereign grace** for salvation.

- "Therefore all people are conceived in sin and are born children of wrath, unfit for any saving good, inclined to evil, dead in their sins, and slaves to sin." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 14–16, 23
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 5, 8, 114
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Third and Fourth Main Points of Doctrine
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English edition)
- The Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Nature Is Radically Corrupted**
    - The **Fall** resulted in the pervasive corruption of every aspect of human nature.
    - All faculties—mind, will, and affections—are affected by **original sin**.
    - This corruption is inherited by all descendants of Adam.
    - Humanity is described as "dead in sin" and "slaves to sin."
    "Therefore all people are conceived in sin and are born children of wrath, unfit for any saving good, inclined to evil, dead in their sins, and slaves to sin." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

2. **Total Inability to Do Spiritual Good**
    - Fallen humans cannot, of themselves, will or do any true spiritual good.
    - Even the desire to repent or believe is beyond unaided human capacity.
    - The will is not merely weakened but is in bondage to sin.
    - Any movement toward God must originate from **God’s grace**, not human initiative.
    "Unless they are born again, by the Spirit of God, they are neither able nor willing to return to God." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.3)

3. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
    - **Regeneration** is essential for any saving response to the gospel.
    - The **Holy Spirit** alone can renew the heart and enable faith.
    - Grace is not merely a help but the decisive cause of spiritual life.
    - Regeneration precedes and enables faith and repentance.
    "Regeneration...is a supernatural work, most powerful, and at the same time most delightful, astonishing, mysterious, and ineffable." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.12)

4. **Salvation Is Entirely of God’s Initiative**
    - God’s **sovereign election** and effectual calling are necessary for salvation.
    - Human merit or effort plays no role in moving toward God.
    - Faith itself is a gift granted by God to the elect.
    - The glory for salvation belongs to God alone, not to human cooperation.
    "Faith is a gift of God, not because it is offered by God to man’s free will, but because it is actually conferred, instilled, and infused into him." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.14)

5. **Sin Remains Even in the Regenerate**
    - Even after regeneration, believers struggle with indwelling sin.
    - Complete freedom from sin is not attained in this life.
    - The ongoing need for grace and forgiveness is emphasized.
    - **Sanctification** is a continual process, not a one-time event.
    "Even the holiest men, while in this life, have only a small beginning of this obedience." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 114)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability** in the Reformed tradition, providing a confessional standard for Reformed churches worldwide. Their clear articulation of human inability and the necessity of **sovereign grace** has influenced later confessional documents and theological debates, especially in contrast to Arminian and semi-Pelagian views. These confessions continue to serve as a touchstone for discussions on the nature of sin, grace, and salvation in both academic and ecclesial contexts.
