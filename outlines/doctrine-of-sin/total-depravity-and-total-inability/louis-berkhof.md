# Louis Berkhof (1873–1957)

Louis Berkhof, a leading figure in Reformed theology, articulated a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability** within the framework of classic **Augustinian** and **Calvinistic** thought. He maintained that, as a result of the **Fall**, every aspect of human nature is corrupted, rendering humanity utterly incapable of turning to God apart from **sovereign grace**.

- "Man is totally depraved in the sense that corruption extends to every part of his nature, to all the faculties and powers of both soul and body." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Manual of Christian Doctrine (1933)
- The History of Christian Doctrines (1937)
- Summary of Christian Doctrine (1938)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Universal Corruption**
    - The Fall affected all of humanity, leaving no part of human nature untouched by sin.
    - **Original sin** is not merely a tendency but a pervasive corruption inherited from Adam.
    - Every faculty—mind, will, and emotions—is corrupted, not just external actions.
    - This depravity is both qualitative and extensive, affecting the whole person.
    - "Total depravity means that the unrenewed sinner is destitute of love for God, is guilty before Him, and is corrupt in every part of his being." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Total Inability to Do Spiritual Good**
    - Fallen humans are incapable of any act that is spiritually pleasing to God.
    - The will is in bondage to sin and cannot choose God apart from divine intervention.
    - Moral inability is distinguished from physical inability; the problem is not capacity but disposition.
    - Even the best human works are tainted by sin and lack true righteousness.
    - "Man cannot do any spiritual good that is pleasing in the sight of God, nor can he change his own evil disposition." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
    - Only the **Holy Spirit** can overcome human inability and bring about regeneration.
    - Regeneration is a monergistic act of God, not a cooperative process.
    - Faith and repentance are gifts, not autonomous human responses.
    - The initiative in salvation belongs entirely to God, not to the sinner.
    - "Regeneration is exclusively the work of God and precedes faith." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Distinction Between Common and Special Grace**
    - **Common grace** restrains sin but does not renew the heart or save.
    - Only **special (saving) grace** transforms the will and enables faith.
    - Common grace explains relative moral order but not spiritual good.
    - The distinction safeguards the necessity of sovereign grace for salvation.
    - "Common grace curbs the destructive power of sin, but only special grace removes the guilt and pollution of sin." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Rejection of Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian Views**
    - Berkhof firmly opposes any doctrine that affirms human ability to initiate salvation.
    - He critiques both **Pelagianism** and **Arminianism** for undermining the seriousness of the Fall.
    - Human cooperation in salvation is excluded; all boasting is eliminated.
    - The Reformed doctrine preserves the glory of God’s grace and the depth of human need.
    - "The Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views fail to do justice to the radical effects of sin on human nature." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkhof’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** has become a standard reference in Reformed systematic theology, shaping generations of pastors and theologians. His clear, concise exposition in Systematic Theology remains influential in seminaries and churches committed to the **Reformed tradition**. By emphasizing the utter dependence of sinners on divine grace, Berkhof reinforced the centrality of God’s sovereignty in salvation and provided a bulwark against anthropocentric soteriologies.
