# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically reinterpreted **total depravity** and **total inability** within his **Christocentric** framework, emphasizing the utter incapacity of humanity to know or choose God apart from divine revelation in **Jesus Christ**. For Barth, human sinfulness is not merely a moral defect but a profound existential estrangement from God, overcome only by the sovereign initiative of **grace**.

- "Sin is the impossible possibility which man realizes in his opposition to God." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Church Dogmatics II/1: The Doctrine of God
- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Karl Barth: A Theology of Word and Spirit (George Hunsinger)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Radical Estrangement**
    - Sin is defined as a fundamental alienation from God, not just a violation of law.
    - All human beings exist in a state of opposition to God’s will.
    - This estrangement is existential and ontological, not merely ethical.
    - Humanity’s condition is one of being “curved in on itself,” incapable of self-redemption.
    - "Sin is the revolt of man against God, his denial of the divine election and calling." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Total Inability Apart from Revelation**
    - Human beings cannot know or choose God by their own faculties.
    - Divine revelation in Jesus Christ is the only means by which God is known.
    - There is no natural theology or innate capacity for faith.
    - Faith itself is a gift, not a human achievement.
    - "God is known only by God, and only as He gives Himself to be known." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **Christ as the Only Overcomer of Depravity**
    - Jesus Christ is the sole mediator who overcomes human depravity.
    - In Christ, God acts decisively to reconcile humanity to Himself.
    - Human inability is met and overcome in the person and work of Christ.
    - Election and reconciliation are realized only in Him.
    - "In Jesus Christ, God has taken the place of the sinner." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Rejection of Autonomous Human Will**
    - Barth denies any autonomous human capacity to choose God.
    - Human will is bound and corrupted by sin.
    - Grace is not cooperative but monergistic—God acts alone.
    - Human response is always secondary to divine initiative.
    - "Man’s freedom is freedom in obedience, not in autonomy." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

5. **Sin as Both Individual and Corporate**
    - Sin affects both individuals and the whole of humanity.
    - There is a solidarity in sin, as all are implicated in Adam.
    - Redemption is likewise corporate, accomplished in Christ as the new Adam.
    - The church is the community of those called out of depravity by grace.
    - "In Adam all have sinned; in Christ all are made alive." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s reconfiguration of **total depravity** and **total inability** shifted the focus from inherited guilt to a Christ-centered understanding of human sinfulness and divine grace. His rejection of **natural theology** and insistence on revelation as the only ground for knowledge of God have profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology. Barth’s thought continues to shape discussions on the nature of sin, grace, and the limits of human freedom in relation to God.
