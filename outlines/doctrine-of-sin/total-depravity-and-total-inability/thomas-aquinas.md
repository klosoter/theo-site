# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas taught that **original sin** profoundly affects human nature, corrupting both intellect and will, but he did not affirm the Reformed doctrine of **total depravity** or **total inability** in the same sense. For Aquinas, fallen humanity is wounded and inclined toward evil, yet retains a residual capacity for natural good and rational action, though utterly unable to attain **supernatural righteousness** or salvation apart from **divine grace**.

- "Man, by his own natural powers, can do some particular good, as to build houses, plant vineyards, and the like; but he cannot do all good works appropriate to the state of grace, unless he be aided by God with habitual or sanctifying grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 109, a. 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 82–85, 109–114
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on Romans (Super Epistolam ad Romanos)
- De Malo (On Evil)
- Aquinas on Nature and Grace (ed. A. M. Fairweather)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin Corrupts Human Nature**
    - Original sin is transmitted from Adam, wounding human nature in all its faculties.
    - The loss of **original righteousness** leaves the will disordered and the intellect darkened.
    - Concupiscence remains as a consequence, inclining humans toward sin.
    - The image of God is diminished but not destroyed in fallen humanity.
    - "By original sin, the nature of man is corrupted, though not entirely destroyed." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 85, a. 1)

2. **Natural Powers Remain After the Fall**
    - Human beings retain the capacity for natural reason and civil virtue.
    - The will is weakened but not rendered absolutely powerless for all good.
    - Fallen humans can perform acts of natural good, though not meritorious for salvation.
    - The distinction between **natural** and **supernatural** good is central to Aquinas’s anthropology.
    - "Man, after sin, retains a free will, though it is weakened and inclined to evil." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 85, a. 2)

3. **Total Inability for Supernatural Good**
    - Without **grace**, humans cannot love God above all or perform acts meriting eternal life.
    - The initiative for salvation always comes from God’s **prevenient grace**.
    - Even the first movement toward God requires divine assistance.
    - Human cooperation with grace is real but always dependent on prior divine action.
    - "No one can begin to will or to do any good without God’s preventing and assisting grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 109, a. 6)

4. **Grace Heals and Elevates Nature**
    - **Sanctifying grace** restores the lost supernatural endowment and heals the wounds of sin.
    - Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it, enabling true righteousness.
    - The will is freed and empowered by grace to choose the good.
    - The process of healing is gradual, involving both justification and sanctification.
    - "Grace does not abolish nature, but perfects it." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 1, a. 8)

5. **Distinction Between Mortal and Venial Sin**
    - Not all post-Fall acts are equally depraved; some sins are more grievous than others.
    - Mortal sin entails a complete turning away from God, while venial sin does not.
    - Even in sin, the basic faculties of reason and will remain operative.
    - The gradation of sin reflects Aquinas’s nuanced understanding of human depravity.
    - "There are degrees of corruption in sin, for not all sin is mortal, nor does every sin destroy the good of nature." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 85, a. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s nuanced doctrine of **original sin** and grace profoundly shaped Roman Catholic anthropology and soteriology, distinguishing between the loss of supernatural righteousness and the retention of natural powers. His rejection of **total depravity** in the strict Augustinian or Reformed sense set a trajectory for later Catholic thought, emphasizing the integrity of human nature even after the Fall. Aquinas’s careful distinctions continue to inform ecumenical dialogues and remain foundational for understanding the Catholic position on human inability and the necessity of grace.
