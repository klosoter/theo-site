# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til articulated **total depravity** and **total inability** within a robustly **Reformed** and **presuppositional** framework. He insisted that fallen humanity is not merely inclined toward sin but is wholly unable to respond to God apart from **regenerating grace**, emphasizing the **antithesis** between the believer and unbeliever at the level of epistemology and ethics.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Radical Corruption**
    - Human nature is corrupted in every aspect—mind, will, and affections—by the Fall.
    - Sin is not superficial but affects the core of human personality and reasoning.
    - There is no neutral ground; all human faculties are in rebellion against God.
    - The image of God remains, but it is distorted and misused in service of autonomy.
    - "The heart of man is in principle always either covenant-keeping or covenant-breaking." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Total Inability and Spiritual Deadness**
    - Fallen humans are utterly unable to choose or do spiritual good apart from grace.
    - The will is not free but is enslaved to sin and self.
    - No one seeks God or understands Him rightly without the Spirit’s work.
    - Moral and intellectual inability are inseparable; both stem from spiritual death.
    - "Man’s ethical rebellion is also an epistemological rebellion." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Antithesis Between Believer and Unbeliever**
    - There is a fundamental opposition between the worldview of the regenerate and unregenerate.
    - The antithesis is rooted in the noetic effects of sin, affecting all reasoning.
    - Apologetics must recognize this antithesis and not appeal to supposed neutrality.
    - Only by regeneration can one move from darkness to light in thought and life.
    - "There is no common ground except that which the believer claims by virtue of God’s revelation." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
    - Only the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit can overcome total inability.
    - Regeneration precedes faith and repentance, enabling a true response to the gospel.
    - Grace is not merely assistance but a radical re-creation of the sinner.
    - Salvation is monergistic, rooted in God’s initiative alone.
    - "It is only the regenerated man who can truly know God and interpret reality rightly." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Presuppositional Apologetics and Depravity**
    - Apologetics must presuppose the truth of **Scripture** and the reality of total depravity.
    - Arguments must expose the unbeliever’s suppressed knowledge of God.
    - The apologist’s task is to challenge the autonomy of fallen reason.
    - Faith and reason are not independent; all reasoning is covenantal.
    - "All men know God, but they suppress the truth in unrighteousness." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and theology, especially through his doctrine of the **antithesis** and presuppositional method. His influence is evident in the work of later theologians and apologists such as Greg Bahnsen and John Frame. Van Til’s insistence on the radical effects of sin on all human faculties continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between faith, reason, and the necessity of grace.
