# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. affirms the **Reformed doctrine of total depravity**, emphasizing that sin’s corruption extends to every aspect of human nature, resulting in **total inability** to respond to God apart from sovereign grace. He grounds this view in **Pauline anthropology**, highlighting that only the **regenerating work of the Holy Spirit** can overcome humanity’s spiritual deadness.

- "The radicality of sin is such that only the radical grace of resurrection with Christ can avail." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Pervasive Corruption**
   - Every faculty of human nature—mind, will, and affections—is corrupted by sin.
   - Sin is not merely external acts but an inward, pervasive condition.
   - The image of God is marred, not erased, resulting in spiritual death.
   - Human beings are incapable of self-recovery or self-renewal.
   "Sin is not just a matter of isolated acts but a pervasive condition affecting the whole person." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Total Inability Without Regeneration**
   - Fallen humanity is utterly unable to turn to God or believe the gospel apart from divine initiative.
   - The will is in bondage to sin, rendering all unaided responses to God impossible.
   - Regeneration is a sovereign act of the Holy Spirit, not a cooperative process.
   - Faith itself is a gift, not a product of human effort.
   "Apart from the Spirit’s work, there is no capacity for saving faith." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Pauline Anthropology and the Flesh-Spirit Antithesis**
   - Paul’s distinction between "flesh" and "Spirit" underscores the depth of human depravity.
   - "Flesh" denotes the totality of fallen existence, not just physicality.
   - Only those "in Christ" are delivered from the dominion of the flesh.
   - The Spirit’s work is necessary to move from death to life.
   "The flesh-Spirit antithesis in Paul is absolute and admits of no neutral ground." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Union with Christ as the Remedy**
   - Deliverance from total depravity comes only through union with the resurrected Christ.
   - This union is effected by the Spirit and is the source of all spiritual life.
   - Justification and sanctification flow from this vital union.
   - The believer’s new identity is grounded in Christ’s resurrection power.
   "Union with Christ is the fountainhead of all soteriological blessings." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Necessity of Redemptive Revelation**
   - Human inability extends to the knowledge of God; natural revelation is insufficient for salvation.
   - The Spirit must illumine the mind and heart to receive the gospel.
   - Saving knowledge is a result of God’s self-disclosure in Christ and Scripture.
   - The epistemological effects of sin are overcome only by redemptive revelation.
   "The noetic effects of sin are such that only the Spirit’s illumination brings true knowledge of God." ("Some Epistemological Reflections on 1 Corinthians 2:6-16")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** has reinforced classic Reformed anthropology within contemporary theological scholarship, especially through his exegesis of Pauline texts. His emphasis on the necessity of the **Spirit’s regenerating work** and union with Christ has shaped the soteriological framework at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. Gaffin’s influence persists in debates on the nature of faith, regeneration, and the radical effects of sin, ensuring that the Reformed tradition’s understanding of human inability remains robust and biblically grounded.
