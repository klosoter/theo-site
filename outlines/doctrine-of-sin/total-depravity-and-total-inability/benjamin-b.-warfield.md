# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the pervasive corruption of human nature due to the **Fall**. He insisted that apart from the sovereign work of **divine grace**, fallen humanity is utterly incapable of turning to God or performing any spiritual good, thus necessitating **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit.

- "The inability under which man labors is not an inability to believe, but an inability to will to believe." (The Plan of Salvation)

## Key Works

- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Biblical Doctrine of Salvation"
- "The Theology of the Reformation"
- "Calvin and Calvinism"
- "Perfectionism" (especially in critique of alternative views of human nature)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Universal Corruption**
   - Human nature is thoroughly corrupted by **original sin**.
   - No part of human faculties—mind, will, or affections—remains untouched by sin.
   - This depravity is not merely moral weakness but radical corruption.
   - All people are equally subject to this condition, regardless of outward morality.
   - "The Scriptures represent all men as dead in trespasses and sins, and therefore unable to do any spiritual good." ("The Plan of Salvation")

2. **Total Inability to Respond to God**
   - Fallen humans cannot initiate or contribute to their own salvation.
   - The will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose God apart from grace.
   - Moral inability is rooted in the corruption of the heart, not in external coercion.
   - Faith itself is a gift, not a human achievement.
   - "It is not that man will not come to Christ, but that he cannot." ("The Plan of Salvation")

3. **Necessity of Regeneration by the Holy Spirit**
   - Only the **sovereign work of the Holy Spirit** can overcome human inability.
   - Regeneration precedes faith and is the cause of spiritual life.
   - The Spirit’s work is effectual, not merely persuasive.
   - Human cooperation is excluded from the initial act of regeneration.
   - "Regeneration is the creative act of the Holy Spirit, implanting a new principle of life." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Salvation")

4. **Sin’s Pervasiveness and the Need for Grace**
   - Sin affects every aspect of human existence, not just isolated acts.
   - Grace is not merely remedial but absolutely necessary for any spiritual good.
   - The doctrine underscores the radical nature of the gospel’s demand and provision.
   - Human merit is entirely excluded from the process of salvation.
   - "Grace does not supplement, but creates; it does not repair, but makes new." ("The Plan of Salvation")

5. **Rejection of Semi-Pelagian and Arminian Anthropology**
   - Warfield opposed any view that posits a residual ability in fallen humanity.
   - He critiqued systems that make grace merely assistive rather than efficacious.
   - The Reformed doctrine alone preserves the glory of God’s sovereign initiative.
   - Any compromise on inability undermines the necessity of Christ’s atonement and the Spirit’s work.
   - "The difference between Calvinism and all other systems is found just here: that all others make salvation depend on the work of man, while Calvinism throws man entirely on the work of God." ("Calvin and Calvinism")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** became a standard within twentieth-century Reformed theology, shaping both academic and pastoral understandings of human nature and salvation. His rigorous defense of these doctrines reinforced the necessity of **sovereign grace** and the exclusivity of divine initiative in salvation. Warfield’s influence persists in contemporary debates over **anthropology** and the nature of conversion, ensuring that his theological commitments remain central to confessional Reformed identity.
