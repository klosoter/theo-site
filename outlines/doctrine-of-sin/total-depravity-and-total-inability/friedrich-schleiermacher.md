# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the doctrines of **total depravity** and **total inability** through the lens of human **God-consciousness** and the universal condition of **sin** as alienation from God. Rather than emphasizing inherited guilt or a corrupted nature, Schleiermacher saw depravity as the disruption of the original **God-relation**, resulting in a universal incapacity to achieve true **faith** or **righteousness** apart from divine initiative.

- "Sin is simply the absence of God-consciousness in action, and this absence is universal." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Disruption of God-Consciousness**
    - Sin is fundamentally the loss or suppression of the original **God-consciousness**.
    - This disruption is universal and affects all human faculties.
    - Sin is not primarily a legal or forensic status but an existential condition.
    - The absence of God-consciousness leads to alienation from God and others.
    - "Every individual is in a state of sin simply by virtue of being part of the human race." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Inherited Guilt**
    - Schleiermacher denies the idea of transmitted guilt from Adam.
    - He views the solidarity of sin as a shared existential reality, not a legal imputation.
    - The universality of sin arises from the interconnectedness of human existence.
    - Each person participates in sin through their own acts and context.
    - "The doctrine of original sin is not about inherited guilt, but about the universality of the sinful condition." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Total Inability as Spiritual Powerlessness**
    - Humans are incapable of restoring the God-relation by their own efforts.
    - This inability is rooted in the disruption of God-consciousness, not in metaphysical corruption.
    - Only divine grace can reawaken true God-consciousness.
    - Human striving, apart from grace, cannot produce genuine faith or righteousness.
    - "The restoration of the God-consciousness is a work of divine grace alone." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Redefinition of Grace and Regeneration**
    - Grace is the divine action that reestablishes God-consciousness in the individual.
    - Regeneration is not a change of substance but a new orientation toward God.
    - The work of Christ is the historical and communal means by which grace is mediated.
    - The church is the sphere where the God-consciousness is nurtured and restored.
    - "Regeneration is the awakening of the God-consciousness through the influence of Christ." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Corporate Dimension of Sin and Redemption**
    - Sin and inability are not merely individual but have a communal dimension.
    - Humanity’s solidarity in sin is mirrored by the church’s solidarity in redemption.
    - The transformation of individuals is inseparable from the transformation of the community.
    - The work of Christ and the Spirit is directed toward the renewal of both persons and the human race.
    - "The new life in Christ is both personal and communal, overcoming the universal condition of sin." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **total depravity** and **total inability** shifted the focus from forensic categories to existential and relational ones, influencing modern **liberal theology** and the development of **religious experience** as a central theological category. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** and the communal nature of sin and redemption challenged traditional Reformed doctrines and paved the way for later existential and phenomenological approaches to sin. While controversial among confessional theologians, his legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of human inability and the meaning of grace.
