# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulated a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the pervasive effects of **original sin** on all aspects of human nature. He maintained that, apart from **regenerating grace**, fallen humanity is utterly incapable of turning to God or performing any truly good work, as the **image of God** in man has been radically corrupted by the Fall.

- "Sin is not a mere defect or limitation but a positive perversity of human nature, a corruption that penetrates to the very root of our being." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Radical Corruption**
    - Human nature is thoroughly corrupted by **original sin** in every faculty: mind, will, and affections.
    - This corruption is not merely partial but extends to the whole person, affecting all thoughts and actions.
    - The **image of God** remains, but it is deeply marred and distorted by sin.
    - Even the best human works are tainted by sinful motives apart from grace.
    - "Sin is a corruption that penetrates to the very root of our being." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

2. **Total Inability to Do Spiritual Good**
    - Fallen humanity is incapable of initiating or contributing to its own salvation.
    - The will is in bondage to sin and cannot choose God without divine intervention.
    - True faith and repentance are impossible apart from the work of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Human freedom remains, but it is enslaved to sinful desires.
    - "Man, having become enslaved to sin, is incapable of any saving good." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

3. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
    - Only **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit can overcome total inability.
    - Grace is not merely assistance but a radical re-creation of the heart.
    - Regeneration precedes faith and is the sole cause of spiritual renewal.
    - Salvation is entirely a work of **sovereign grace**, not human cooperation.
    - "Regeneration is a re-creation, a new birth, a work of God alone." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 4)

4. **Solidarity of the Human Race in Adam**
    - All humanity participates in Adam’s guilt and corruption through **federal headship**.
    - The consequences of the Fall are universal and inescapable apart from Christ.
    - Sin is both inherited and actual, affecting every person from conception.
    - The doctrine underscores the need for a **second Adam**—Christ—for redemption.
    - "In Adam, all have sinned and are subject to condemnation and death." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

5. **Common Grace and Restraint of Evil**
    - Despite total depravity, **common grace** restrains sin and enables civil good.
    - God’s providence prevents humanity from becoming as wicked as possible.
    - Civil righteousness and cultural achievements are possible, but not salvific.
    - Common grace serves to preserve the world and prepare for redemption.
    - "Common grace does not renew the heart, but it restrains the destructive power of sin." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** has profoundly shaped modern Reformed theology, providing a nuanced and comprehensive account of the effects of sin. His emphasis on the necessity of **regenerating grace** and the distinction between common and special grace continues to influence theological discussions on human nature and salvation. Bavinck’s synthesis of biblical exegesis, historical theology, and philosophical insight ensures his ongoing relevance in debates about the depth of human sinfulness and the sovereignty of divine grace.
