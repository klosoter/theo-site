# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **total depravity** asserts that all humans inherit a corrupted nature from Adam, rendering them incapable of turning to God apart from **divine grace**. He insists on **total inability**, teaching that the fallen will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose righteousness without the **regenerating work of the Holy Spirit**. Augustine’s views on human nature, sin, and grace profoundly shaped the Western understanding of **original sin** and the necessity of **sovereign grace**.

- "For it is by the law of sin that the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh." (On Nature and Grace)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Nature is Corrupted by Original Sin**
    - All humanity inherits a sinful nature from Adam.
    - This corruption affects every aspect of human faculties: mind, will, and affections.
    - Sin is not merely an act but a condition into which all are born.
    - The result is a universal bondage to sin.
    - "For in Adam, all die; and that which is born of flesh is flesh." (On Nature and Grace)

2. **Total Inability to Choose Good Apart from Grace**
    - Fallen humans cannot will or do any true good without God’s intervention.
    - The will is not free in spiritual matters but is enslaved to sin.
    - Even the desire to turn to God must be initiated by grace.
    - Human effort alone is insufficient for salvation.
    - "Without God’s grace, men can neither will nor do anything good." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

3. **Necessity of Prevenient and Sovereign Grace**
    - Grace must precede any movement toward God.
    - God’s grace is both necessary and effective in overcoming human inability.
    - Regeneration is a work of the Holy Spirit, not human cooperation.
    - Grace is not given in response to human merit.
    - "It is by God’s mercy alone that we are delivered, not by our own will." (Enchiridion)

4. **Bondage of the Will**
    - The will is not neutral but is bound to sin until liberated by grace.
    - True freedom is only possible through the transformation of the will.
    - The unregenerate cannot choose God or spiritual good.
    - The will’s bondage is both moral and spiritual.
    - "The will, therefore, is not free so long as it is subject to lusts and passions." (On Grace and Free Will)

5. **Salvation is Entirely of God**
    - Salvation is initiated, sustained, and completed by God alone.
    - Human boasting is excluded, as all good comes from God’s grace.
    - Faith itself is a gift, not a human achievement.
    - God’s election is based on His mercy, not foreseen merit.
    - "He who glories, let him glory in the Lord." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** became foundational for later Western theology, especially influencing **Reformed** and **Augustinian** traditions. His insistence on the necessity of **sovereign grace** shaped debates on free will, predestination, and salvation throughout church history. Both Protestant Reformers and medieval theologians drew heavily from Augustine’s insights, making his doctrine a central reference point in discussions of human sin and divine grace.
