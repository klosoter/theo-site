# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the doctrines of **total depravity** and **total inability** through the lens of existentialist interpretation and **demythologization**. He rejected traditional formulations of **original sin** and **inherited guilt**, instead emphasizing humanity’s universal alienation from God and the existential bondage of the will apart from authentic faith. For Bultmann, the biblical witness to human sinfulness is best understood as a description of the existential condition of being closed off from the possibility of true existence before God.

- "Sin is not a substance or a quality which can be inherited, but an existential determination of human existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Sin**
    - Interprets biblical language of **sin** and **depravity** existentially, not ontologically.
    - Rejects the idea of inherited **original sin** as a biological or metaphysical transmission.
    - Views mythic language as pointing to the universal human condition of alienation from God.
    - Seeks to translate ancient concepts into terms meaningful for modern existential understanding.
    - "The real meaning of the mythological doctrine of original sin is that man is always already a sinner." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Bondage of the Will**
    - Affirms that human beings are in a state of bondage, unable to achieve authentic existence on their own.
    - Interprets **total inability** as the incapacity to transcend self-centeredness without divine intervention.
    - Emphasizes that true freedom is only possible through encounter with the **kerygma**.
    - Human will is not free in the sense of autonomous self-determination before God.
    - "Man cannot liberate himself from his situation; he cannot of himself reach authentic existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Classical Doctrine of Original Sin**
    - Denies that sin is transmitted through natural generation or inherited guilt.
    - Argues that every person is existentially situated in sin from the outset.
    - Focuses on the existential reality of alienation rather than forensic categories.
    - Sees the doctrine as a mythological expression of a universal human predicament.
    - "The idea of inherited sin is a mythological way of expressing the fact that every man is a sinner." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Faith as the Only Possibility for Authentic Existence**
    - Only through faith in the **kerygma** does one move from inauthentic to authentic existence.
    - Faith is not assent to doctrine but an existential response to the call of God.
    - The human condition of **total inability** is overcome only by the event of faith.
    - Salvation is existential transformation, not merely legal or forensic change.
    - "Faith is the radical self-surrender to God’s word, which alone makes authentic existence possible." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Sin as Unbelief and Self-Centeredness**
    - Defines sin fundamentally as unbelief and self-assertion against God.
    - All human beings are characterized by this existential orientation apart from revelation.
    - The biblical witness to **total depravity** is interpreted as the universal tendency toward self-reliance.
    - Redemption is the breaking of this self-centeredness through the proclamation of Christ.
    - "Sin is the self-understanding of man as autonomous, as the master of his own existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential reinterpretation of **total depravity** and **total inability** profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the realms of **biblical hermeneutics** and existentialist thought. His approach challenged traditional Reformed and Lutheran categories, prompting both sharp criticism and creative engagement. While many theologians reject his demythologizing project, his insistence on the existential seriousness of the human predicament remains a significant contribution to twentieth-century theology. Bultmann’s work continues to shape discussions on the nature of sin, freedom, and the meaning of faith in the modern world.
