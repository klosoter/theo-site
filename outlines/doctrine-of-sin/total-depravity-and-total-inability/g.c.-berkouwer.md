# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **total depravity** and **total inability** with a nuanced Reformed perspective, emphasizing the pervasive effects of **sin** on human nature while also critiquing deterministic or mechanistic interpretations. He stressed that **human corruption** affects every aspect of existence, rendering people unable to turn to God apart from **divine grace**, yet he maintained the significance of human responsibility and the dynamic character of the **biblical witness**.

- "The inability of man is not a static incapacity, but is always related to the living God who addresses man in His Word." (Sin, p. 243)

## Key Works

- Sin (De zonde, English translation 1971)
- Faith and Justification
- Studies in Dogmatics (series)
- Man: The Image of God
- General Revelation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Radical Corruption**
    - Sin affects the whole person—mind, will, and affections.
    - No aspect of human life is untouched by the fall.
    - Depravity is not merely moral weakness but a fundamental alienation from God.
    - The doctrine is rooted in the biblical narrative, not abstract anthropology.
    - "Total depravity means that the whole man is involved in sin, but not that every man is as bad as he could possibly be." (Sin, p. 116)

2. **Total Inability and Divine Address**
    - Human inability is relational, not mechanical.
    - Inability is always in the context of God’s call and command.
    - The Word of God confronts and exposes human incapacity.
    - The dynamic between divine address and human response is central.
    - "Inability is not a metaphysical fate, but a refusal in the presence of God’s summons." (Sin, p. 243)

3. **Grace as the Only Source of Renewal**
    - Only **sovereign grace** can overcome human inability.
    - Regeneration is a work of the Holy Spirit, not human initiative.
    - Grace restores the possibility of true response to God.
    - The initiative in salvation always lies with God.
    - "Grace does not merely supplement human effort, but creates the possibility of faith." (Faith and Justification, p. 87)

4. **Human Responsibility Maintained**
    - Even in inability, humans remain responsible before God.
    - Responsibility is grounded in the ongoing address of God’s law and gospel.
    - Berkouwer rejects any doctrine that would excuse sin on the basis of inability.
    - The tension between inability and responsibility is a biblical paradox, not a logical contradiction.
    - "The seriousness of sin is not diminished by inability, but rather intensified." (Sin, p. 245)

5. **Critique of Determinism and Mechanistic Views**
    - Berkouwer warns against interpreting depravity as deterministic fatalism.
    - He insists on the personal and existential character of sin.
    - The Reformed doctrine must avoid reducing humans to passive objects.
    - The biblical witness calls for a dynamic, relational understanding.
    - "The doctrine of total inability must not be abstracted from the living relationship between God and man." (Sin, p. 244)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s treatment of **total depravity** and **total inability** has shaped modern Reformed theology by emphasizing the existential and relational dimensions of sin and grace. His careful exegesis and avoidance of deterministic extremes have influenced both academic and pastoral discussions. Berkouwer’s work continues to be a reference point for those seeking a biblically grounded yet nuanced articulation of human sinfulness and the necessity of **divine grace**.
