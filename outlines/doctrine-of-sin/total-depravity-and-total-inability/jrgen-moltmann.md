# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **total depravity** and **total inability** through the lens of **eschatological hope** and **Trinitarian theology**. Rather than emphasizing the utter incapacity of humanity to respond to God apart from grace, Moltmann focuses on the transformative potential of **God’s promise**, the solidarity of Christ with the suffering, and the Spirit’s renewing work in creation. He reframes human sinfulness not as absolute inability, but as the context for God’s redemptive action and the coming of the **Kingdom of God**.

- "God’s future opens up the closed horizon of the present and the past, and gives the despairing a reason to live and to hope." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Spirit of Life (1991)
- God in Creation (1985)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Broken Relationship, Not Absolute Inability**
    - Human sin is fundamentally a rupture in relationship with God, others, and creation.
    - Moltmann resists the notion that sin renders humanity utterly incapable of responding to God.
    - He emphasizes the ongoing presence of **imago Dei** even in fallen humanity.
    - Sin is tragic and pervasive, but not the final word in God’s economy.
    - "Sin is not just guilt, but the misery of separation from the living God." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Eschatological Hope Overcomes Despair**
    - The future promise of God redefines the present reality of sin and alienation.
    - Hope is grounded in the resurrection and the coming **Kingdom of God**.
    - Human incapacity is not ultimate; God’s future interrupts and transforms.
    - The Spirit’s work anticipates and enables new creation within history.
    - "Faith, wherever it develops into hope, causes not rest but unrest, not patience but impatience." (Theology of Hope)

3. **Christ’s Solidarity with the Suffering**
    - The cross is God’s identification with the godless and the lost.
    - In Christ, God enters into the depths of human estrangement and death.
    - Redemption is not only forensic but participatory and restorative.
    - The crucified God opens the possibility of reconciliation for all.
    - "In the cross of Christ, God is revealed as the God who suffers with us and for us." (The Crucified God)

4. **The Spirit’s Universal Renewal**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent of liberation and new creation.
    - The Spirit works within all creation, not just the church, to overcome alienation.
    - Human response to God is enabled and drawn forth by the Spirit’s presence.
    - Total inability is relativized by the Spirit’s universal activity.
    - "The Spirit is the power of life, the power of the resurrection, and the power of the new creation." (The Spirit of Life)

5. **Redemption as Participation, Not Merely Forensic**
    - Salvation is not only a legal declaration but a participatory transformation.
    - Humanity is invited into the life of the **Trinity** through Christ and the Spirit.
    - The church is a sign and instrument of God’s coming reign, not merely a collection of the elect.
    - The scope of redemption is cosmic, encompassing all creation.
    - "God’s future is the transformation of the world, not its abandonment." (God in Creation)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s reframing of **total depravity** and **total inability** has significantly influenced modern **systematic theology**, especially in ecumenical and liberationist circles. His emphasis on **eschatological hope** and the Spirit’s renewing work challenges classical Reformed pessimism about human nature, offering a vision of redemption that is participatory and cosmic in scope. While his views depart from traditional Calvinist formulations, they have inspired renewed engagement with the doctrines of sin, grace, and human agency in contemporary theology.
