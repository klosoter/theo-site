# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the pervasive corruption of human nature after the Fall. He maintained that all faculties of the soul are affected by **original sin**, rendering humans utterly incapable of turning to God or performing any truly good act apart from **regenerating grace**. Turretin’s careful distinctions clarified the extent and implications of human inability, setting the stage for later Reformed orthodoxy.

- "Man is so corrupt that he cannot even will to do good unless God first works in him to will and to do." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- The Doctrine of Original Sin (sections within Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem van Asselt, ed.)
- Francis Turretin: Theologian of the Protestant Reformation (secondary: James T. Dennison, Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity Extends to All Faculties**
    - The corruption of sin affects the intellect, will, and affections.
    - No part of human nature remains untouched by **original sin**.
    - Even the highest moral acts are tainted by sinful motives.
    - The image of God is marred, though not destroyed.
    - "The whole man, both in body and soul, is depraved and corrupted by sin." (Institutes)

2. **Total Inability to Do Spiritual Good**
    - Fallen humans cannot initiate or contribute to their own salvation.
    - The will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose God unaided.
    - External obedience is possible, but true spiritual good is not.
    - Only **effectual calling** and **regeneration** can overcome this inability.
    - "Free will is lost and man is dead in sins, unable to rise unless vivified by God." (Institutes)

3. **Distinction Between Natural and Moral Ability**
    - Humans retain natural faculties (reason, will) after the Fall.
    - Moral ability—the inclination and power to do good—is lost.
    - This distinction preserves human responsibility while affirming inability.
    - The law still binds, but sinners cannot fulfill it without grace.
    - "Man has not lost the faculty of willing, but the rectitude and liberty of the will." (Institutes)

4. **Necessity of Prevenient Grace**
    - Divine grace must precede any movement toward God.
    - Regeneration is a monergistic act of the Holy Spirit.
    - Grace is not merely assisting but effectually renewing the heart.
    - Faith and repentance are gifts, not autonomous human acts.
    - "Grace is not given to enable, but to effect the willing and the doing." (Institutes)

5. **Sin’s Universality and Imputation**
    - All humans inherit **Adam’s guilt** and corruption.
    - There is no exception to the universality of depravity.
    - Both imputed guilt and inherent corruption are emphasized.
    - The doctrine undergirds the necessity of **justification by faith alone**.
    - "All men sinned in Adam and are by nature children of wrath." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** became foundational for later Reformed confessional theology, influencing the Westminster Standards and subsequent scholastic theologians. His careful distinctions between natural and moral ability shaped debates on human freedom and responsibility. Turretin’s legacy endures in Reformed discussions of sin, grace, and salvation, providing a systematic framework for understanding the depth of human need and the necessity of sovereign grace.
