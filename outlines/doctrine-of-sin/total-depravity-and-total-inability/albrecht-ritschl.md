# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl rejected the traditional **doctrine of total depravity** and **total inability**, emphasizing instead the moral and religious capacity of humanity. He argued that sin is a matter of **wrong moral orientation** rather than an inherited or ontological corruption, and he denied that humans are utterly incapable of responding to God apart from supernatural grace. For Ritschl, the focus of theology is on the **ethical community** and the realization of the **Kingdom of God** rather than on metaphysical accounts of human nature.

- "The doctrine of original sin, as it is commonly understood, is not compatible with the moral responsibility which is the presupposition of all ethical religion." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- Justification and Reconciliation (Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung)
- The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation (English translation)
- Instruction in the Christian Religion (Unterricht in der christlichen Religion)
- Theology and Metaphysics (Theologie und Metaphysik)

    - Defines sin as a failure of moral purpose rather than a state of being.
    - Focuses on the will and ethical choices of individuals.
    - Rejects inherited guilt or metaphysical transmission of sin.
    - Sees the possibility of moral improvement through community and education.
    - "Sin is not a substance, but a direction of the will." (Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Human Capacity for God**
    - Affirms that all people retain the ability to respond to God’s call.
    - Denies the necessity of prevenient or irresistible grace for conversion.
    - Emphasizes the role of the **Kingdom of God** as a motivating ideal.

    - Views the church as the locus for moral development and reconciliation.
    - Downplays individualistic accounts of depravity and inability.
    - Sees the **Kingdom of God** as realized through communal ethical action.
    - "The Christian community is the sphere in which reconciliation is realized." (Justification and Reconciliation)

5. **Critique of Metaphysical Anthropology**
    - Rejects speculative doctrines about human nature’s essence.
    - Argues that theology should avoid metaphysical explanations of sin and grace.
    - Focuses on historical and practical realities over abstract categories.
    - Sees the **image of God** in humanity’s ethical vocation, not in ontological status.
    - "Theology must be freed from metaphysical presuppositions which obscure the ethical task." (Theology and Metaphysics)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s rejection of **total depravity** and **total inability** marked a significant shift in modern Protestant theology, influencing the development of **liberal theology** and the focus on ethical and communal aspects of Christian faith. His emphasis on the **Kingdom of God** and the moral capacity of humanity shaped later thinkers such as Adolf von Harnack and the Social Gospel movement. While criticized by confessional theologians for downplaying sin’s seriousness, Ritschl’s approach remains foundational for discussions of ethics, community, and the practical outworking of Christian doctrine.
