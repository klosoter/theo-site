# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the pervasive corruption of human nature after the Fall. He maintained that fallen humanity is utterly incapable of turning to God or doing any spiritual good apart from the sovereign work of **regenerating grace**. Vos’s biblical-theological approach rooted these doctrines in the unfolding history of **redemption** and the **covenant of grace**.

- "Sin is not merely a disease, but a radical perversion of the entire nature of man, affecting all his faculties." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology")

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Pauline Eschatology
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Love of God" (Princeton Theological Review)
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Radical Corruption**
   - Human nature is thoroughly corrupted by the Fall, affecting intellect, will, and affections.
   - Sin is not superficial but penetrates to the core of human existence.
   - Every aspect of human life is tainted by **original sin**.
   - There is no island of moral or spiritual soundness left in fallen man.
   - "The depravity is total in the sense that it affects every part of man’s being." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Total Inability to Respond to God**
   - Fallen humanity cannot initiate or contribute to its own salvation.
   - The will is in bondage to sin and cannot choose spiritual good.
   - Any movement toward God must originate from **divine grace**.
   - Human inability is both moral and spiritual, not merely physical or intellectual.
   - "Man is not only unwilling but unable to return to God apart from regenerating grace." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Necessity of Regeneration**
   - Regeneration is the sovereign act of the **Holy Spirit** imparting new life.
   - Only regeneration can overcome total inability and enable faith.
   - The new birth is monergistic, not synergistic.
   - Faith and repentance are fruits, not causes, of regeneration.
   - "Regeneration is the creative act of God, producing a new principle of life." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

4. **Biblical-Theological Foundation**
   - The doctrine is grounded in the narrative of **redemptive history**.
   - Vos traces depravity and inability from Adam through the covenants.
   - The Pauline epistles are central for articulating human inability.
   - The solution to depravity is found in the work of Christ as the Second Adam.
   - "The history of redemption presupposes the utter lostness of man in sin." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Covenantal Context of Depravity**
   - Total depravity is a result of the breach of the **covenant of works**.
   - The **covenant of grace** is God’s remedy for human inability.
   - Election and effectual calling are rooted in God’s covenantal faithfulness.
   - The church is the community of the regenerate, not merely the morally reformed.
   - "The covenant of grace is the divine answer to the total inability of fallen man." (The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially through his biblical-theological method. His influence is evident in later theologians who emphasize the redemptive-historical context of human sin and salvation. By rooting these doctrines in the drama of **covenant** and **redemption**, Vos provided a framework that continues to inform both academic and pastoral theology within the Reformed tradition.
