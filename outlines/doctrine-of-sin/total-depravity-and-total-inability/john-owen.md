# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen articulated a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability**, emphasizing the pervasive corruption of human nature after the Fall. He maintained that apart from the sovereign work of the **Holy Spirit** in **regeneration**, fallen humanity is utterly incapable of turning to God or performing any truly good act.

- "Man hath no power of himself to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto." (The Holy Spirit, Works, Vol. 3)

- The Mortification of Sin in Believers
- The Nature and Causes of Apostasy from the Gospel
- The Holy Spirit (Works, Vol. 3)
- A Display of Arminianism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Corruption of Human Nature**
   - Humanity is radically corrupted in every faculty—mind, will, and affections—by original sin.
   - This corruption extends to all people without exception.
   - The image of God is marred, leaving man spiritually dead.
   - Sin is not merely an act but a pervasive condition.
   - "The mind is darkened, the affections polluted, the will perverted, and the whole soul rendered utterly unable to discern or desire spiritual good." (The Holy Spirit)

2. **Total Inability to Do Spiritual Good**
   - Fallen humans cannot will or do anything truly pleasing to God.
   - The will is in bondage to sin and cannot choose God apart from grace.
   - Moral inability is rooted in the heart’s enmity toward God.
   - External law or exhortation cannot overcome this inability.
   - "Men have no power of themselves to think a good thought, nor to do any thing that is spiritually good." (A Display of Arminianism)

3. **Necessity of Regeneration**
   - Only the **Holy Spirit** can effectually renew the heart.
   - Regeneration is a sovereign, monergistic act of God.
   - Without regeneration, man remains dead in trespasses and sins.
   - The new birth enables faith and repentance.
   - "Regeneration is the putting of a new principle of spiritual life into the soul, whereby it is enabled to live unto God." (The Holy Spirit)

4. **Irresistible Grace**
   - The grace that overcomes depravity is effectual and cannot be resisted by the elect.
   - God’s inward call by the Spirit ensures the response of faith.
   - This grace is not given to all, but only to those chosen in Christ.
   - The Spirit’s work is both necessary and sufficient for salvation.
   - "The effectual grace of God doth not find men willing, but makes them so." (The Holy Spirit)

5. **Rejection of Pelagian and Arminian Views**
   - Owen strongly opposed any doctrine that ascribed to man the ability to cooperate with grace unaided.
   - He critiqued notions of prevenient grace that left the final decision to human will.
   - Human freedom is not lost, but is always exercised in bondage to sin apart from grace.
   - The glory of salvation belongs to God alone, not to human effort.
   - "To ascribe the least ability to man in himself to do any spiritual good is to derogate from the grace of God." (A Display of Arminianism)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** became foundational for later Reformed theology, especially in debates with Arminianism and other synergistic systems. His rigorous defense of the necessity of **regeneration** and the sovereignty of the **Holy Spirit** shaped Puritan spirituality and influenced subsequent confessional standards. Owen’s work remains a touchstone for discussions of human nature, sin, and grace within the Reformed tradition.
