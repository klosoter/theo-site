# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, articulated a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability** grounded in classic **Reformed anthropology**. He maintained that the fall left humanity wholly corrupt in nature and utterly incapable of turning to God apart from **sovereign grace**, emphasizing the necessity of **regeneration** for any spiritual good.

- "The inability of fallen man is not physical, but moral; it arises from the corruption of his nature." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Universal Corruption**
    - All aspects of human nature are affected by the fall.
    - No part of the person—mind, will, or affections—remains untainted by sin.
    - Depravity is not merely outward but rooted in the heart.
    - Every action, apart from grace, is displeasing to God.
    - "Every man, in virtue of his descent from Adam, is born destitute of original righteousness, and with a corrupt nature." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Total Inability to Do Spiritual Good**
    - Fallen humans cannot initiate or contribute to their own salvation.
    - The will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose God unaided.
    - Inability is moral, not natural; humans retain faculties but lack righteous inclination.
    - Any movement toward God is the result of divine intervention.
    - "The Scriptures teach that men, in their natural state, are utterly unable to do anything spiritually good." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Necessity of Regeneration by the Holy Spirit**
    - Regeneration is a sovereign act of God, not a human achievement.
    - The Spirit imparts new life, enabling faith and repentance.
    - Without regeneration, the sinner remains spiritually dead.
    - The new birth precedes and enables any response to the gospel.
    - "Regeneration, therefore, is the act of God by which the principle of spiritual life is implanted in man." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Sin as Both Guilt and Pollution**
    - Original sin involves both the imputation of Adam’s guilt and the inheritance of a corrupt nature.
    - Guilt renders humanity liable to condemnation.
    - Pollution ensures that all are born with a propensity toward evil.
    - Both aspects necessitate redemption through Christ.
    - "Original sin, therefore, as the Reformed churches maintain, includes both guilt and pollution." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Grace as the Only Remedy**
    - Salvation is entirely of grace, excluding all human merit.
    - Divine grace alone overcomes human inability.
    - The application of redemption is monergistic, not synergistic.
    - Faith itself is a gift, not a human work.
    - "If salvation is of grace, it must be of God; for man, in his fallen state, can do nothing to save himself." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** became foundational for American Presbyterianism and the broader **Reformed tradition**. His careful distinction between moral and natural inability influenced generations of theologians and pastors. Hodge’s legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of the necessity of **sovereign grace** for salvation and the utter dependence of sinners on divine initiative. His work remains a touchstone for discussions of human nature and the doctrine of sin in Reformed theology.
