# Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758)

Jonathan Edwards articulated a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability**, emphasizing the pervasive corruption of human nature after the Fall. He argued that apart from **regenerating grace**, fallen humanity is utterly incapable of turning to God, as the will is enslaved to sin and lacks any true spiritual good.

- "Men are not only dead in sin, but they are also utterly unable to help themselves out of this state." ("The Freedom of the Will")

## Key Works

- "The Freedom of the Will"
- "Original Sin"
- "A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections"
- "Sermons: Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"
- George M. Marsden, "Jonathan Edwards: A Life"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity as Universal Corruption**
    - All humans inherit a sinful nature from Adam, affecting every faculty.
    - There is no part of human life untouched by sin, including the intellect, will, and affections.
    - Sin is not merely external acts but a deep-seated disposition against God.
    - This depravity renders all natural actions displeasing to God.
    - "The depravity of man’s nature appears in its full extent, in that it is against God himself." ("Original Sin")

2. **Total Inability to Choose Spiritual Good**
    - Fallen humans cannot will or desire true spiritual good without divine intervention.
    - The will is determined by the strongest motive, which, in the unregenerate, is always sin.
    - There is no neutral or autonomous freedom in the fallen state.
    - Conversion requires a supernatural change wrought by the Holy Spirit.
    - "Men have no ability to will or do anything truly good, till they are made new creatures." ("The Freedom of the Will")

3. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
    - Only **regeneration** can overcome total inability.
    - The Spirit imparts a new principle of life, enabling faith and repentance.
    - Grace is both necessary and effectual for salvation.
    - Human cooperation is excluded in the initial act of regeneration.
    - "God’s grace is absolutely necessary to bring men to Christ." ("The Freedom of the Will")

4. **Moral, Not Natural, Inability**
    - Edwards distinguishes between natural ability (capacity) and moral inability (corruption of will).
    - Humans retain faculties but are morally unable to use them rightly.
    - Moral inability consists in the heart’s aversion to God, not a lack of faculties.
    - This distinction upholds human responsibility despite inability.
    - "The inability consists in the will itself, and not in the faculties of understanding or body." ("The Freedom of the Will")

5. **Original Sin as the Root of Depravity**
    - Adam’s first sin is imputed to all his descendants.
    - All are born with a corrupt nature due to federal headship.
    - Original sin explains the universality and depth of human depravity.
    - This doctrine safeguards the necessity of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - "All mankind are by nature in a state of total ruin, both with respect to the guilt of sin and the corruption of nature." ("Original Sin")

## Legacy and Impact

Edwards’ articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition in America, reinforcing the necessity of **sovereign grace** in salvation. His careful distinction between moral and natural inability influenced later Calvinist theology and debates on human freedom. Edwards remains a central figure in discussions of original sin, the will, and the nature of conversion, with his insights continuing to inform both academic and pastoral theology.
