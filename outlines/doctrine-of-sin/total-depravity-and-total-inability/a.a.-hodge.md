# A.A. Hodge (1823–1886)

A.A. Hodge, as a leading Reformed theologian, strongly affirmed the doctrines of **total depravity** and **total inability** as essential aspects of the human condition after the Fall. He taught that every aspect of human nature is corrupted by **original sin**, rendering people utterly unable to turn to God or do any spiritual good apart from **regenerating grace**. Hodge’s articulation of these doctrines is rooted in classic **Calvinistic anthropology** and is foundational to his understanding of **salvation**.

- "The inability of man is not physical, but moral; it consists in the want of inclination, and not in the want of faculties." (Outlines of Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity Affects All of Human Nature**
    - Human beings are corrupted in every faculty—mind, will, and affections—by **original sin**.
    - No part of human nature remains untouched by the Fall.
    - This depravity is not absolute, but universal and radical.
    - The image of God is marred, not destroyed, in fallen humanity.
    - "Every faculty of man’s nature is disordered, and the whole man is alienated from God." (Outlines of Theology)

2. **Total Inability to Do Spiritual Good**
    - Fallen humans are incapable of choosing or doing anything truly pleasing to God.
    - This inability is moral, not natural; faculties remain, but the will is enslaved to sin.
    - Conversion or faith is impossible without **divine intervention**.
    - The sinner’s inability is both real and culpable.
    - "Man’s inability consists in his inveterate indisposition and aversion to all spiritual good." (Outlines of Theology)

3. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
    - Only the **Holy Spirit** can overcome human inability and bring about new birth.
    - Regeneration is a sovereign act of God, not a cooperative process.
    - Faith and repentance are fruits, not causes, of regeneration.
    - Grace is both necessary and effectual for salvation.
    - "Regeneration is the act of God alone, producing a radical change in the moral nature of the soul." (Outlines of Theology)

4. **Sin and Responsibility**
    - Human responsibility is maintained despite total inability.
    - The moral law continues to bind all people, even those unable to obey.
    - Inability does not excuse sin, since it arises from a corrupt will.
    - The justice of God is upheld in holding sinners accountable.
    - "The inability of man is no excuse for his sin, since it is his own fault." (The Confession of Faith)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Depravity and Inability**
    - Hodge grounds his doctrine in key biblical texts (e.g., Romans 3, Ephesians 2).
    - He appeals to the **Westminster Confession** as a faithful summary of Scripture.
    - The universality of sin and inability is a revealed, not speculative, truth.
    - The doctrine is essential for a proper understanding of the **gospel**.
    - "The Scriptures everywhere teach that man is dead in trespasses and sins, and that salvation is wholly of grace." (Outlines of Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

A.A. Hodge’s robust defense of **total depravity** and **total inability** shaped the articulation of Reformed soteriology in the late nineteenth century, especially within American Presbyterianism. His clear exposition of these doctrines in relation to the **Westminster Standards** influenced generations of pastors, theologians, and confessional churches. Hodge’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a classically Reformed understanding of human sinfulness and the necessity of sovereign grace.
