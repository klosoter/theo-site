# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **total depravity** and **total inability**, affirming that all humans are fallen in **Adam** and thus wholly unable to turn to God apart from **sovereign grace**. This depravity extends to every aspect of human nature, rendering people incapable of any spiritual good or self-renewal without the regenerating work of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation." (Westminster Confession of Faith 9.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- Westminster Larger Catechism
- Westminster Shorter Catechism
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Comprehensive Corruption of Human Nature**
    - All faculties—mind, will, affections—are corrupted by the Fall.
    - No part of human nature remains untouched by sin.
    - This corruption is inherited from Adam by ordinary generation.
    - Even the best human works are tainted and unacceptable before God.
    - "From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil, do proceed all actual transgressions." (WCF 6.4)

2. **Inability to Do Spiritual Good**
    - Fallen humans cannot will or do anything truly pleasing to God.
    - The will is not merely weakened but enslaved to sin.
    - No one can prepare themselves for conversion by their own efforts.
    - Any movement toward God requires divine initiative.
    - "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation." (WCF 9.3)

3. **Necessity of Regeneration**
    - Regeneration is a sovereign act of the Holy Spirit.
    - Only regeneration enables a person to respond to the gospel.
    - The new birth imparts a new principle of spiritual life.
    - Faith and repentance are gifts granted in regeneration.
    - "This effectual call is of God’s free and special grace alone, not from anything at all foreseen in man." (WCF 10.2)

4. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the representative of all humanity.
    - His first sin is imputed to all his descendants.
    - All are born guilty and corrupt as a result.
    - This headship grounds the universality of depravity and inability.
    - "They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed; and the same death in sin and corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity." (WCF 6.3)

5. **Distinction Between Natural and Spiritual Ability**
    - Humans retain natural faculties (reason, will) after the Fall.
    - Spiritual ability—the capacity to will or do good toward salvation—is lost.
    - The distinction guards against fatalism and affirms human responsibility.
    - Only grace restores spiritual ability, not natural endowments.
    - "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation." (WCF 9.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on human sinfulness and the necessity of grace. Their articulation of **total depravity** and **total inability** remains foundational for Presbyterian and confessional Reformed churches worldwide. By grounding these doctrines in Scripture and covenant theology, the Standards continue to inform debates on human freedom, responsibility, and the nature of salvation. Their influence endures in catechesis, preaching, and theological education.
