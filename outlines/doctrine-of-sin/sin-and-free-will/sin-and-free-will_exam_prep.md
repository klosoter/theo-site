### ESSAY
To speak rigorously of sin and free will we must define both in relation to God. Sin is not a rival substance but a privative distortion of created good, lawlessness that lacks the rectitude due to God and neighbor. It is also culpable, a violation of divine law by agents whose wills are their own. Free will, in turn, names the rational appetite’s capacity to act from itself according to reasons and ends. The crucial question is not whether humans choose, but whether their choosing is self-moved in a way that secures responsibility without denying divine rule. The Augustinian–Reformed answer is that the will is free in its mode of operation, yet morally bound by its nature. Freedom as spontaneity is preserved, while the power to choose the good simpliciter is lost in Adam until restored by grace. This yields the fourfold estate of man: able to sin and able not to sin in innocence, not able not to sin in the fall, able not to sin under grace, and not able to sin in glory. This schema underwrites a robust doctrine of **original sin** and a compatibilist account of responsibility within **providence**.

Augustine (354–430) framed the debate by relocating its center from autonomous capacity to ordered love. Against Pelagius, he argued that Adam’s sin vitiated human nature, so that apart from grace men are non posse non peccare. In works such as De libero arbitrio and Anti-Pelagian writings, Augustine distinguishes liberum arbitrium, the faculty of choice, from libertas, the freedom to delight in God. The first remains after the fall; the second is lost. Sin is an aversio from God and conversio to the creature, a disordered love that turns the will’s spontaneity against its own beatitude. Thus culpability arises not from indeterminist power to do otherwise, but from the fact that the act proceeds from the person’s own will. Grace, as Augustine insists, is not mere aid but effective healing and delight. God’s predestination secures that some are given persevering love, while others are justly passed over, without God being the author of their sin. Augustine’s metaphysics of **divine simplicity** and **immutability** supports this asymmetry: God as the one simple good is the cause of every perfection and act of being, but sin as privation has no efficient cause as such. God’s will can permit and govern evil by ordaining good ends through the created **secondary causality** of disordered agents. Under pressure, Augustine refuses the premise that responsibility requires a will indifferent to reasons; responsibility requires that the willing be of the agent and for the reasons the agent embraces. Augustine thereby introduces the field’s decisive conceptual moves: disordered love as the heart of sin, the bondage of the will’s delight, and efficacious grace that liberates.

Pelagius (c. 360–418) stands as the antitype. He read law and gospel as commands implying ability and held that each soul is created as Adam was, morally neutral and capable of avoiding sin by resolve. Grace for Pelagius is primarily external instruction and example, not decisive inward transformation. This preserves a libertarian picture of moral agency but at the expense of both Scripture’s diagnosis of man dead in sin and the church’s practice of prayer for effectual mercy. Pelagius forces a false dilemma: either moral responsibility or profound corruption. Augustine’s response is that moral responsibility rests on the will acting from itself in accord with its own loves, not on a metaphysical feature of indifference. The church codified Augustine’s position and condemned Pelagianism. For examiners, the key is to see how Augustine avoids making sin a positive entity willed by God. He distinguishes God’s willing the good of the order of nature and his permissive willing of the defect in the order of sin, the defect being wholly located in the created agent’s failure. The doctrine of **primary and secondary causality** secures this: God concurs with the act as act, but not with its privative defect.

After Augustine, Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) provided a metaphysical precision that remains indispensable. Aquinas’s faculty psychology locates freedom in the rational appetite’s relation to the universal good. The will is moved by the intellect’s presentation of ends and by the object’s goodness, yet as an intellectual appetite it can deliberate among means to the end, acting for reasons. Aquinas defines sin as a privation of due order, rooted in disordered passion and a failure of practical reason, and he teaches that original sin is a privation of original justice that disorders the lower powers. Crucially, Aquinas articulates **secondary causality** and divine concurrence in a way that guards both divine sovereignty and creaturely integrity. God as first cause moves the will infallibly toward its act without violating its mode as an intellectual appetite. Doing so, he distinguishes necessity of coercion from necessity of the end, and he rejects any view in which God’s motion imposes external compulsion. The will moves itself by reason under God’s universal causality. Aquinas thus anticipates the Reformed insight that necessity need not entail compulsion. At the same time, his Roman Catholic heirs will later contest whether concupiscence in the regenerate is properly sin; Aquinas calls concupiscence a fomes of sin but not sin itself unless consented to. This differs from the Reformed insistence that the law requires perfect conformity and that concupiscence is truly contrary to the law and therefore sin.

Martin Luther (1483–1546) radicalized Augustine’s insight in The Bondage of the Will against Erasmus. Luther’s polemical point is simple: the will is not a neutral arbiter between God and sin; it is curved in on itself. Therefore any talk of free will in the unregenerate is a theological fiction. Yet Luther maintains necessity without compulsion. Sinning is necessary in the sense that given the will’s corruption, it cannot do otherwise; but the sinner wills his sin spontaneously. Luther reframes responsibility as answerability before God, not as possession of alternative possibilities. Human captivity under sin is compatible with culpability because the will is captive to what it loves. The law exposes this captivity and drives to Christ; the gospel regenerates, giving the Spirit who creates new affections. Here the Reformation emphasis on monergistic grace meets the anthropology of disordered love. Luther’s sharp account risks a collapse of nature into sin unless balanced by a doctrine of creation’s goodness and the continuing integrity of the faculties. Calvin will provide that balance by drawing on **federal theology** and the order of **providence**.

John Calvin (1509–1564) integrates Augustinian anthropology with a strong doctrine of providence and covenant. In Calvin, Adam is a real head of humanity whose violation of the probationary covenant entails both the imputation of guilt and the propagation of corruption. Calvin is not formal federalist in later scholastic terms, yet he treats Adam as the public person of the race. That yields a twofold **original sin** that is not merely imitation. On freedom, Calvin is explicit: the will is not forced but is bound to the evil by its corruption. He distinguishes compulsion from necessity and places human choices under God’s exhaustive governance without erasing their genuineness. God does not author sin because the moral pravity is the creature’s. The distinction between God’s secret will and revealed will functions not to evade difficulties but to affirm that God ordains even evil events for holy ends while commanding righteousness from his creatures. Calvin’s robust doctrine of **secondary causality** secures real means and genuine responsibility. Against the charge that this makes exhortation and prayer meaningless, Calvin insists that God ordains not only the end but the means, including preaching and repentance. He adds an ecclesial and sacramental realism that binds the liberated will to the means of grace. On concupiscence Calvin departs clearly from Roman accounts: even in the regenerate concupiscence is properly sin because it is contrary to the law’s demand for perfect love, though it does not reign.

Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758) supplies analytic clarity that meets many modern objections. In Freedom of the Will, Edwards defines the will as that by which the mind chooses, and freedom as the ability to do as one wills without external hindrance. He distinguishes **natural ability** from **moral inability**. Natural ability is the possession of requisite faculties; moral inability is the absence of inclination to the good due to the state of the heart. The sinner is thus unable to come to Christ because he will not; his will is determined by his strongest motive, which is a function of his disposition. This introduces the idea of moral necessity, which is not compulsion. Edwards anticipates Frankfurt-style intuitions: responsibility does not require access to alternative possibilities but sourcehood in the agent’s own motives. He proposes that volitions have causes in prior states of the soul and that a self-determining power would merely relocate the regress without improving responsibility. In Original Sin, Edwards defends **federal headship** and the unity of the human race, arguing from the uniform depravity of all and the social unity of mankind. He treats Adam’s sin as truly imputed and our corruption as a just judicial consequence, refusing both Pelagian denial and bare realism. Against the charge that this is unjust, Edwards replies that representation is a universal principle in human society and that the divine constitution is righteous. In The End for Which God Created the World, he secures that God’s ultimate end is his own glory, and that the permission of sin magnifies the excellencies of grace and justice without God’s willing sin as sin.

These six figures frame the internal, external, and contemporary debates. Internally, the Reformed tradition articulates **compatibilist freedom** under divine decree and addresses three flash points. First, imputation: some, like Edwards and Reformed scholastics, defend immediate imputation of Adam’s guilt on the ground of **federal theology**, while others propose mediate imputation through inherited corruption. The dominant confessional stance sides with immediate imputation while acknowledging the inseparability of guilt and corruption. Second, the nature of concupiscence: the Reformed churches assert that concupiscence in the regenerate remains sin because it is contrary to God’s law, though it no longer reigns. This contrasts with Roman accounts that speak of concupiscence as a tinder for sin without guilt unless consented to. The Reformed position safeguards the radicality of sanctification as mortification of inward vices and the perpetual need for Christ’s righteousness. Third, decree and sin: Westminster theology insists that God ordains whatsoever comes to pass by one simple, eternal decree while being neither author nor approver of sin. Here the Augustinian and Thomist grammar of **secondary causality**, concurrence, and permission is non-negotiable. God is the cause of the act as act, the creature is the deficient cause of the defect. The divine intention is holy and good; the creature’s intention may be evil. Examiners will ask whether this reduces to a verbal distinction. The answer is that the real distinction between act and defect, and between kinds of causality, is metaphysical, not merely semantic.

Externally, three rival frameworks contest this picture. First, Pelagian and semi-Pelagian approaches affirm a libertarian power of contrary choice as essential to responsibility and dilute the necessity of regenerating grace. This weakens **original sin** and inevitably treats grace as a cooperative aid. The Augustinian–Reformed retort is double: Scripture’s diagnosis of moral death requires more than aid, and moral responsibility does not require indeterminist freedom but ownership of action under reasons. Second, Roman Catholic Thomism and Molinism offer divergent accounts of divine motion and freedom. Classical Thomism posits physical premotion by which God moves the will infallibly to act according to its nature; Molinism posits middle knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom, securing indeterminist choices under divine foreknowledge. Reformed theology stands nearer to Thomism in embracing **secondary causality** and denies the metaphysical independence that Molinism attributes to libertarian choices. Yet the Reformed sharpen Thomist claims by insisting on efficacious grace and by treating concupiscence as formally sinful. The examiner will press whether the Reformed are committed to a hard determinism. The answer is no, because the will’s mode is preserved and indeterminism is not necessary for responsibility. The distinction between necessity of consequence and necessity of coaction is central. Third, Arminian and modern analytic libertarianisms argue from the intuition that one cannot be blameworthy if one could not do otherwise. Edwards’s analysis, reinforced by Frankfurt and reasons-responsiveness theories, shows this intuition is mistaken. A person can be responsible if his act expresses his deep self and reasons in a stable way, even if alternative possibilities are not accessible.

Contemporary challenges intensify the need for conceptual clarity. Neuroscience often claims that brain states determine behavior in ways that erode responsibility. The Augustinian–Reformed view responds with a layered account of causation. Neural mechanisms are the proximate implementations of reasons and dispositions; they do not replace the agent-level explanation. Moral evaluation tracks the reasons-responsiveness of the person, not the microphysical substrate. However, pathologies that significantly impair reasons-responsiveness mitigate responsibility, which the tradition has long recognized in discussions of ignorance, habit, and compulsion. Addiction is a salient example. Aquinas’s habitus language and the Reformed account of indwelling sin supply conceptual tools to affirm both bondage and culpability, with degrees. Second, critics argue that structural or social sin complicates individual guilt. Augustinianism agrees that sin has corporate dynamics grounded in **federal headship** and social habituation. Yet it maintains that social structures do not absolve personal responsibility; rather they bear witness to how disordered loves propagate through institutions. The antidote is not the denial of guilt but deeper repentance that includes structural reform under **providence**. Third, evolutionary psychology is invoked to deny original sin, explaining pervasive selfishness as adaptive. But theological **federal theology** does not compete with biological mechanism. It interprets that mechanism under a covenantal history in which Adam’s disobedience judicially altered the moral condition of the race. Empirical uniformity of vice confirms rather than refutes the doctrine. Finally, contemporary analytic debates about free will often adopt a narrow principle that ought implies can, construed as access to alternative possibilities. Augustine, Calvin, and Edwards all reject that principle in the moral sense. Ought implies can in the natural sense; we are obligated to trust Christ because we have the faculties to hear, reason, and will; but our **moral inability** lies in corrupt loves. The divine command exposes and condemns that inability and directs us to Christ who grants new heart and new freedom.

The objection that compatibilism makes God the author of sin must be addressed decisively. The Augustinian–Reformed answer is triadic. First, metaphysical: as simple and immutable, God is the act of being, cause of all perfections. Sin as privation has no efficient cause in God. Second, moral: God intends goods through evils, never evil as evil. His intentions are holy and wise, whereas the creature’s intentions are defective. Third, causal: God’s concursus with the act does not entail concursus with the defect. The formal sinfulness of an act is located in the deviation from rule, not in the bare occurrence of the act. Genesis teaches that Joseph’s brothers meant evil; God meant good. The same event has diverse intentionality. If pressed that this partitions the act illegitimately, we reply that the metaphysical distinction between act and defect is real and mirrors our ordinary moral judgments, where we distinguish the physical movement from its moral specification. The Reformed doctrine of **secondary causality** is not an ad hoc escape; it is the only way to preserve both **divine simplicity** and creaturely integrity.

A second examiner challenge is pastoral: does this doctrine undermine evangelistic urgency or sanctification since God determines outcomes. The response is that in Scripture God ordains both ends and means. Preaching, prayer, and sacraments are enjoined precisely because they are the ordained means of effectual calling and growth. Moreover, the doctrine of **effectual calling** and **regeneration** is the engine of sanctification, not its enemy. It creates new freedom toward God, the **compatibilist freedom** of the regenerate who now act from a new heart. The old man remains, which is why concupiscence still acts, but no longer reigns. Union with Christ supplies both the forensic and the renovative dimensions: our guilt is imputed to Christ and his righteousness to us; our corruption is mortified by the Spirit. The regenerate can truly will the good though imperfectly; their freedom is freedom-of-excellence increasing by habitus in grace, consonant with Aquinas’s virtues and the Reformed doctrine of perseverance.

A final set of objections concerns justice in **federal headship**. How can guilt be imputed from Adam? The answer appeals to two lines. First, biblical covenantalism makes headship a normative mode of human existence. We naturally exist under representatives who act for us in families, churches, and states. Representation is not alien to justice. Second, Adam was constituted as public person for the race by God’s righteous appointment. If the arrangement seems severe, consider that in the second Adam we receive an overabundant righteousness not our own. The symmetry clarifies the justice: if we reject imputation in Adam, we cut the nerve of imputation in Christ. Edwards’s sociological and metaphysical considerations strengthen the case: humanity is one society with a moral union sufficient for representation. Contemporary individualism that denies such union is itself a moral error. This connects immediately to soteriology: apart from **federal theology**, union with Christ as the basis of justification and sanctification loses its covenantal depth.

Pulling threads together, the doctrine of sin and free will must integrate anthropology, providence, and redemption. Anthropology names the structure of the soul, the wounds of the fall, and the reality of **moral inability**. Providence names God’s universal governance by **primary and secondary causality** and the wisdom that permits evil for greater good. Redemption names grace that is both forensic and renovative, freeing the will to delight in God. Augustine clears the ground by re-centering freedom on love and grace. Aquinas gives metaphysical grammar that secures God’s causality and creaturely integrity. Luther and Calvin bind the diagnosis of bondage to the life of the church under the Word and sacraments, and they protect the truth that concupiscence remains sin. Edwards offers analytic precision crucial in contemporary debate, distinguishing **natural ability** and **moral inability** and tying responsibility to sourcehood rather than access to alternatives. Pelagius remains the foil whose attractive simplicity is finally unfaithful to the gravity of sin and the glory of grace.

Therefore I defend an Augustinian–Reformed compatibilism. The fallen will is free as to spontaneity but enslaved as to righteousness. **Original sin** is both imputed guilt under Adamic **federal headship** and inherent corruption that inclines to evil. God ordains whatsoever comes to pass by **primary and secondary causality** while willing no evil as evil and remaining free from taint. Moral responsibility does not require alternative possibilities but requires that acts flow from the agent’s own reasons and loves. Grace is efficacious, renewing the will in regeneration so that true liberty begins. In sanctification, God cultivates habits of holiness that increase freedom-of-excellence; in glory, he perfects libertas as non posse peccare. This doctrine secures doctrinal coherence across loci: **divine simplicity** frames providence, **federal theology** frames hamartiology and atonement, **analogical knowledge** of God guards against collapsing Creator and creature, and union with Christ consummates the liberation of the will. In an age that oscillates between biological determinism and expressive individualism, the Augustinian–Reformed account alone tells the truth: we are more bound and more responsible than we think, and more liberated in Christ than we dared to hope.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Sin is privation and lawlessness rooted in disordered love; free will is the rational appetite acting from itself according to reasons. Fallen freedom is spontaneity under **moral inability**; grace restores libertas.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: disordered love, loss of libertas, efficacious grace, non posse non peccare.
  - Pelagius: libertarian capacity, grace as aid, denial of **original sin**.
  - Aquinas: privation theory, intellect–will, **secondary causality**, concurrence, concupiscence as fomes.
  - Luther: bondage of the will, necessity without compulsion, incurvatus in se.
  - Calvin: providence and decree, **federal theology**, concupiscence as sin, means and ends.
  - Edwards: **natural ability** vs **moral inability**, moral necessity, sourcehood responsibility, defense of **federal headship**.
- Debates:
  - Internal: immediate vs mediate imputation, concupiscence as sin, decree and authorship of sin under **secondary causality**.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian libertarianism, Thomist vs Molinist causality, Arminian alternative possibilities.
  - Contemporary: neuroscience and reasons-responsiveness, social sin and corporate guilt, Frankfurt cases, evolutionary challenges.
- Defended position: Augustinian–Reformed compatibilism affirming bound will under sin, real responsibility without alternative possibilities, Adamic **federal headship**, and divine ordination through **primary and secondary causality** with God not author of sin; grace is efficacious and liberating.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does decree make God author of sin? No, God causes the act as act and permits the defect; intentions differ, preserving holiness.
  - Is concupiscence sin in the regenerate? Yes, it is contrary to the law though not reigning.
  - How is imputation just? By divine covenantal constitution and societal headship, mirrored in Christ’s imputed righteousness.
  - Does ought imply can? In the natural, not the moral sense; duty exposes **moral inability** and drives to grace.
  - Why evangelize if God ordains all? He ordains ends and means; preaching is the appointed instrument of **effectual calling**.
