# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a rigorous doctrine of **original sin** and a compatibilist understanding of **free will**. He maintained that after the Fall, human **free will** is bound by **total depravity**, rendering humanity incapable of choosing spiritual good apart from **divine grace**. Turretin’s careful distinctions preserved human responsibility while upholding the necessity of **regeneration** for any movement toward God.

- "Free will is not taken away by the fall, but only its rectitude and liberty from sin." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- The Doctrine of Man (sections within Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)
- Francis Turretin: Theologian of the Protestant Reformed Tradition (secondary: James T. Dennison, Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction of Free Will’s States**
    - Divides human will into four states: innocence, fall, grace, and glory.
    - In the state of innocence, man possessed both the ability to sin and not to sin.
    - After the Fall, the will remains free in natural actions but is enslaved regarding spiritual good.
    - Only in the state of grace is the will liberated to choose spiritual good.
    - "The will is determined by its own corruption, not by external compulsion." (Institutes)

2. **Total Depravity and Moral Inability**
    - Asserts that original sin affects the whole person, especially the will.
    - Fallen humans retain natural liberty but lack moral ability to choose God.
    - Sin is not a loss of faculties, but a perversion of their direction.
    - Moral inability is compatible with responsibility, since it arises from voluntary corruption.
    - "Man is not forced to sin, but sins freely, though necessarily." (Institutes)

3. **Necessity and Contingency**
    - Defends a compatibilist view: human actions are necessary due to depravity, yet voluntary.
    - Rejects both Pelagian autonomy and fatalistic determinism.
    - Distinguishes between necessity of coercion (which he denies) and necessity of immutability (which he affirms post-Fall).
    - God’s providence and human responsibility coexist without contradiction.
    - "Necessity is consistent with liberty, provided it is not a necessity of compulsion." (Institutes)

4. **Role of Divine Grace**
    - Regeneration is necessary to restore true spiritual freedom.
    - Grace does not destroy the will but heals and elevates it.
    - The Spirit’s work is both efficacious and congruent with human faculties.
    - Without prevenient grace, fallen man cannot will any saving good.
    - "Grace does not act violently, but sweetly draws the will." (Institutes)

5. **Imputation and Guilt of Original Sin**
    - Adam’s sin is imputed to all his posterity, resulting in inherited guilt and corruption.
    - Original sin is both the lack of original righteousness and the presence of positive evil.
    - The bondage of the will is a just consequence of federal representation.
    - Only union with Christ can reverse the effects of imputed sin and restore freedom.
    - "By Adam’s fall, all his posterity lost liberty to good and became slaves of sin." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s nuanced treatment of **sin and free will** became foundational for later **Reformed orthodoxy**, especially in the development of the doctrine of **total depravity** and compatibilist freedom. His careful distinctions influenced confessional documents and shaped the teaching of seminaries in the Reformed tradition. Turretin’s legacy endures in contemporary discussions of human responsibility, original sin, and the necessity of grace for salvation. His work remains a touchstone for those defending the coherence of divine sovereignty and human accountability.
