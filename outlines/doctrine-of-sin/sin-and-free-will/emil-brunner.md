# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **sin** and **free will** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing both the reality of human responsibility and the pervasive effects of the **Fall**. He rejected both **Pelagian** optimism and deterministic **Augustinianism**, arguing that while humanity is radically corrupted by sin, the **imago Dei** is not utterly destroyed, allowing for a genuine, though limited, capacity to respond to God's grace.

- "Sin is not merely a defect or a weakness, but a positive turning away from God, a rebellion of the will." (Man in Revolt)

## Key Works

- Man in Revolt (Der Mensch im Widerspruch)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter
- The Mediator

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Rebellion and Estrangement**
    - Sin is fundamentally a relational rupture between humanity and God.
    - It is not merely ignorance or weakness but an active turning away of the will.
    - Sin affects the whole person, distorting reason, will, and relationships.
    - The universality of sin means all are implicated, yet personal responsibility remains.
    - "Sin is not a mere imperfection, but revolt against God." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Free Will within the Context of Divine Encounter**
    - Human freedom is real but always conditioned by the presence of God.
    - True freedom is found only in relationship with God, not in autonomous self-assertion.
    - The encounter with God’s Word confronts the will, enabling a genuine response.
    - Brunner rejects both determinism and libertarian free will as inadequate.
    - "Freedom is not the capacity to choose indifferently, but the power to obey God." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

3. **Imago Dei and the Remnants of Freedom**
    - The image of God in humanity is defaced but not erased by sin.
    - Even in rebellion, humans retain a capacity for relationship with God.
    - This remnant allows for the possibility of response to divine initiative.
    - The imago Dei grounds human dignity and responsibility amid corruption.
    - "The image of God is obscured, but not destroyed, by sin." (Man in Revolt)

4. **Grace as the Ground of Human Response**
    - Any movement toward God is initiated by divine grace, not human effort.
    - Grace does not coerce but awakens the will to respond freely.
    - Human decision is real, but always secondary to God’s prior action.
    - Brunner emphasizes the paradox of divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
    - "Grace does not destroy freedom, but creates it." (Truth as Encounter)

5. **Rejection of Both Pelagianism and Determinism**
    - Brunner critiques Pelagianism for overestimating human ability post-Fall.
    - He also rejects deterministic views that negate real human responsibility.
    - Theological anthropology must hold together the seriousness of sin and the reality of response.
    - The dialectical method is used to maintain this tension without synthesis.
    - "We must not choose between freedom and grace, but affirm both in paradox." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s nuanced approach to **sin** and **free will** influenced 20th-century Protestant thought, especially in the context of **dialectical theology**. His insistence on the paradox of divine initiative and human response shaped debates on **anthropology** and **soteriology**. While sometimes overshadowed by Barth, Brunner’s work remains significant for its balance between the seriousness of sin and the enduring dignity of the human person. His legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the relationship between grace, freedom, and responsibility.
