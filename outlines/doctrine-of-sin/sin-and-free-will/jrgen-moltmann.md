# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **sin and free will** through a distinctively **eschatological** and **Trinitarian** lens, emphasizing the relational and communal nature of human existence. He critiques traditional doctrines of **original sin** and **autonomous human will**, arguing that true freedom is realized within **God’s redemptive action** and the promise of **new creation**.

- "Sin is the experience of the God-forsakenness of the world, and freedom is the experience of the Spirit of life." (The Spirit of Life)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Spirit of Life: A Universal Affirmation (1991)
- God in Creation (1985)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as relational rupture**
    - Sin is not merely individual moral failure but a breakdown in relationship with God, others, and creation.
    - It is experienced as alienation, despair, and the loss of hope.
    - Sin manifests in social and structural forms, not just personal acts.
    - The cross reveals both the depth of human sin and God’s solidarity with the forsaken.
    - "Sin is the breaking off of relationship with God and with the world." (The Crucified God)

2. **Free will as participation in God’s future**
    - Human freedom is not autonomous self-determination but participation in the liberating future promised by God.
    - True freedom is **eschatological**, oriented toward the coming kingdom and new creation.
    - The **Spirit** empowers human beings to act in hope and resist the bondage of sin.
    - Freedom is realized in community, not isolation.
    - "Freedom is the power to begin something new, to anticipate the future of God." (The Spirit of Life)

3. **Critique of classical original sin**
    - Moltmann challenges Augustinian and Reformed formulations of **original sin** as inherited guilt.
    - He emphasizes the existential and historical dimensions of sin.
    - Sin is seen as a universal human reality, but not as a deterministic fate.
    - Redemption is not merely forgiveness but the restoration of human dignity and agency.
    - "Original sin is not a hereditary defect, but the universal experience of alienation." (God in Creation)

4. **Trinitarian context for freedom**
    - Human freedom reflects the relational freedom within the **Trinity**.
    - The **Spirit** draws humanity into the mutual love and openness of the triune God.
    - Sin is the refusal of this relational openness, leading to isolation and death.
    - The church is called to embody the freedom of the children of God.
    - "The freedom of the Spirit is the freedom of loving and being loved." (The Spirit of Life)

5. **Eschatological transformation of will**
    - The human will is healed and transformed by hope in God’s promised future.
    - **Eschatology** is not escapism but the ground for ethical action and resistance to evil.
    - The resurrection of Christ inaugurates the liberation of human will from the powers of sin and death.
    - Christian life is marked by anticipation of the world’s renewal, not resignation to its brokenness.
    - "Hope liberates the will from resignation and opens it to God’s possibilities." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology of **sin and free will** has reshaped contemporary discussions by integrating **eschatological hope** and a robust **Trinitarian framework**. His emphasis on relationality and the communal dimensions of sin challenges individualistic and deterministic models. Moltmann’s work has influenced liberation, political, and ecological theologies, encouraging a vision of human freedom grounded in the Spirit’s transformative power. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of sin, freedom, and the church’s role in the world.
