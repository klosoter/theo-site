# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches **sin** and **free will** from a robustly Reformed perspective, emphasizing the pervasive effects of **original sin** and the consequent bondage of the human will apart from **regeneration**. He insists that true human freedom is only realized in union with **Christ**, where the Spirit enables obedience that was impossible under the dominion of sin. Gaffin’s work highlights the eschatological transformation of the will in the believer, rooted in **Pauline theology**.

- "Apart from the Spirit, the will is in bondage to sin and incapable of pleasing God." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "Some Epistemological Reflections on 1 Corinthians 2:6-16" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and the Bondage of the Will**
   - Humanity’s will is radically affected by **original sin** and is not morally neutral.
   - The unregenerate are incapable of choosing true good or turning to God on their own.
   - Gaffin draws on **Paul’s anthropology** to argue that sin is not merely an act but a condition.
   - The will is enslaved to sin until liberated by the Holy Spirit.
   - "The will, as much as any other faculty, is subject to the pervasive effects of sin." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Necessity of Regeneration for True Freedom**
   - Regeneration is the decisive act that enables the will to respond to God.
   - The Spirit’s work is essential for breaking the dominion of sin over the will.
   - True freedom is not autonomy but the ability to obey God.
   - Gaffin stresses the **ordo salutis** as a framework for understanding the transformation of the will.
   - "Only in the new creation does the will begin to function as God intended." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Union with Christ as the Basis for Renewed Will**
   - Believers are united to Christ in his death and resurrection, which reorients the will.
   - The believer’s new identity in Christ empowers obedience.
   - The Spirit mediates the benefits of union, including renewal of the will.
   - Sanctification is both definitive and progressive, affecting the whole person.
   - "Union with Christ is the fountainhead of all spiritual renewal, including the will." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Eschatological Transformation of the Will**
   - The full liberation of the will is an eschatological reality, begun now but consummated in glory.
   - The tension between the “already” and “not yet” marks the believer’s struggle with sin.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling is the guarantee of future freedom from sin’s presence.
   - Gaffin emphasizes the resurrection as the ultimate hope for the will’s complete renewal.
   - "The resurrection is the final answer to the problem of sin’s hold on the will." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Rejection of Libertarian Free Will**
   - Gaffin affirms **compatibilism**: human responsibility is compatible with divine sovereignty.
   - He rejects the notion that true freedom requires the power of contrary choice.
   - The biblical view of freedom is positive: the ability to do what is pleasing to God.
   - Human choices are real and significant, but always under God’s sovereign providence.
   - "Scripture does not present freedom as autonomy, but as joyful service in the Spirit." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of **sin** and **free will** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions, especially in Pauline studies and the doctrine of salvation. His emphasis on **union with Christ** and the eschatological renewal of the will has influenced both academic and pastoral theology. Gaffin’s work continues to serve as a bridge between biblical exegesis and systematic theology, reinforcing the centrality of the Spirit’s work in overcoming the bondage of sin.
