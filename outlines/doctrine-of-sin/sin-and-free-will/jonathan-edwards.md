# Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758)

Jonathan Edwards developed a rigorous account of **sin** and **free will** within a **Reformed** framework, emphasizing the reality of human moral responsibility despite the pervasive effects of **original sin**. He argued that true **freedom** is not the liberty of indifference, but the ability to act according to one’s strongest inclinations, which are themselves shaped by a fallen nature apart from **regeneration**.

- "Men are not at liberty to choose contrary to their own inclinations, or to choose as they please, unless they please to choose." ("Freedom of the Will")

## Key Works

- Freedom of the Will (1754)
- Original Sin (1758)
- Religious Affections (1746)
- The Nature of True Virtue (posthumous, 1765)
- The Works of Jonathan Edwards (Yale Edition, vols. 1, 3, 21)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Moral Inability and Original Sin**
   - Humanity is born with a corrupt nature due to **Adam’s fall**.
   - **Moral inability** means sinners cannot choose good apart from divine grace.
   - Sin is not merely the absence of good, but an active inclination toward evil.
   - The will is always determined by the strongest motive, which in fallen humanity is sin.
   - "The inability which attends a state of corruption and sin, is not a want of faculty, but a want of will." (Freedom of the Will)

2. **Freedom as Acting According to One’s Nature**
   - True freedom is the power to act as one desires, not the power to choose contrary to one’s desires.
   - The will is not self-determining; it is governed by the strongest motive.
   - Human choices are always consistent with the prevailing disposition of the heart.
   - This view rejects the **Arminian** notion of the will’s indifference.
   - "The will always is as the greatest apparent good is." (Freedom of the Will)

3. **Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
   - God’s sovereignty is compatible with genuine human responsibility.
   - God ordains all things, including human choices, without violating moral agency.
   - Human beings are accountable because they act voluntarily, even though their choices are foreordained.
   - This upholds both **predestination** and moral culpability.
   - "God’s moral government and man’s moral agency are not inconsistent." (Freedom of the Will)

4. **Necessity and Contingency**
   - Edwards distinguishes between natural and moral necessity.
   - Moral necessity arises from the certainty of the will’s inclination, not external compulsion.
   - Contingency (chance) is excluded from the realm of moral action.
   - The certainty of sinful acts does not absolve guilt.
   - "That which is necessary with a moral necessity is as truly necessary as that which is so with a natural necessity." (Freedom of the Will)

5. **Regeneration as the Solution to Sinful Will**
   - Only the **Holy Spirit** can change the sinful disposition of the heart.
   - Regeneration imparts a new principle, enabling true freedom toward righteousness.
   - Without regeneration, the will remains enslaved to sin.
   - The new birth is a sovereign act of God, not a human achievement.
   - "The first effect of the power of God in the heart in regeneration, is to give the heart a divine taste or sense." (Religious Affections)

## Legacy and Impact

Edwards’s account of **sin and free will** profoundly shaped later **Reformed theology** and American evangelicalism, offering a robust alternative to both **Pelagian** and **Arminian** views. His articulation of moral inability and the necessity of regeneration remains influential in discussions of human depravity and divine grace. Edwards’s synthesis of philosophical rigor and theological depth continues to inform debates on **predestination**, responsibility, and the nature of true freedom.
