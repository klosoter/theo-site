# John Feinberg (1950– )

John Feinberg approaches **sin** and **free will** from a broadly **Reformed** yet modified perspective, emphasizing the reality of human moral responsibility within the context of **total depravity**. He affirms that while the **fall** has radically affected human nature, rendering people unable to choose God apart from grace, humans still make genuine choices for which they are accountable.

- "The Bible teaches both that man is responsible for his actions and that God is sovereign over all that happens." (No One Like Him)

## Key Works

- No One Like Him: The Doctrine of God (2001)
- The Many Faces of Evil: Theological Systems and the Problem of Evil (1994, rev. 2004)
- Ethics for a Brave New World (with Paul Feinberg, 1993, 2010)
- Continuity and Discontinuity: Perspectives on the Relationship Between the Old and New Testaments (ed., 1988)
- Light in a Dark Place: The Doctrine of Scripture (2018)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Moral Inability**
    - Human nature is thoroughly corrupted by **original sin** due to Adam’s fall.
    - People are incapable of choosing God or true good apart from divine intervention.
    - This inability is moral, not metaphysical; humans still make real choices.
    - The doctrine safeguards the necessity of **grace** for salvation.
    - "Because of sin, man is unable to do anything spiritually good or pleasing to God." (No One Like Him)

2. **Compatibilist Free Will**
    - Feinberg affirms **compatibilism**: human freedom is compatible with divine sovereignty.
    - Choices are genuinely voluntary, though determined by one’s nature and desires.
    - God’s sovereignty does not negate human responsibility for sin.
    - This view rejects libertarian free will as unbiblical.
    - "Human freedom is not the ability to do otherwise, but to act according to one’s strongest desires." (No One Like Him)

3. **God’s Sovereignty Over Sin**
    - God ordains all that comes to pass, including sinful acts, without being the author of sin.
    - Divine sovereignty is exhaustive and meticulous, encompassing even evil.
    - God’s permission of sin serves his ultimate purposes and glory.
    - Human agents remain culpable for their sinful choices.
    - "God can ordain evil without himself being evil or the author of sin." (The Many Faces of Evil)

4. **Human Accountability**
    - Despite total depravity, humans are held accountable for their actions.
    - Accountability is grounded in God’s justice and the reality of moral choice.
    - The inability to choose good does not excuse sin, since it is a willful inability.
    - Divine judgment is just because humans act according to their desires.
    - "God holds people responsible because they freely choose according to their own desires, even though those desires are corrupted." (No One Like Him)

5. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
    - Only **regenerating grace** can overcome the bondage of the will to sin.
    - The Holy Spirit enables the sinner to respond positively to the gospel.
    - Regeneration precedes and enables faith, not vice versa.
    - Salvation is entirely a work of God’s grace, not human merit.
    - "No one comes to Christ unless the Father draws him and the Spirit gives new life." (No One Like Him)

## Legacy and Impact

John Feinberg has significantly shaped contemporary **evangelical theology** on the relationship between **sin**, **free will**, and **divine sovereignty**. His clear articulation of compatibilism and robust defense of total depravity have influenced both academic and pastoral discussions. Feinberg’s work continues to serve as a bridge between traditional Reformed thought and broader evangelical concerns, especially regarding the problem of evil and human responsibility. His nuanced approach remains a key reference point for those wrestling with the complexities of sin and freedom.
