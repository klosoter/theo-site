# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **sin** and **free will** with a strong emphasis on the pervasive reality of **human depravity** and the existential seriousness of **human responsibility**. He rejected both deterministic and Pelagian extremes, arguing that **original sin** fundamentally affects the will, yet does not destroy the reality of human choice and accountability before God. Berkouwer’s nuanced analysis sought to uphold the **Reformed doctrine of total depravity** while maintaining the meaningfulness of human decisions in the drama of redemption.

- "Sin does not abolish responsibility, but rather presupposes it." (Sin, Studies in Dogmatics)

## Key Works

- Sin (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Man: The Image of God (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Faith and Justification (Studies in Dogmatics)
- The Providence of God (Studies in Dogmatics)
- The Conflict with Rome (for context on anthropology and grace)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Disruption of Relationship**
    - Sin is fundamentally a **rupture in the relationship** between God and humanity.
    - It is not merely a violation of law, but a turning away from God as the source of life.
    - This disruption affects all aspects of human existence, including the will.
    - Sin’s reality is existential and relational, not just juridical.
    - "Sin is not a thing, but a break in the relationship with God." (Sin)

2. **Total Depravity and the Will**
    - Berkouwer affirms the **Reformed doctrine of total depravity**.
    - The will is radically affected by sin, but not annihilated.
    - Human freedom is not lost, but is now in bondage to sin.
    - The concept of “inability” must be understood in light of ongoing responsibility.
    - "The inability of man does not mean the absence of responsibility." (Sin)

3. **Rejection of Determinism and Pelagianism**
    - Berkouwer critiques both deterministic and Pelagian views of the will.
    - He insists that grace does not coerce, but liberates the will.
    - Human choices are real, even under the sway of sin.
    - The mystery of human freedom under sin resists simplistic explanation.
    - "The reality of sin does not make man a puppet." (Sin)

4. **Original Sin and Human Solidarity**
    - Original sin is not merely inherited guilt, but a shared existential condition.
    - All humanity participates in Adam’s fall and its consequences.
    - This solidarity means all are both corrupted and responsible.
    - The doctrine of original sin underscores the need for **divine grace**.
    - "Original sin is not a biological or metaphysical transmission, but a solidarity in guilt." (Sin)

5. **Grace and the Restoration of Freedom**
    - Only **God’s grace** in Christ can restore true human freedom.
    - Regeneration renews the will, enabling genuine obedience.
    - The work of the Holy Spirit is essential for liberation from sin’s bondage.
    - Salvation is not mechanical, but personal and transformative.
    - "Grace does not destroy the will, but restores it." (Sin)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s careful articulation of **sin** and **free will** has shaped modern Reformed theology, especially in its engagement with existential and relational dimensions of doctrine. His refusal to collapse human responsibility into determinism or autonomy has influenced both academic and pastoral discussions. By emphasizing the ongoing significance of **divine grace** and the seriousness of human choice, Berkouwer provided a nuanced framework for understanding the human predicament and the hope of redemption. His work continues to be a touchstone for those wrestling with the complexities of sin and freedom in the Christian life.
