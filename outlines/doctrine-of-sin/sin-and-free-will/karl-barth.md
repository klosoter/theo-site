# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically reoriented the doctrines of **sin** and **free will** by emphasizing the utter dependence of humanity on the **grace of God** revealed in **Jesus Christ**. He rejected both **Pelagian** and **semi-Pelagian** notions of autonomous human freedom, insisting that true freedom is found only in **obedient response** to divine revelation and that **sin** is fundamentally a rejection of this relationship.

- "Sin is the contradiction of the divine command, and therefore of the divine being, and therefore of the being of man himself." ("Church Dogmatics," II/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics, Volumes I/2, II/1, IV/1
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Dogmatics in Outline
- Karl Barth: A Biography (Eberhard Busch)
- The Humanity of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Rebellion Against God**
   - Sin is not merely a moral failing but a radical **opposition to God’s will**.
   - It is characterized by humanity’s attempt to assert autonomy apart from God.
   - Barth sees sin as a **theological problem** before it is an ethical one.
   - Sin disrupts the proper relationship between Creator and creature.
   - "Sin is unbelief, man’s refusal to accept his creaturely being and his attempt to be as God." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

2. **Human Freedom is Defined by Grace**
   - True **freedom** is not natural to fallen humanity but is a gift of God.
   - Human will is bound and liberated only in encounter with **God’s revelation**.
   - Freedom is realized in **obedience** to God, not in autonomous self-determination.
   - Barth rejects the idea of a neutral or undetermined human will after the Fall.
   - "Man is free for God only as he is made free by God." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

3. **Christocentric Anthropology**
   - The meaning of human existence, including freedom, is found in **Jesus Christ**.
   - Christ is both the judge and the redeemer of sinful humanity.
   - In Christ, the true image of God and the true freedom of man are revealed.
   - Sin and freedom must be understood in light of the **incarnation** and **atonement**.
   - "In Jesus Christ, God has taken the place of the sinner." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Rejection of Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism**
   - Barth opposes any doctrine that attributes saving initiative to human will.
   - He insists that **grace precedes and enables** all human response.
   - Human cooperation with grace is itself the result of God’s prior action.
   - The will is not a neutral faculty but is corrupted by sin apart from grace.
   - "Grace is not an aid alongside human freedom, but its presupposition and source." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

5. **Sin as Universal and Radical**
   - Sin affects all aspects of human existence, not just isolated acts.
   - There is no “neutral” ground from which humans can choose God unaided.
   - The universality of sin underscores the necessity of **divine election** and **reconciliation**.
   - Barth denies any optimistic view of human moral capacity post-Fall.
   - "All men are in Adam, and therefore all are sinners." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s doctrine of **sin and free will** decisively shaped twentieth-century Protestant theology, challenging both liberal optimism and traditional scholasticism. His emphasis on the **sovereignty of grace** and the Christological grounding of human freedom continues to influence Reformed and ecumenical discussions. Barth’s work remains a touchstone for debates on **original sin**, human agency, and the nature of salvation, ensuring his ongoing relevance in systematic theology.
