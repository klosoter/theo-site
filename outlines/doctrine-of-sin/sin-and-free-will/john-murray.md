# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached **sin** and **free will** from a rigorously **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the pervasive effects of **original sin** and the consequent **bondage of the will**. He maintained that human freedom is always conditioned by the moral state of the heart, and that true liberty is found only in **redemption** through Christ, not in autonomous self-determination.

- "The will of man is never independent of the moral and spiritual condition of his nature." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- The Epistle to the Romans (especially commentary on Romans 5 and 7)
- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- Principles of Conduct
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- The Imputation of Adam’s Sin

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and the Bondage of the Will**
    - Humanity’s will is enslaved to sin as a result of the Fall.
    - There is no area of human nature untouched by the corruption of **original sin**.
    - The sinner cannot choose spiritual good apart from divine grace.
    - The will is not destroyed but is in bondage to a sinful nature.
    - "The effect of sin is not to destroy the faculty of willing but to enslave it." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Original Sin and Imputation**
    - Adam’s first transgression is imputed to all his descendants.
    - All humans are born with a corrupt nature and a propensity toward sin.
    - The doctrine of **imputation** underscores the solidarity of the human race in sin.
    - The guilt and corruption of sin are both inherited and actualized.
    - "The doctrine of original sin is integral to the biblical view of man’s plight." (The Imputation of Adam’s Sin)

3. **Necessity of Regeneration for True Freedom**
    - True spiritual freedom is only possible through **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit.
    - Regeneration renews the will, enabling the sinner to respond to God.
    - Apart from regeneration, the will remains in bondage to sin.
    - The new birth is a sovereign act of God, not a cooperative effort.
    - "Regeneration is the prerequisite of all spiritual activity that is pleasing to God." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Compatibilism: Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God’s sovereignty is fully compatible with genuine human responsibility.
    - Human choices are real and significant, though always under God’s providence.
    - The will acts according to its strongest inclination, shaped by the heart’s disposition.
    - Divine grace does not coerce but liberates the will to choose the good.
    - "The sovereignty of God and the responsibility of man are not antithetical but complementary." (Principles of Conduct)

5. **Sin as Ethical Antithesis**
    - Sin is fundamentally ethical rebellion against God’s law.
    - The will is always oriented either toward God or against Him.
    - The antithesis between sin and righteousness is absolute, not relative.
    - The gospel alone provides deliverance from the dominion of sin.
    - "Sin is not simply a defect; it is positive enmity against God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of **total depravity** and the **bondage of the will** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians and pastors, especially within the Westminster tradition. His careful exegesis and systematic clarity provided a bulwark against both Pelagian and semi-Pelagian tendencies in modern theology. By rooting human freedom in the context of redemption, Murray reinforced the necessity of **sovereign grace** for salvation and sanctification. His legacy endures in contemporary discussions on the nature of sin, freedom, and divine sovereignty.
