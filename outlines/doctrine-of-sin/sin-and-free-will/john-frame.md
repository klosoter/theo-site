# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **sin** and **free will** through the lens of his **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing the interplay of **divine sovereignty**, **human responsibility**, and the **covenantal context** of ethical action. He affirms the **Reformed doctrine of total depravity**, arguing that human freedom is always exercised within the bounds of God’s sovereign decree, yet without negating genuine moral agency.

- "God’s sovereignty and human responsibility are not contradictory, but complementary perspectives on the same reality." (Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- No Other God: A Response to Open Theism (2001)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Triperspectival Analysis of Sin**
    - Sin must be understood from the **normative** (God’s law), **situational** (circumstances), and **existential** (heart motives) perspectives.
    - Each perspective reveals different facets of how sin distorts human freedom.
    - Sin is not merely an act but a condition affecting every aspect of human life.
    - This approach integrates biblical data with systematic reflection.
    - "Sin is a violation of God’s law, a distortion of the situation, and a corruption of the heart." (Doctrine of the Christian Life)

2. **Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty**
    - God ordains all that comes to pass, including human choices.
    - Divine sovereignty is compatible with meaningful human action.
    - Human freedom operates within the boundaries of God’s eternal decree.
    - This sovereignty does not make God the author of sin.
    - "God’s control is exhaustive, but it does not eliminate the significance of our decisions." (Doctrine of God)

3. **Compatibilist View of Free Will**
    - Human will is free in the sense that people act according to their desires.
    - These desires are shaped by their sinful nature apart from grace.
    - Freedom is not autonomy from God, but the ability to act according to one’s nature.
    - True freedom is restored only in union with Christ.
    - "Biblical freedom is not autonomy, but the ability to do what pleases God." (Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Total Depravity and Moral Inability**
    - All humans are born in a state of sin, unable to choose God apart from grace.
    - Sin affects intellect, will, and affections, rendering the will morally unable to please God.
    - This inability is ethical, not metaphysical; humans remain responsible.
    - Regeneration is necessary for any truly free act toward God.
    - "The sinner’s inability is not an excuse, but part of his guilt." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

5. **Covenantal Context of Responsibility**
    - Human responsibility is defined within the context of God’s covenant relationship.
    - The law, gospel, and Spirit work together to shape moral agency.
    - Accountability is measured by God’s revealed standards, not autonomous reason.
    - The covenant frames both the problem of sin and the hope of redemption.
    - "Responsibility is always responsibility to God, in the context of his covenant." (Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **sin** and **free will** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially through his **triperspectival** method. His compatibilist approach has provided clarity for those wrestling with the relationship between **divine sovereignty** and **human responsibility**. Frame’s influence endures in both academic and pastoral circles, equipping theologians and church leaders to address ethical and doctrinal challenges with biblical fidelity and philosophical rigor.
