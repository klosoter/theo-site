# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the doctrines of **sin** and **free will** within a framework of **religious consciousness** and **God-consciousness**. He rejected traditional notions of inherited guilt, instead viewing sin as a universal condition arising from the disruption of the God-consciousness, while free will is understood as the capacity for self-determination within the context of human dependence on God.

- "Sin is simply the lack of God-consciousness, and the restoration from sin is the restoration of this consciousness." ("The Christian Faith")

- Schleiermacher: Hermeneutics and Criticism (ed. Andrew Bowie)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Disruption of God-Consciousness**
   - Sin is not a legal or forensic status but a disturbance in the individual's God-consciousness.
   - All humans share in this disruption, making sin universal but not inherited in a juridical sense.
   - The essence of sin is alienation from the divine, not merely the commission of wrongful acts.
   - Restoration from sin is the renewal of God-consciousness through Christ.
   - "Sin is the disturbance of the feeling of absolute dependence." ("The Christian Faith")

2. **Rejection of Traditional Original Sin**
   - Schleiermacher denies the transmission of guilt from Adam to humanity.
   - Original sin is reinterpreted as a universal tendency rather than a legal imputation.
   - The solidarity of the human race is emphasized, but without forensic categories.
   - Sinfulness is a shared existential condition, not a substance or inherited stain.
   - "The doctrine of original sin must be understood as the universality of sin, not as inherited guilt." ("The Christian Faith")

3. **Free Will as Self-Determination within Dependence**
   - Human freedom is exercised within the context of absolute dependence on God.
   - Free will is not autonomy from God but the capacity to act in accordance with one's God-consciousness.
   - The will is shaped by the interplay of divine influence and human response.
   - True freedom is realized in the restoration of God-consciousness, not in self-assertion.
   - "Freedom is not independence from God, but the capacity to act in harmony with the divine will." ("The Christian Faith")

4. **Christ as the Exemplar and Restorer**
   - Christ uniquely embodies perfect God-consciousness, serving as the model for humanity.
   - Redemption is the communication of Christ's God-consciousness to believers.
   - The work of Christ restores the possibility of true freedom and overcomes sin's disruption.
   - The church is the community in which this restoration is actualized.
   - "In Christ, the God-consciousness is absolutely original and complete." ("The Christian Faith")

5. **Sin and Redemption as Existential Realities**
   - Sin and redemption are experienced realities, not merely doctrinal affirmations.
   - The transformation of the self is central to Schleiermacher's soteriology.
   - The focus is on the inner life and the renewal of consciousness, rather than external acts.
   - Redemption is ongoing, realized in the life of the believing community.
   - "Redemption is the progressive restoration of the God-consciousness in the individual and the community." ("The Christian Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher's reconfiguration of **sin** and **free will** shifted the focus of theology from forensic categories to the dynamics of **religious experience** and consciousness. His influence is foundational for modern liberal theology, shaping subsequent discussions of human nature, freedom, and the meaning of redemption. While his views have been critiqued for downplaying the objective reality of sin, his emphasis on the existential and communal dimensions of faith continues to inform contemporary theological reflection.
