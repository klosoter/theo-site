### ESSAY
Any competent defense of sin and free will must begin by clarifying what is meant by both terms. In classic Christian theology, **sin** is not first a list of acts but an ethical condition of the will. It is **privation of original righteousness** and positive inclination to the wrong ultimate end, namely self rather than God. **Free will** in the Augustinian and Reformed tradition does not mean an autonomous power of self origination of choices, but a rational spontaneity by which the agent acts according to what he most wants in view of his character, without external coercion. The tension at the center of the doctrine is this: fallen humanity is said to be in a state of **total depravity** and **moral inability**, unable not to sin and unable to turn to God, and yet Scripture and conscience testify that human beings are truly responsible, blameworthy, and commanded to repent. Unless the relation between sin and free will is articulated with precision, one either denies the depth of sin to protect responsibility or denies responsibility to protect sovereignty.

The decisive starting point here is Augustine. His anti-Pelagian work reframed the grammar of both sin and freedom for the entire Western tradition. Augustine reads Paul as teaching that all humanity is **in Adam**, bearing both his guilt and a profoundly damaged nature. Before the fall, Adam possessed what Augustine calls the posse peccare et posse non peccare, the possibility of sinning and not sinning; after the fall, the will is incurvatus in se, curved in on itself, so that fallen man is non posse non peccare, not able not to sin. This is the doctrine of **moral inability**: not a removal of the faculty of choice, but a bondage of the will’s love. The will remains a rational appetite, choosing what it deems good, but the scale of its evaluation is corrupted. For Augustine, therefore, the heart of **original sin** is a vitiated love that makes wicked acts voluntary and yet inevitable apart from grace.

Examiners will push at this point: if the will is not able not to sin, and yet sin is voluntary, is this not a contradiction? Augustine’s answer, which sets the pattern for later compatibilism, is that necessity and coercion are distinct. Fallen man necessarily sins in the sense that his corrupted will will always incline away from God unless renewed, but he is not coerced, dragged contrary to what he wants. He sins because he wants to. The necessity is internal, grounded in his own disposition, not imposed from without. This permits Augustine to deny Pelagius’s claim that the will must retain sheer indifference between good and evil to be responsible. For Augustine, responsibility requires that the act proceed from the agent with knowledge and consent, not that the agent have equal power to contrary alternatives at the moment of action.

This Augustinian anchor will be contested by an examiner invoking the objection: does not responsibility require the power to do otherwise? Here the Augustinian tradition responds that all that is needed for responsibility is **alternative possibilities** at the level of deliberation and capacity in the abstract faculty sense, not that the agent, given all prior conditions including his character and God’s decree, could in fact have chosen otherwise in the very moment. He could have done otherwise if he were differently disposed, but he is not so disposed because of a culpable history rooted in Adam and ratified by his own sin.

Thomas Aquinas receives Augustine but refines the metaphysical account of will and causality in ways crucial for understanding how God can be **first cause** of all things and yet not the author of sin. Aquinas develops a robust account of **secondary causality** and **divine concursus**. God as pure act and **first cause** gives esse and concurrent motion to all created causes, including the will. Every act of willing derives its ontological actuality from God’s universal causality. However, the moral specification of the act, whether good or evil, derives from the proximate agent’s form and end. When a sinner wills an evil end, God is the cause that the act is, but not the cause that the act is evil. The defect lies solely in the creaturely cause.

Aquinas’s elaboration of **freedom of choice** is also instructive. The will is free because it is ordered to the universal good under the light of reason, and finite goods are apprehended under some aspect of goodness such that the will can deliberate and choose among them. In the state of fallen nature, man can perform civilly good acts but is unable to will God as his last end without healing and elevating grace. This is a form of moral inability aligned with Augustine, though Aquinas nuances the corruption as a wounding rather than absolute destruction of natural powers. Internal Roman debates emerge later over whether this wound allows for any unaided movement toward God in the order of nature. But at the level of sin and free will, Aquinas will insist that sin is always voluntary, because it proceeds from the will’s free inclination to a disordered end under some perceived good. For him too, necessity of inclination that arises from one’s habitus or character does not remove freedom, so long as the will is not coerced.

An examiner sympathetic to libertarian accounts may push: if God is universally concurring with every act of the will, is he not implicated in the sin? Aquinas’s distinction between **deficient cause** and **perfect cause** is relevant. God’s causality is always perfect and ordered to good, providing the act’s positive being. The moral defect arises from the creature’s withdrawal from right order, a kind of nonbeing. God does not have to cause this defect for it to occur; the creature’s finitude and mutability suffice. Thus Aquinas can uphold both God’s universal causality and the creature’s responsibility, while denying that God is author of sin.

The Reformation reopens the question of sin and freedom under the pressure of late medieval synergism. Martin Luther’s debate with Erasmus in De Servo Arbitrio is decisive. Luther radicalizes Augustine’s **bondage of the will** to repel any notion that fallen man can cooperate with grace at the first moment. For Luther, free choice in spiritual matters is a “mere title,” because the will is captive to Satan and sin. Yet Luther is not a fatalist. His bond of the will is again moral and spiritual, not metaphysical. The sinner acts willingly, not by compulsion. The polemical edge of Luther’s denial of free will is aimed at a semi-Pelagian use of a supposed neutral faculty to secure human contribution to salvation.

An examiner may attack Luther as incoherent: if the will is bound, how can the call to repent be sincere? Luther’s answer would mirror Augustine: the moral law addresses what man ought to do, not what he can do in his own strength. The command exposes inability, drives to despair of self, and prepares for grace. The norm of obligation is God’s holy will, not human capacity. This is coherent if one maintains the distinction between natural and moral inability: human beings retain the natural faculty of will and reason, but have lost the moral power to will spiritual good for the right end. Because they act from their own desires and loves, they remain accountable.

John Calvin consolidates this Reformation trajectory with a more explicit doctrinal architecture. Calvin’s doctrine of **original sin** is twofold: inherited guilt and pervasive corruption. Through Adam’s **federal headship**, the human race is constituted under condemnation and a depraved nature. This is embedded in Reformed **federal theology** and later systematized in covenant categories, but the conceptual point is that human nature as such, in Adam, becomes a mass of perdition. Calvin insists, following Augustine, that the will is not destroyed but **unfreed**. Man acts willingly in all his sins, yet his will is “so bound by the yoke of sin” that it can will nothing but evil until liberated by grace.

Calvin, more than Luther, explicitly integrates this with high **divine sovereignty** and **predestination**. God’s eternal decree encompasses all events, including sinful acts. Yet Calvin carefully distinguishes between God’s righteous purpose in ordaining, and the wicked intention of secondary agents. He uses strong language of divine “willing” and “ordaining” sin, but simultaneously denies that God is the author of sin. This tension is a favorite examiner’s pressure point: is the denial more than a bare assertion? The Reformed scholastic development of Calvin offers the more precise answer in the categories refined from Aquinas: God’s decree is the sufficient condition for the act’s occurrence, but not the sufficient condition for the act’s moral disorder. God wills to permit and direct sin for wise ends, concurrence gives the act its being, but the defect that makes it sin belongs entirely to the creature. Thus God’s providence is exhaustive and yet his holiness is preserved.

Jonathan Edwards, in the eighteenth century, is the decisive figure who gives the classic Reformed defense of **compatibilist freedom** in Freedom of the Will. Edwards directly tackles the philosophical debate about whether freedom requires the power of contrary choice. He argues that the will is determined by the strongest motive as perceived by the mind. This is not a mechanical determination but a moral and psychological one. The essence of freedom is doing what one wants, not self causation of wants. If your examiner presses on whether this makes us mere puppets of prior causes, the Edwardsian answer is that the chain of causes includes the agent’s own character and dispositions, which are themselves morally evaluated. To be responsible is to be the kind of person who wants what you want, not to be causa sui.

Edwards is particularly helpful in unpacking **moral inability**. He distinguishes natural inability, where something external or a lack of faculty prevents you from doing what you will, from moral inability, where your own disposition is such that you cannot will the right. Only natural inability excuses from obligation. Moral inability, because it is rooted in your will and affections, is itself the ground of blame. Fallen man cannot love God because he hates God, and he hates God because his nature is corrupt. This inability is culpable, not exculpatory. This provides the clearest conceptual defense against the objection that inability cancels responsibility.

An external libertarian critic, Christian or secular, will insist that without the ability to choose otherwise in exactly the same conditions, praise and blame are unjust. Edwards responds by showing that this demand is incoherent. If all conditions including the agent’s character and motives are held fixed, a different choice would be an irrational randomness, not a morally grounded decision. Moreover, Scripture does not depict freedom as indeterminacy but as self expressed inclination. “Everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin” and yet “everyone who practices sin practices lawlessness” are compatible because slavery here is the entrenched pattern of one’s own rebellious loves.

Within the Augustinian and Reformed tradition, there are important internal debates about the extent of damage wrought by **original sin** and the remaining natural powers of the will. Some strands, influenced by Aquinas, emphasize that even in the fallen state the will has a real though limited capacity for civil righteousness and can cooperate with common grace. Others, following Luther’s more radical language, stress the total moral ruin in spiritual matters. Contemporary Reformed compatibilists sometimes differ on how to frame the relation between character, divine decree, and counterfactual freedom. Some will grant a weak form of ability to do otherwise at the level of modal metaphysics, others reject it as unnecessary. These internal differences, however, operate within a shared core: that sin has rendered the will morally unable to turn to God, that this inability does not remove responsibility because the will acts from its own corrupt nature, and that God’s sovereignty is meticulous yet noncomplicit in evil.

On the external side, Pelagian and semi-Pelagian views deny or mitigate **original sin** as inherited guilt and deep corruption. Pelagius essentially treats Adam as merely a bad example and insists that each soul is created morally neutral with undamaged free will. Sin, then, is only a sequence of bad choices. Semi-Pelagian positions soften this but still preserve an island of moral neutrality, often located in the will’s purported ability to make an initial movement toward God. The Reformed response is that such views cannot account for the universality and intractability of sin, undercut the necessity and gratuity of grace, and collide with Romans 5’s **federal** account of Adamic solidarity. If one’s examiner pushes whether inherited guilt is just, the answer must appeal to the covenantal and corporate nature of humanity. God constituted Adam as the representative head; his act is legally and organically ours. Because this is the structure by which Christ’s righteousness is later imputed, to object to federal representation in Adam is to undermine the parallel in Christ.

Roman Catholic synergism, especially in some post Tridentine forms, maintains **concursus** and the necessity of grace but affirms that the will can resist or cooperate in such a way that the efficacy of grace is not intrinsically determining. This can shade into a kind of indeterminist freedom at the moment of cooperation. The Augustinian–Reformed criticism is that this reintroduces a pocket of self determining will that escapes both the corruption of original sin and the efficacy of grace, creating an unstable dualism in the order of salvation. However, one must be careful to distinguish strong Augustinian Catholic strands from weaker ones; not all Catholic theology is semi-Pelagian.

In contemporary analytic philosophy of religion, the free will debate is often recast in highly technical terms: **libertarianism** versus **compatibilism**, with some opting for hard determinism or skeptical positions. Christian libertarians like Alvin Plantinga or Robert Kane contend that morally significant freedom requires that, given all prior conditions and God’s nonintervention, the agent could have chosen otherwise. They fear that compatibilism makes God the author of sin and empties moral life of real alternative possibilities. A Reformed compatibilist position, building on Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, and Edwards, maintains that such alternative possibilities are either illusory or unnecessary. True alternatives exist in the deliberative horizon and in the modal sense that, were the heart different, the choice would be different. But at the moment of action, the strongest motive in light of the agent’s character determines the will. God’s decree ensures that history unfolds according to his plan, but creatures act as real secondary causes whose acts retain full moral significance.

A contemporary pastoral challenge arises from trauma, addiction, and social conditioning. Counselors and theologians confront situations where individuals seem practically unable to avoid certain destructive behaviors. Does the doctrine of moral responsibility in a compatibilist, original sin framework take seriously such constraints? The answer should be nuanced. Classical theology has long recognized gradations of voluntariness, diminished culpability due to ignorance or coercion, and complex mixtures of habit and choice. The doctrine of **original sin** actually provides a framework for understanding how deeply embedded patterns of evil can shape the will. Yet it insists that even in the midst of such influences, the human person is not a mere mechanism. There remain real acts of consent, ratification, and resistance. Pastoral sensitivity may lead us to recognize mitigated guilt in some cases, but the basic structure of responsibility as grounded in voluntary action according to one’s desires remains intact.

At this point, the examiner may press the hardest question: if God, from eternity, decreed that a particular person would commit a specific sin, and if the person’s will is determined by their nature and motives as part of that decree, how is God not the author of sin? The Reformed answer, following our line from Augustine through Aquinas and Calvin to Edwards, is multi layered. First, the distinction between **efficient causality** and **defect** must be maintained. God efficiently causes the existence and concurrence of every act, but the privation that constitutes its sinfulness is not a positive entity requiring causal production. Second, God has different relations to good and evil: he efficaciously brings about good as good, but he wills to permit evil as evil, ordering it to wise and holy ends without endorsing the evil as such. Third, the creature’s will is the proximate source of the evil; the agent sins because he prefers darkness to light. This preference is itself blameworthy, both due to Adamic representation and personal ratification. Fourth, Scripture itself holds together divine ordination and human culpability without embarrassment, as in the crucifixion of Christ, where wicked men “did what your hand and your plan had predestined to take place” yet are condemned. Any theological account must echo that pattern.

The position to be defended, then, is a robust Augustinian–Reformed compatibilist account of sin and free will. Sin is a state of **original corruption and guilt** rooted in Adamic headship and expressed in every faculty. The will remains a real, rational appetite, but it is bound by corrupted loves and thus morally unable to choose God. Freedom is not autonomy from God or indeterminate self origination, but the unhindered exercise of one’s own powers in line with one’s character and desires. Therefore fallen acts are both determined in the sense of being certain under God’s decree and the sinner’s nature, and free in the sense of being voluntary and noncoerced. Accountability is grounded not in abstract power to do otherwise at the moment, but in the agent’s owning of the act, flowing from his own corrupt heart.

This doctrine interlocks with adjacent loci. In anthropology, it shapes our understanding of the image of God as marred yet not destroyed. In soteriology, it undergirds the necessity of **irresistible grace** and monergistic regeneration, since a will in bondage cannot cooperate in its own liberation. In Christology, it highlights the sinlessness and impeccability of Christ, whose human will was fully free yet incapable of sin, providing a paradigm where necessity and freedom coexist without contradiction. In eschatology, it anticipates the state of glory, where the saints will be unable to sin yet perfectly free, echoing Augustine’s non posse peccare as the consummation of grace.

Defending this position under oral examination requires holding several lines simultaneously without confusion: the depth of **original sin** without denying natural faculties, the reality of **moral inability** without exculpation, the fullness of **divine sovereignty** without making God author of sin, and the authenticity of **human freedom** without libertarian indeterminism. The tradition from Augustine through Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and Edwards supplies the conceptual tools to do this. The examiner’s sharpest questions will revolve around justice, responsibility, and divine holiness. The answer must return, again and again, to the distinction between nature and act, necessity and coercion, efficient cause and defect, and to the biblical pattern where God ordains and judges sin without himself sinning. So framed, the Augustinian–Reformed compatibilist account of sin and free will is not an embarrassment to be minimized, but a coherent and pastorally potent articulation of Scripture’s witness to the enslaved and yet accountable human heart under the sovereign, holy God.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Sin** is inherited guilt and pervasive corruption of human nature under **original sin**, producing a **moral inability** to love God; **free will** is the rational, voluntary inclination of the person acting from his own character and desires without external coercion, compatible with divine decree.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: original sin as inherited guilt and bondage of the will, freedom as voluntary action amid moral necessity.
  - Aquinas: secondary causality and **divine concursus**, God as first cause of act’s being but not its defect.
  - Luther: bondage of the will in spiritual things, polemic against Erasmus’s synergism.
  - Calvin: **federal headship**, total depravity, meticulous providence without divine authorship of sin.
  - Edwards: detailed **compatibilist freedom**, natural vs moral inability, will determined by strongest motive.
- Debates:
  - Internal: degrees of damage from original sin, nature vs extent of **moral inability**, nuances of Reformed compatibilism.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian libertarianism, Roman Catholic synergism, analytic libertarianism and determinism.
  - Contemporary: trauma and addiction and responsibility, analytic free will puzzles, divine authorship of sin objections.
- Defended position: Augustinian–Reformed **compatibilism** in which sinners, under **original sin**, act freely in the sense of voluntary, noncoerced action determined by corrupt desires and nature, so are justly responsible, while God’s exhaustive decree and concursive causality render him sovereign without making him the author of sin.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - If man cannot not sin, how is he responsible? Moral inability arises from his own corrupt will; responsibility tracks voluntariness, not abstract power of contrary choice.
  - Does God’s decree make him author of sin? God causes the act’s being, not its moral defect; he wills to permit and order evil without approving it, and the creature’s will is the proximate source of sin.
  - Is inherited guilt just? Adam acts as covenantal and natural head; as in Christ’s imputed righteousness, corporate representation grounds both condemnation and salvation.
  - How is Christ free if he cannot sin? Freedom is acting according to one’s perfected nature without coercion; impeccability secures, not negates, his highest freedom.
  - Do addiction and trauma mitigate responsibility? They can diminish voluntariness in specific acts, but do not erase the basic structure of responsible agency grounded in the will’s consent and character.
