# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale approaches **sin** and **free will** through the lens of **biblical theology**, emphasizing the pervasive effects of the **fall** and the necessity of **divine grace** for true freedom. He highlights how **idolatry** distorts human will, rendering it captive to sin, and insists that only through **union with Christ** can the will be liberated and restored to its intended purpose.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Idolatry and Deformation**
    - Sin is fundamentally a matter of misplaced worship, leading to spiritual and moral deformation.
    - Idolatry shapes human character, causing people to become like what they worship.
    - The biblical narrative consistently links sin to the rejection of God for created things.
    - The consequences of idolatry are both individual and corporate, affecting the will and desires.
    - "Idolatry is not only a failure to obey God, it is a setting of the whole heart on something besides God." (We Become What We Worship)

2. **The Bondage of the Will Post-Fall**
    - After the fall, human will is enslaved to sin and unable to choose true good apart from grace.
    - The Old Testament and New Testament witness to the inability of fallen humanity to please God.
    - True freedom is lost when the will is turned away from God toward idols.
    - Only divine intervention can break the cycle of bondage and restore the will.
    - "The heart that worships idols becomes as spiritually lifeless as the idols themselves." (We Become What We Worship)

3. **Restoration of the Will through Union with Christ**
    - Redemption in Christ is necessary for the liberation and renewal of the will.
    - Union with Christ reorients the heart and mind toward God, enabling true obedience.
    - The Spirit’s work is essential in transforming desires and empowering new choices.
    - The new creation motif underscores the radical change in the believer’s will.
    - "It is only in Christ that the image of God is restored and the will set free." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

4. **Corporate and Cosmic Dimensions of Sin**
    - Sin and its effects are not merely individual but also communal and cosmic.
    - The biblical story traces the spread of idolatry and its consequences across nations and creation.
    - The restoration of free will is linked to the renewal of the entire cosmos in Christ.
    - The church is called to embody restored worship and freedom as a witness to the world.
    - "The church is the restored temple, a community freed from idolatry to serve the living God." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

5. **Scripture as the Norm for Understanding Sin and Freedom**
    - Beale grounds his theology of sin and free will in the storyline of Scripture.
    - Typology and intertextuality reveal the depth of human bondage and the promise of liberation.
    - The authority of Scripture is central for diagnosing the problem and prescribing the solution.
    - Biblical theology provides the framework for understanding the transformation of the will.
    - "The Bible’s story is one of God’s relentless pursuit to free his people from the bondage of sin and idolatry." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Gregory K. Beale has significantly shaped contemporary **biblical theology**, especially in understanding the dynamics of **sin** and **free will** through the motif of idolatry. His work has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to the doctrine of sin, emphasizing the transformative power of union with Christ.
