# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated a robustly **Augustinian** understanding of **sin** and **free will**, emphasizing the pervasive effects of **original sin** and the consequent **bondage of the will**. He maintained that human freedom is real but fundamentally limited by the **corruption of human nature**, making true spiritual good impossible apart from **divine grace**.

- "The inability which the Scriptures attribute to sinful man is not an inability to exercise volitions, but an inability to will good." ("The Plan of Salvation")

## Key Works

- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Human Side of Salvation"
- "Calvin and Augustine"
- "Perfectionism"
- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Original Sin**
    - Humanity is radically corrupted in every aspect by **original sin**.
    - This depravity is inherited from Adam and affects both will and intellect.
    - Sin is not merely a matter of acts, but a condition of the heart.
    - All human faculties are tainted, rendering people unable to choose God unaided.
    - "The race sinned in Adam, and in Adam fell under condemnation and corruption." ("The Plan of Salvation")

2. **Bondage of the Will**
    - The will is not free in the sense of moral or spiritual neutrality.
    - Human choices are determined by the nature, which is enslaved to sin.
    - True freedom is the ability to choose the good, which sinners lack.
    - Only **regenerating grace** can liberate the will from its bondage.
    - "The sinner is free to do what he wills, but he wills only evil." ("The Plan of Salvation")

3. **Necessity of Divine Grace**
    - Salvation is initiated and accomplished by **sovereign grace** alone.
    - No one can turn to God apart from the **effectual calling** of the Spirit.
    - Grace does not violate the will but renews and enables it.
    - Regeneration precedes faith and repentance in the ordo salutis.
    - "It is God who makes the sinner willing in the day of His power." ("The Plan of Salvation")

4. **Compatibilism: Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God’s sovereignty is fully compatible with genuine human agency.
    - Human choices are real and morally significant, though always under divine providence.
    - The will acts according to its strongest inclination, shaped by nature and circumstance.
    - Divine predestination does not coerce but ensures the certainty of salvation.
    - "God’s grace is not an external force but works through the renewed will itself." ("The Plan of Salvation")

5. **Rejection of Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian Views**
    - Warfield strongly opposed any notion of an unaffected or autonomous will.
    - He critiqued **Pelagianism** and **Arminianism** for undermining the seriousness of sin.
    - Human cooperation in salvation is itself a result of grace, not a precondition.
    - Any doctrine that diminishes the necessity of grace is fundamentally flawed.
    - "The difference between Calvinism and all other systems is the difference between monergism and synergism." ("Calvin and Augustine")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **total depravity** and the **bondage of the will** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology in the modern era, especially in debates over **Calvinism** and **Arminianism**. His rigorous defense of **Augustinian anthropology** continues to influence discussions on the nature of human freedom and the necessity of grace. Warfield’s work remains a touchstone for those defending the Reformed doctrine of sin and the absolute dependence of salvation on divine initiative.
