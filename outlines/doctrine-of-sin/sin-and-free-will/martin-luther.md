# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of **sin and free will** is marked by a strong emphasis on the pervasive bondage of the human will due to **original sin**. He contends that after the Fall, human beings are utterly incapable of turning to God or choosing good apart from **divine grace**, making salvation entirely dependent on **God’s sovereign initiative**.

- "Free will, after the fall, exists in name only, and as long as it does what it is able to do, it commits a mortal sin." ("The Bondage of the Will")

## Key Works

- The Bondage of the Will (De Servo Arbitrio)
- Lectures on Romans
- Heidelberg Disputation
- Small Catechism
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Galatians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Bondage of the Will**
    - Humanity’s will is enslaved to **sin** after the Fall.
    - No one can choose God or do true good without **regenerating grace**.
    - The will is not merely weakened but is in bondage, incapable of spiritual self-repair.
    - This bondage is a result of **original sin** inherited from Adam.
    - "Man is like a horse. Does God ride him, he wills and goes where God will; does Satan ride, he wills and goes where Satan will." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Denial of Free Will in Spiritual Matters**
    - Free will is a “mere name” in matters pertaining to salvation.
    - Human choices are bound by sinful inclinations and cannot attain righteousness.
    - True freedom is only possible through the **work of the Holy Spirit**.
    - Any claim to autonomous free will undermines the necessity of **grace**.
    - "Free will without God’s grace is not free at all, but is the permanent prisoner and bondslave of evil." (The Bondage of the Will)

3. **Necessity and Priority of Divine Grace**
    - Salvation is initiated and completed by **God’s grace alone**.
    - Human cooperation is excluded from the process of justification.
    - Grace is not a supplement to human effort but the sole cause of spiritual renewal.
    - The **Word of God** is the means by which grace is imparted and the will is liberated.
    - "It is not in our power to think well or do well, but everything that happens, happens by necessity." (The Bondage of the Will)

4. **Polemic Against Erasmus and Humanism**
    - Luther’s doctrine was articulated in direct opposition to Erasmus’s defense of free will.
    - He saw the affirmation of free will as a threat to the **doctrine of justification by faith alone**.
    - The controversy highlighted the incompatibility of humanistic optimism with biblical anthropology.
    - Luther insisted that only a theology of the cross, not of glory, could account for the depth of human sin.
    - "Your thoughts of God are too human." (The Bondage of the Will)

5. **Christocentric Anthropology**
    - True human freedom is found only in union with **Christ**.
    - The believer’s will is liberated through faith, not autonomous effort.
    - Christ’s righteousness is imputed, not infused, to the believer.
    - The transformation of the will is a result of being made new in Christ, not a precondition for grace.
    - "A Christian man is the freest lord of all, and subject to none; a Christian man is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to every one." (The Freedom of a Christian)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s teaching on **sin and free will** became foundational for the Protestant understanding of **human depravity** and the absolute necessity of **grace**. His polemic against the notion of autonomous free will shaped subsequent Reformation theology, especially in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions. The radical nature of his anthropology continues to inform debates on human agency, responsibility, and the nature of salvation. Luther’s insistence on the primacy of grace remains a defining feature of evangelical soteriology.
