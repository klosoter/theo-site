# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **sin** and **free will** through the lens of existential interpretation, emphasizing the individual's confrontation with **authentic existence** and **alienation from God**. He rejected traditional metaphysical accounts of **original sin** and **human nature**, instead interpreting sin as a state of inauthenticity and estrangement, and free will as the existential decision to respond to the **kerygma** of the gospel.

- "Sin is not a substance but an event, the event of man's estrangement from himself and from God." ("Theology of the New Testament")

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "Existence and Faith" (1960)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Existential Estrangement**
    - Sin is not a hereditary condition but an existential reality experienced in alienation from God.
    - It is defined by inauthentic existence, where individuals fail to live in openness to God's call.
    - Bultmann interprets biblical language about sin mythologically, focusing on its existential significance.
    - Sin is the refusal to accept one's finitude and dependence on God.
    - "Sin is the self-contradiction of man, who wants to secure his own life and thus loses it." ("Theology of the New Testament")

2. **Demythologizing Original Sin**
    - Bultmann rejects the literal doctrine of original sin as a mythological construct.
    - He seeks to reinterpret biblical teaching in existential categories relevant to modern people.
    - The Adam narrative is seen as a symbol of universal human estrangement, not a historical event.
    - Sin is universal, but not because of biological inheritance; it is the existential condition of all.
    - "The mythological view of original sin must be translated into existential understanding." ("New Testament and Mythology")

3. **Freedom as Decision in Encounter**
    - Free will is not autonomous self-determination but the capacity to respond to God's address.
    - Authentic freedom arises in the existential decision to accept or reject the call of the gospel.
    - Human will is bound in inauthenticity until liberated by faith.
    - The encounter with the kerygma creates the possibility of genuine decision.
    - "Freedom is not a property of man, but a possibility opened up by the word of God." ("Existence and Faith")

4. **Faith as Response to the Kerygma**
    - Faith is an existential act, not intellectual assent or moral achievement.
    - It is the acceptance of God's grace in the proclamation of Christ.
    - Faith liberates from the bondage of sin and inauthentic existence.
    - The decision of faith is the true exercise of freedom.
    - "Faith is the surrender of the self to the word which addresses man here and now." ("Faith and Understanding")

5. **Rejection of Metaphysical Anthropology**
    - Bultmann denies any fixed metaphysical essence of human nature.
    - He interprets biblical anthropology through existential philosophy, especially Heidegger.
    - Human beings are defined by their decisions and relationships, not by substance.
    - Sin and freedom are existential realities, not ontological states.
    - "Man does not possess a nature; he is what he decides to be in the moment of decision." ("Theology of the New Testament")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's existential interpretation of **sin** and **free will** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **demythologization** and hermeneutics. His approach challenged traditional doctrines by reframing them in existential terms, influencing both Protestant theology and New Testament studies. While his rejection of metaphysical categories has been controversial, his focus on the individual's encounter with the gospel remains a significant contribution to modern theological thought.
