# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a nuanced account of **sin** and **free will** within the framework of **scholastic theology**. He affirmed that human beings possess genuine **free choice** (liberum arbitrium) even after the **Fall**, though this freedom is wounded and inclined toward **concupiscence**. For Aquinas, **original sin** corrupts human nature but does not annihilate the capacity for voluntary action.

- "Man has free-will: otherwise counsels, exhortations, commands, prohibitions, rewards, and punishments would be in vain." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.83, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I-II, Q.6–21, Q.71–89)
- Summa Contra Gentiles (Book III, chs. 111–113)
- De Malo
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard (Book II, Distinction 24)
- Aquinas on Human Action: A Theory of Practice (secondary, Steven J. Jensen)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Free Will as Rational Appetite**
   - Free will is rooted in the **rational soul** and the capacity to deliberate.
   - Human beings can choose between alternatives because of their intellect and will.
   - Free will is not destroyed by sin, but its orientation toward the good is weakened.
   - Divine grace does not override but heals and elevates free will.
   - "Free-will is nothing else than the power of the reason and will to choose good and evil." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.83, a.2)

2. **Original Sin and Its Effects**
   - **Original sin** is transmitted by propagation, not imitation.
   - It causes a privation of original righteousness, disordering the faculties.
   - The will remains free, but is now inclined toward evil (concupiscence).
   - Actual sins flow from this disordered state.
   - "By original sin the nature is deprived of original justice, and all its powers are disordered." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.82, a.3)

3. **Distinction Between Mortal and Venial Sin**
   - Mortal sin destroys **charity** and severs the soul from God.
   - Venial sin wounds but does not break the relationship with God.
   - The gravity of sin depends on the object, intention, and circumstances.
   - Free will is involved in both types, but with differing consequences.
   - "Mortal sin is so called because it destroys the spiritual life which is the effect of charity." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.88, a.1)

4. **Necessity of Grace for Good Acts**
   - After the Fall, humans cannot perform **supernaturally good acts** without grace.
   - Grace heals the will and enables true merit.
   - Even the first movement toward God requires prevenient grace.
   - Free will cooperates with, but does not initiate, saving action.
   - "Without grace, man cannot prepare himself for the light of grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.109, a.6)

5. **Divine Providence and Human Freedom**
   - God's **providence** governs all things, including human choices.
   - Divine causality does not negate but grounds secondary causes, including free will.
   - God moves the will infallibly, yet without coercion.
   - Human responsibility is preserved within the order of divine sovereignty.
   - "God moves man's will, as the universal mover moves all things, but so as not to destroy the liberty of the will." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.83, a.1, ad 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **free will** and **original sin** became foundational for later Western theology, especially in the Roman Catholic tradition. His careful distinction between nature and grace influenced both medieval and Reformation debates. The Thomistic account of **concupiscence**, **mortal and venial sin**, and the necessity of grace remains a touchstone for discussions of human responsibility and divine sovereignty. Aquinas’s thought continues to shape contemporary conversations on the compatibility of **divine providence** and genuine human freedom.
