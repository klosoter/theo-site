# Anthony Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony Hoekema approached **sin** and **free will** from a distinctly **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the pervasive effects of **original sin** and the resulting **bondage of the will**. He maintained that, after the Fall, human freedom is real but fundamentally limited by the corruption of human nature, making true spiritual good impossible apart from **regenerating grace**.

- "Because of the fall, man is no longer able to do any spiritual good; his will is enslaved to sin." (Created in God's Image)

## Key Works

- Created in God's Image (1986)
- The Four Major Cults (1963)
- Saved by Grace (1989)
- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- "Total Depravity" in The Five Points of Calvinism (various editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and the Bondage of the Will**
    - Humanity's entire being, including the will, is corrupted by **original sin**.
    - The will is not destroyed but is enslaved, unable to choose God apart from grace.
    - Sin affects every aspect of human nature, making self-salvation impossible.
    - True freedom is only restored through **regeneration**.
    - "The will is not free in the sense that it can choose the good apart from the work of the Holy Spirit." (Created in God's Image)

2. **Distinction Between Natural and Moral Ability**
    - Humans retain natural faculties of choice and decision-making.
    - Moral ability—the capacity to choose spiritual good—is lost due to sin.
    - This distinction preserves human responsibility while affirming total depravity.
    - The inability to do good is ethical, not metaphysical.
    - "Man is still able to make choices, but he is not able to choose what is truly good in God's sight." (Created in God's Image)

3. **Original Sin as the Root of Human Bondage**
    - All people inherit a sinful nature from Adam.
    - This inherited corruption is the source of all actual sins.
    - Original sin explains the universality and inevitability of human sinfulness.
    - The doctrine underscores the need for **divine grace**.
    - "Original sin is not just a tendency to sin, but a radical corruption of our entire nature." (Created in God's Image)

4. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
    - Only the **Holy Spirit** can liberate the will from its bondage.
    - Regeneration precedes faith and repentance, enabling a true response to God.
    - Salvation is entirely of grace, not of human initiative.
    - The new birth restores the capacity for spiritual obedience.
    - "It is only through the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit that man is enabled to will and to do what is pleasing to God." (Saved by Grace)

5. **Human Responsibility and Divine Sovereignty**
    - Despite bondage to sin, humans remain accountable for their choices.
    - Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are compatible, not contradictory.
    - The call to repentance and faith is genuine and universal.
    - The mystery of God's sovereignty does not negate moral accountability.
    - "Though man is totally depraved, he is still responsible for his actions before God." (Created in God's Image)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema's articulation of **sin** and **free will** has shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology, especially in evangelical circles. His clear distinction between natural and moral ability has helped clarify debates on human responsibility and divine grace. By emphasizing the necessity of **regeneration** and the reality of human accountability, Hoekema provided a robust theological framework that continues to inform discussions on salvation, sanctification, and the human condition.
