# Richard Muller (1948–)

Richard Muller is a leading historian of **Reformed orthodoxy**, whose scholarship clarifies the nuanced positions of early modern theologians on **sin** and **free will**. He demonstrates that the Reformed tradition, far from advocating a simplistic determinism, carefully articulated the relationship between **original sin**, **human depravity**, and the persistence of **created freedom** within the bounds of **divine sovereignty**.

- "The Reformed orthodox did not deny the reality of human choice, but rather argued that the will is bound by the nature of the fallen person." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Holy Scripture
- "The Bondage and Liberation of the Will in the Reformed Tradition" (in After Calvin)
- Calvin and the Reformed Tradition: On the Work of Christ and the Order of Salvation
- Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Corruption of Nature**
    - Sin is not merely a series of acts but a **corruption of human nature** inherited from Adam.
    - This corruption affects the **intellect, will, and affections**, rendering humanity unable to choose spiritual good apart from grace.
    - The Reformed tradition distinguishes between the **guilt** and the **pollution** of sin.
    - Original sin is propagated by natural generation, not by imitation alone.
    - "Sin is both a privation of original righteousness and a positive inclination toward evil." (PRRD, vol. 3)

2. **Free Will Post-Fall: Servitude to Sin**
    - After the Fall, human will remains **free in the sense of voluntary choice**, but is enslaved to sinful desires.
    - The will is not coerced by God or external forces, but is internally bound by its own depraved nature.
    - The Reformed orthodox distinguish between **necessity of coercion** and **necessity of immutability**.
    - Fallen humanity retains natural liberty but has lost spiritual liberty.
    - "The will is not destroyed by sin, but its freedom is confined within the limits of its fallen condition." (PRRD, vol. 3)

3. **Distinction Between Types of Freedom**
    - Muller highlights the scholastic distinction between **libertas naturae** (natural liberty) and **libertas gratiae** (liberty of grace).
    - Natural liberty refers to the faculty of willing, which persists after the Fall.
    - Liberty of grace is the restored ability to will spiritual good, granted only through regeneration.
    - The Reformed tradition rejects Pelagian and semi-Pelagian views of autonomous free will.
    - "Reformed theologians carefully distinguished between the faculties of the will and the moral ability to use them rightly." (After Calvin)

4. **Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God's **sovereignty** is fully compatible with genuine human responsibility.
    - Divine concurrence does not override or negate the reality of human choices.
    - The Reformed view upholds **compatibilism**: human actions are both free (voluntary) and determined (by nature and providence).
    - Sinful acts are truly willed by humans, even as they fall within God's eternal decree.
    - "The Reformed orthodox maintained that divine predestination does not violate the integrity of secondary causes, including the human will." (PRRD, vol. 3)

5. **Role of Grace in Liberation of the Will**
    - Only **effectual grace** can liberate the will from bondage to sin.
    - Regeneration restores the will’s capacity to choose spiritual good.
    - The process of sanctification involves the gradual renewal of the will and affections.
    - The Reformed tradition insists on the necessity and priority of **divine initiative** in salvation.
    - "Grace does not destroy the will but heals and elevates it, enabling true freedom in Christ." (Calvin and the Reformed Tradition)

## Legacy and Impact

Muller's scholarship has profoundly shaped contemporary understanding of **Reformed anthropology** and the doctrine of **free will**. By recovering the scholastic distinctions and careful formulations of early modern theologians, he has corrected widespread misconceptions about Reformed determinism and clarified the tradition’s nuanced approach to **sin** and **human agency**. His work remains foundational for students and scholars seeking to grasp the historical and theological depth of the Reformed view on these loci.
