# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached **sin** and **free will** through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the significance of the **covenant of works** and the **federal headship** of Adam. He argued that human freedom is always exercised within the boundaries of God's sovereign decree, and that the fall into sin resulted in the loss of true moral liberty, leaving humanity in a state of **bondage to sin** apart from redemptive grace.

- "Man’s freedom is not autonomy but the liberty of willing and acting within the limits set by the Creator’s covenantal order." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Images of the Spirit
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos
- Structure of Biblical Authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Covenant Violation**
    - Sin is fundamentally a breach of the **covenant of works** established with Adam.
    - The original act of disobedience brought all humanity under the curse of the covenant.
    - Sin is not merely individual acts but a corporate, federal reality.
    - The consequences of Adam’s sin are imputed to all his descendants.
    - "The fall was a covenantal event, not simply a personal failure." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Federal Headship and Original Sin**
    - Adam acted as the federal representative of humanity in the covenant of works.
    - Adam’s disobedience resulted in the judicial condemnation of all his posterity.
    - Original sin is transmitted by imputation, not by imitation.
    - The federal structure underscores the corporate dimension of both sin and redemption.
    - "The principle of federal representation is basic to the biblical doctrine of sin and salvation." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Bondage of the Will After the Fall**
    - After the fall, human will is enslaved to sin and incapable of true spiritual good.
    - The loss of original righteousness means the will is no longer free in the moral sense.
    - Only divine grace can liberate the will from its bondage.
    - The unregenerate can make choices, but not those pleasing to God.
    - "Freedom, in the biblical sense, is lost when man becomes a slave to sin." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God’s sovereign decree encompasses all human actions, including sin.
    - Human responsibility is upheld within the framework of God’s providence.
    - There is no contradiction between divine sovereignty and genuine human agency.
    - The covenant structure provides the context for understanding accountability.
    - "The Creator’s sovereignty does not negate but rather establishes the reality of human responsibility." (Structure of Biblical Authority)

5. **Redemptive Restoration of True Freedom**
    - Redemption in Christ restores the liberty lost in Adam.
    - The new covenant grants the Spirit, enabling true obedience and freedom.
    - Justification and sanctification address both the guilt and power of sin.
    - Eschatological fulfillment will bring perfect freedom from sin’s presence.
    - "The liberty of the sons of God is the fruit of covenantal redemption." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal approach to **sin** and **free will** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in its articulation of the **covenant of works** and federal headship. His nuanced understanding of human agency under divine sovereignty has influenced debates on the nature of moral responsibility and the effects of the fall. Kline’s work continues to inform discussions on biblical anthropology and the structure of redemptive history within the Reformed tradition.
