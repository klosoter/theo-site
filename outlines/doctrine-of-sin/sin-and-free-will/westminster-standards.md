# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **original sin** and the **bondage of the will** after the Fall, emphasizing humanity’s total inability to choose spiritual good apart from **regenerating grace**. While affirming that humans retain **natural liberty** and are not forced by God to sin, the Standards insist that the will is enslaved to sin until set free by **effectual calling**. This framework upholds both the seriousness of human depravity and the necessity of divine initiative in salvation.

- "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation." (Westminster Confession of Faith 9.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 6, 9, and 10)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 21–29)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 13–19)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine
- Chad Van Dixhoorn, Confessing the Faith: A Reader’s Guide to the Westminster Confession of Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Original Sin**
   - Humanity’s nature is thoroughly corrupted by **Adam’s first transgression**.
   - All people are born under the guilt and pollution of original sin.
   - This corruption extends to the mind, will, and affections.
   - No one is able to do any spiritual good without God’s grace.
   - "From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil, do proceed all actual transgressions." (WCF 6.4)

2. **Bondage of the Will**
   - After the Fall, the human will is not free to choose spiritual good.
   - The will is inclined only toward sin until renewed by the Holy Spirit.
   - Fallen humans act voluntarily, but always according to their sinful nature.
   - True freedom is restored only in **regeneration**.
   - "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation." (WCF 9.3)

3. **Natural Liberty Preserved**
   - God does not force or coerce the human will.
   - Humans retain the faculty of will and make real choices.
   - The will is determined by the moral nature of the person.
   - Responsibility for sin remains, even in inability.
   - "God hath endued the will of man with that natural liberty, that it is neither forced, nor by any absolute necessity of nature determined to good or evil." (WCF 9.1)

4. **Necessity of Effectual Calling**
   - Only the **effectual call** of the Spirit can free the will from bondage.
   - God sovereignly renews the will, enabling the sinner to respond in faith.
   - This work is monergistic, not synergistic.
   - The response of faith is both enabled and required.
   - "All those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those only, he is pleased, in his appointed and accepted time, effectually to call, by his Word and Spirit, out of that state of sin and death, in which they are by nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ." (WCF 10.1)

5. **Liberty of the Will in Glory**
   - In the state of glory, the will is perfectly and immutably free to do good alone.
   - The redeemed are no longer able to sin.
   - This is the consummation of true liberty.
   - The will’s freedom is perfected, not abolished.
   - "The will of man is made perfectly and immutably free to do good alone in the state of glory only." (WCF 9.5)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on sin and free will, providing a systematic and nuanced account that balances human responsibility with divine sovereignty. Their articulation of **total depravity** and the necessity of **effectual calling** remains foundational for Presbyterian and broader Reformed traditions. The Standards continue to serve as a touchstone for doctrinal clarity and confessional identity in discussions of human nature, sin, and salvation.
