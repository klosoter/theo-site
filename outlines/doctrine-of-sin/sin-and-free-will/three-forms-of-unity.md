# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robustly **Reformed doctrine of sin and free will**. They emphasize the pervasive corruption of **original sin**, the bondage of the human will after the Fall, and the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation, rejecting any notion of autonomous human ability to choose God apart from regeneration. These confessions uphold the **total depravity** of humanity and the **sovereign initiative of God** in redemption.

- "Therefore, all people are conceived in sin and are born children of wrath, unfit for any saving good, inclined to evil, dead in their sins, and slaves to sin." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.3)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 14–16
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 5, 8, 53, 114–115
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads III/IV
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard collected edition)
- Lyle D. Bierma, The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Original Sin**
    - Humanity is fallen in Adam and inherits a corrupt nature.
    - All faculties, including the will, are affected by sin.
    - People are incapable of any spiritual good apart from grace.
    - Sin is not merely an act but a pervasive condition.
    - "We believe that through the disobedience of Adam original sin has been spread through the whole human race." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

2. **Bondage of the Will**
    - After the Fall, the human will is enslaved to sin.
    - Free will is not abolished in the sense of coercion, but is morally bound.
    - The unregenerate cannot turn to God or choose spiritual good.
    - True freedom is only restored by the Holy Spirit.
    - "Without the grace of the regenerating Holy Spirit, they are neither willing nor able to return to God." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.3)

3. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
    - Regeneration is essential for any movement toward God.
    - Grace is not merely assistance but effectual transformation.
    - The Spirit renews the will, enabling faith and repentance.
    - Salvation is wholly initiated by God, not by human effort.
    - "Regeneration is a supernatural work...infused into the heart by the Holy Spirit." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.12)

4. **Rejection of Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism**
    - Denies that humans can cooperate with grace prior to regeneration.
    - Affirms that faith itself is a gift, not a human contribution.
    - Opposes any doctrine that attributes the decisive cause of salvation to the human will.
    - Upholds monergism in conversion and perseverance.
    - "Therefore, all people are conceived in sin and are born children of wrath, unfit for any saving good, inclined to evil, dead in their sins, and slaves to sin." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.3)

5. **Responsibility and Guilt**
    - Despite inability, humans remain responsible for sin.
    - Guilt is imputed from Adam and incurred by actual transgressions.
    - The law exposes sin and drives to Christ, but cannot save.
    - The call to repentance is genuine, even though only the elect respond.
    - "God created man good and in His own image...but man, by the instigation of the devil...deprived himself of these excellent gifts." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of **sin and free will**, setting clear boundaries against both Roman Catholic synergism and Arminianism. Their articulation of **total depravity** and the necessity of sovereign grace remains foundational in confessional Reformed churches worldwide. These documents continue to serve as authoritative standards for doctrine, catechesis, and ecclesiastical discipline, ensuring continuity in the Reformed tradition’s soteriology.
