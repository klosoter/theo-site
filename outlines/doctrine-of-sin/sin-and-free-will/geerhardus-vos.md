# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated a robustly **Reformed doctrine of sin** and **free will**, emphasizing the radical corruption of human nature after the Fall and the consequent bondage of the will. He maintained that **original sin** renders humanity incapable of choosing true spiritual good apart from **regenerating grace**, situating human freedom within the broader context of **divine sovereignty** and **federal headship**.

- "The will is not free in the sense that it can choose the good apart from the renewing grace of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology"
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Love of God" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Bondage of the Will**
    - Humanity's will is radically corrupted by **original sin**.
    - After the Fall, the will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose spiritual good.
    - The inability is moral, not natural; humans remain responsible.
    - Only **regenerating grace** can liberate the will for true obedience.
    - "Sin has not destroyed the faculties of man, but it has made him incapable of using them aright." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** for humanity in the covenant of works.
    - Adam’s sin is imputed to all his descendants, affecting their will and nature.
    - The transmission of guilt and corruption is both legal and existential.
    - Christ, as the second Adam, restores what was lost in the Fall.
    - "The imputation of Adam’s sin is inseparable from the corruption of nature." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Distinction Between Natural and Moral Ability**
    - Humans retain natural faculties of will and reason after the Fall.
    - Moral ability to choose God is lost due to sin’s corruption.
    - The distinction preserves human responsibility while affirming inability.
    - Regeneration restores moral ability without violating the will’s nature.
    - "Man is not compelled by God to sin, but left to the evil inclination of his own heart." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

4. **Necessity of Divine Grace for True Freedom**
    - True spiritual freedom is only possible through **effectual calling** and **regeneration**.
    - Grace does not coerce but renews the will, enabling faith and repentance.
    - The Spirit’s work is both sovereign and congruent with human faculties.
    - Salvation is monergistic, not synergistic.
    - "Grace does not destroy the will, but makes it truly free for the first time." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

5. **Sin as Both Guilt and Pollution**
    - Sin involves both legal guilt before God and inward corruption.
    - The will is polluted, inclining always toward evil apart from grace.
    - Both aspects are remedied in Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The doctrine safeguards the necessity of both justification and sanctification.
    - "Sin is not merely an act, but a state of the heart and will." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **total depravity** and the bondage of the will has profoundly shaped Reformed anthropology and soteriology, reinforcing the necessity of sovereign grace for salvation. His careful distinction between natural and moral ability has provided clarity in debates over human responsibility and divine sovereignty. Vos’s covenantal framework continues to influence discussions on **original sin**, free will, and the work of Christ as the second Adam. His legacy endures in both academic and ecclesiastical contexts, especially among confessional Reformed theologians.
