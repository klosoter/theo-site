# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **sin and free will** through the lens of **Reformed anthropology** and **presuppositional apologetics**, emphasizing the radical effects of the **fall** on human nature and the necessity of **divine sovereignty**. He argued that human **freedom** must always be understood as **creaturely** and thus dependent, never autonomous, and that **sin** is fundamentally ethical rebellion against God’s authority.

- "The essence of sin consists in man’s revolt against the authority of God." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Christian Apologetics
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- A Survey of Christian Epistemology
- Common Grace and the Gospel

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Ethical Antithesis**
    - Sin is not merely a lack or privation but an active ethical opposition to God.
    - The fall introduced a radical antithesis between the regenerate and unregenerate mind.
    - Sin affects the whole person, including intellect, will, and affections.
    - The noetic effects of sin distort all human reasoning apart from grace.
    - "Sin is ethical in nature and involves the whole man in opposition to God." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Creaturely Free Will**
    - Human freedom is always derivative and never autonomous.
    - True freedom is found in obedience to God, not independence from Him.
    - The will is bound by the nature of the person—fallen or redeemed.
    - Autonomy is itself a sinful illusion and the root of rebellion.
    - "Man’s freedom is always the freedom of a creature and never that of a creator." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - The fall rendered humanity totally depraved, affecting every faculty.
    - Apart from grace, humans are unable to choose God or do true good.
    - Free will, in the libertarian sense, is denied; the will is enslaved to sin.
    - Regeneration is necessary for any movement toward God.
    - "The natural man is dead in trespasses and sins and cannot of himself turn to God." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God’s sovereignty is exhaustive and governs all human actions.
    - Human responsibility is upheld within the framework of divine decree.
    - There is a genuine sense in which humans make real choices, though always under God’s providence.
    - The mystery of compatibilism is maintained rather than resolved.
    - "God’s counsel determines whatsoever comes to pass, yet man is fully responsible." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Presuppositional Apologetics and the Problem of Sin**
    - Unbelievers interpret reality from sinful presuppositions, suppressing the truth.
    - Apologetics must challenge the autonomy of sinful reason, not merely present evidence.
    - The antithesis between belief and unbelief is rooted in the ethical rebellion of sin.
    - Only the Holy Spirit can overcome the sinful will’s resistance to God.
    - "The natural man will always interpret facts in terms of his own false principle of autonomy." (A Survey of Christian Epistemology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **sin and free will** has profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and theology, especially through his emphasis on the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief. His insistence on the radical effects of sin and the necessity of divine grace has influenced generations of theologians and apologists. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing debates over the nature of human freedom, the noetic effects of sin, and the proper method of defending the faith.
