# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **sin** and **free will** through the lens of **historical revelation** and **eschatological anthropology**, emphasizing the relational and communal dimensions of human existence. He argued that **human freedom** is always exercised within the context of **God’s self-revelation** and that **sin** is fundamentally a rupture in the relationship between humanity and God, manifesting as self-assertion against divine lordship.

- "Sin is the self-contradiction of man, who, in his self-assertion, denies his dependence on God." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology," Volumes 1–3
- "Anthropology in Theological Perspective"
- "Jesus—God and Man"
- "Basic Questions in Theology," Volumes 1–3

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Relational Rupture**
   - Sin is not merely a violation of law but a disruption of the relationship between humanity and God.
   - It is rooted in the self-centered assertion of autonomy over against God’s claim.
   - Sin manifests in alienation from both God and fellow humans.
   - The universality of sin is tied to the universal condition of estrangement from God.
   - "Sin is the breaking of the relationship with God, which is the basis of all other relationships." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

2. **Freedom as Response to Revelation**
   - Human freedom is actualized in response to God’s self-revelation in history.
   - True freedom is not autonomy but participation in the divine purpose.
   - Freedom is eschatologically oriented, fulfilled in the consummation of God’s kingdom.
   - The misuse of freedom is the root of sin, as it resists God’s call.
   - "Freedom is realized only in the openness to God’s future." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

3. **Eschatological Anthropology**
   - Human nature and freedom are defined by their orientation toward the future fulfillment in God.
   - Sin is a distortion of this orientation, turning humanity inward.
   - Anthropology must be understood in light of Christ’s resurrection as the revelation of true humanity.
   - The restoration of freedom is linked to participation in Christ.
   - "Man’s true being is determined by his future in God." ("Anthropology in Theological Perspective")

4. **Universality and Historicity of Sin**
   - Sin is a universal human condition, not merely individual acts.
   - The historical development of humanity reveals the pervasive reality of sin.
   - The universality of sin is illuminated in the light of Christ’s redemptive work.
   - Human history is the arena in which both sin and redemption are revealed.
   - "The universality of sin is disclosed only in the light of the universal significance of Christ." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

5. **Christological Resolution of Sin and Freedom**
   - Jesus Christ embodies the true relationship between God and humanity.
   - In Christ, human freedom is restored and sin is overcome.
   - The resurrection is the decisive revelation of God’s victory over sin.
   - Participation in Christ enables the renewal of human freedom and community.
   - "In Christ, the contradiction of sin is overcome and freedom is given its true content." ("Jesus—God and Man")

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s integration of **historical revelation**, **eschatology**, and **anthropology** has significantly shaped contemporary discussions of sin and free will. His emphasis on the relational and communal nature of sin, as well as the eschatological fulfillment of human freedom, has influenced both Protestant and ecumenical theology. Pannenberg’s work continues to challenge theologians to consider the dynamic interplay between human agency, history, and divine revelation. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of **human freedom** and the universality of sin within the broader context of systematic theology.
