# Robert Letham (1947– )

Robert Letham approaches **sin** and **free will** from a robustly **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the pervasive effects of the **fall** on human nature and the resulting **bondage of the will**. He maintains that while humans retain a form of **natural liberty**, true spiritual freedom is only possible through **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit. Letham situates his views within the broader tradition of **Augustinian** and **Reformed orthodoxy**, stressing the necessity of divine grace for salvation.

- "Sin is not merely an act but a condition, a radical corruption of our entire being, affecting our will, mind, and affections." ("Systematic Theology", p. 394)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and the Bondage of the Will**
    - Humanity’s will is radically corrupted by **original sin**.
    - The fall results in an inability to choose spiritual good apart from grace.
    - Sin affects every faculty, including intellect, emotions, and volition.
    - The will is not destroyed but is enslaved to sinful desires.
    - "The will is not free in the sense of being able to choose God unaided; it is in bondage to sin." (Systematic Theology, p. 395)

2. **Natural Liberty and Moral Inability**
    - Humans retain natural liberty in making choices within their fallen nature.
    - Moral inability refers to the incapacity to will or do any spiritual good.
    - Letham distinguishes between freedom as spontaneity and freedom as moral power.
    - True freedom is the ability to serve God, which fallen humanity lacks.
    - "We are free in the sense of acting according to our desires, but our desires are enslaved to sin." (Systematic Theology, p. 396)

3. **Necessity of Regeneration**
    - Regeneration is essential for liberation from the bondage of sin.
    - The Holy Spirit alone can renew the will and enable faith.
    - Conversion is both a divine act and a human response, made possible by grace.
    - The new birth restores the capacity for true spiritual freedom.
    - "Only by the sovereign work of the Spirit can the will be set free to respond to God." (Systematic Theology, p. 397)

4. **Sin as Both Act and Condition**
    - Sin is not just individual acts but a pervasive condition of alienation from God.
    - The sinful condition precedes and produces sinful actions.
    - The depth of sin means that even good deeds are tainted apart from grace.
    - Letham affirms the **federal headship** of Adam in transmitting sin.
    - "Sin is a state as well as an act, a condition that shapes all we do." (Systematic Theology, p. 394)

5. **Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God’s sovereignty is compatible with genuine human responsibility.
    - Letham upholds **compatibilism**: God ordains all things, yet humans act freely within their nature.
    - The mystery of divine providence and human choice is maintained without contradiction.
    - Moral accountability remains, even in the context of fallen will.
    - "God’s sovereign purpose does not negate human responsibility; rather, it establishes it." (Systematic Theology, p. 398)

## Legacy and Impact

Letham’s articulation of **sin** and **free will** has reinforced a classical **Reformed** understanding within contemporary systematic theology. His careful engagement with both historical sources and modern challenges has made his work a standard reference for students and pastors alike. By emphasizing the necessity of **regeneration** and the seriousness of human depravity, Letham has contributed to ongoing discussions about the nature of human freedom and divine grace in salvation. His influence is particularly notable in Reformed seminaries and among those seeking a biblically grounded, confessional approach to anthropology.
