# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **sin** and **free will** through the lens of **existential estrangement** and **ontological freedom**. He saw sin not primarily as a moral failure but as a state of **alienation** from one's true being and from God, rooted in the human condition. For Tillich, **freedom** is both the capacity for self-transcendence and the anxiety-laden possibility of separation from the **Ground of Being**.

- "Sin is separation. To be in the state of sin is to be in the state of separation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially sections on sin and human nature)
- The Courage to Be
- The Shaking of the Foundations (sermons on estrangement and reconciliation)
- Dynamics of Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Existential Estrangement**
    - Sin is fundamentally a state of **separation** from God, others, and oneself.
    - This estrangement is existential, not merely ethical or legal.
    - It manifests as alienation, loneliness, and meaninglessness.
    - Sin is universal, affecting the entire structure of human existence.
    - "Sin is the separation of man from the ground of his being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Freedom as Ontological Structure**
    - Human beings possess an inherent **freedom** rooted in their being.
    - This freedom is the capacity to transcend given situations and make choices.
    - Freedom is inseparable from **finitude** and the anxiety it produces.
    - The misuse of freedom leads to estrangement and sin.
    - "Man is free in that he can separate himself from his essential being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Sin as Unavoidable and Universal**
    - Sin is not a series of discrete acts but a universal condition.
    - All humans are inevitably caught in estrangement due to their existential situation.
    - This universality is not inherited guilt but an ontological reality.
    - The doctrine of **original sin** is reinterpreted as the existential state of separation.
    - "The universality of sin is the universality of estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Ambiguity of Human Will**
    - The human will is both free and bound by the conditions of existence.
    - True freedom is distorted by anxiety, leading to self-contradiction.
    - The will cannot by itself overcome estrangement; it requires **grace**.
    - Human autonomy is always ambiguous, marked by both possibility and limitation.
    - "The will to be oneself is at the same time the will to be separated." (The Courage to Be)

5. **Reconciliation through Acceptance**
    - Overcoming sin requires acceptance of acceptance by the **Ground of Being**.
    - Reconciliation is not achieved by human effort but by receiving **grace**.
    - Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned and open to reunion with God.
    - The healing of estrangement is the restoration of unity with self, others, and God.
    - "You are accepted, accepted by that which is greater than you." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential interpretation of **sin** and **free will** has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the dialogue between theology and existential philosophy. His focus on **estrangement** and the ontological dimensions of freedom shifted the discussion from legalistic categories to questions of meaning, anxiety, and reconciliation. Tillich’s work continues to shape contemporary debates on the nature of human existence, the universality of sin, and the possibility of grace in a secular age.
