# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck addressed **sin** and **free will** within the framework of **Reformed anthropology**, emphasizing the pervasive corruption of human nature after the Fall and the resulting bondage of the will. He maintained that, although humans retain the faculty of will, their moral inability renders them incapable of true spiritual good apart from **regenerating grace**. Bavinck’s synthesis of **Augustinian** and **Reformed** thought upholds both human responsibility and the necessity of **divine sovereignty** in salvation.

- "Sin is not an essential part of man’s being, but it has penetrated so deeply into his nature that only God’s grace can deliver him from its power." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

- Philosophy of Revelation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and the Bondage of the Will**
   - Sin has corrupted every aspect of human nature, including the will.
   - Humans are incapable of choosing true spiritual good without divine intervention.
   - The will is free in its operations but bound in its moral direction post-Fall.
   - Bavinck draws on **Augustinian** and **Reformed** traditions to articulate this bondage.
   "The will remains free in a psychological sense, but it is enslaved in a moral sense." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

2. **Distinction Between Natural and Moral Ability**
   - Humans retain the natural faculties of intellect, emotion, and will.
   - Moral ability to do good is lost due to the corruption of sin.
   - This distinction preserves human responsibility while affirming **total depravity**.
   - Only **regenerating grace** restores moral ability.
   "Man is still man, but he is no longer good; he has lost the image of God in the narrower sense." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

3. **Original Sin and Its Transmission**
   - Adam’s first sin resulted in the corruption of all humanity.
   - Sin is transmitted both by imputation and by the propagation of a sinful nature.
   - All humans are born in a state of guilt and moral inability.
   - This doctrine undergirds the necessity of **redemption in Christ**.
   "Original sin is both guilt and pollution, imputed and inherent." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

4. **Human Responsibility and Divine Sovereignty**
   - Human beings remain responsible for their actions despite their inability.
   - **Divine sovereignty** does not negate genuine human agency.
   - God’s grace does not coerce but renews the will, enabling true freedom.
   - Bavinck affirms the mystery of compatibilism between sovereignty and responsibility.
   "Grace does not destroy nature but restores it to its true freedom." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

5. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
   - Only the **Holy Spirit** can liberate the will from the bondage of sin.
   - Regeneration precedes and enables any movement toward God.
   - Salvation is entirely of grace, excluding all human merit.
   - The new birth restores the will’s capacity for spiritual good.
   "Regeneration is the re-creation of the will, making it truly free for the first time." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced articulation of **sin** and **free will** has shaped modern **Reformed theology**, providing a robust alternative to both Pelagian and deterministic models. His careful distinction between natural and moral ability preserves the integrity of human responsibility while upholding the necessity of **sovereign grace**. Bavinck’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of anthropology, soteriology, and the doctrine of sin, especially within confessional Reformed circles. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a balanced and biblically grounded account of human freedom and depravity.
