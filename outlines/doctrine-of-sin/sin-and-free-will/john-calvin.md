# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of **sin and free will** is marked by a robust affirmation of **total depravity** and the bondage of the human will after the Fall. He insists that, apart from **divine grace**, the human will is enslaved to sin and incapable of choosing true good, yet he maintains human responsibility within the framework of **God’s sovereignty** and **predestination**.

- "For the will is so utterly vitiated and corrupted in every part as to produce nothing but evil of itself." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 2.2.26)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 1–5)
- Commentary on Romans (notably on Romans 5 and 7)
- Bondage and Liberation of the Will (trans. A.N.S. Lane)
- Sermons on Genesis (especially on the Fall)
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity of Human Nature**
    - After the Fall, every aspect of human nature is corrupted by **original sin**.
    - The will is not merely weakened but is in bondage to sin.
    - Humans are incapable of any spiritual good apart from grace.
    - Sin affects intellect, affections, and volition.
    - "Man by nature is enslaved to sin, so that his will cannot move toward good unless it is helped by grace." (Institutes 2.3.5)

2. **Bondage of the Will**
    - The human will is not free in spiritual matters post-Fall.
    - True freedom is only possible through the **regenerating work of the Holy Spirit**.
    - The will can choose among external goods but not spiritual good.
    - Calvin rejects the notion of an autonomous free will in salvation.
    - "Free will is not sufficient to enable man to do good works, unless he is assisted by grace." (Institutes 2.2.6)

3. **Necessity of Divine Grace**
    - Salvation and any movement toward God require **effectual grace**.
    - Grace is not merely cooperative but **monergistic**—God alone initiates and completes salvation.
    - Regeneration precedes faith and repentance.
    - Grace does not destroy the will but liberates it.
    - "It is God who works in us both to will and to do." (Institutes 2.3.6)

4. **Human Responsibility and Guilt**
    - Despite the bondage of the will, humans remain morally responsible.
    - Sin is voluntary and arises from the heart’s own desires.
    - Divine sovereignty does not negate human culpability.
    - Calvin upholds the justice of God in holding sinners accountable.
    - "Man sins of his own will, yet he is so enslaved by the yoke of sin that he cannot move toward righteousness." (Institutes 2.3.5)

5. **Predestination and Providence**
    - God’s eternal decree governs all things, including human choices.
    - Predestination is not based on foreseen faith or merit.
    - The reprobate are left in their sin, while the elect are graciously renewed.
    - Providence encompasses even the sinful acts of men, yet God remains unstained by sin.
    - "God’s providence so overrules all things that nothing happens without his counsel." (Institutes 1.16.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s teaching on **sin and free will** has profoundly shaped the **Reformed tradition**, especially the doctrines of **total depravity** and **irresistible grace**. His views provided the theological foundation for later confessional standards such as the Westminster Confession of Faith. Calvin’s careful balance of divine sovereignty and human responsibility continues to influence debates on the nature of freedom, moral accountability, and the necessity of grace in salvation. His legacy endures in both academic theology and the life of Reformed churches worldwide.
