# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, articulated a robust doctrine of **original sin** and a compatibilist view of **free will**. He maintained that human will is truly free in the sense of voluntary action, yet is always determined by the moral nature, which after the Fall is enslaved to sin. Hodge’s understanding of **total depravity** and the **bondage of the will** reflects his commitment to classic **Reformed anthropology**.

- "A free agent is one who acts as he wills; and the will is determined by the moral state of the mind." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (Chapters on Sin and Free Agency)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans (especially on Romans 5)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on anthropology and sin

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Imputed and Inherited**
   - Adam’s first sin is both the ground and cause of human depravity.
   - All humans are born with a corrupt nature and under condemnation.
   - **Imputation** of Adam’s guilt is central to Hodge’s doctrine.
   - The universality of sin is explained by both federal headship and natural generation.
   - "The sin of Adam, therefore, is the judicial ground of the condemnation of his race." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Total Depravity and Moral Inability**
   - Human nature is thoroughly corrupted in every faculty.
   - The will is free in its choices but always chooses according to its sinful disposition.
   - Moral inability means sinners cannot choose good apart from grace.
   - This inability is not a lack of natural powers but a result of a corrupted moral state.
   - "The inability of fallen man is not physical, but moral." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Compatibilist Free Will**
   - True freedom is acting according to one’s desires and inclinations.
   - The will is not independent of the moral nature but is its expression.
   - Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are compatible.
   - Regeneration is necessary to restore true moral freedom.
   - "The liberty of a moral agent consists in the power of self-determination according to the prevailing state of the affections and reason." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Necessity of Regenerating Grace**
   - Only the **Holy Spirit** can liberate the will from bondage to sin.
   - Regeneration precedes any truly good choice or act of faith.
   - Grace does not coerce but renews the moral nature, enabling true freedom.
   - Conversion is both a divine act and a conscious human response.
   - "Regeneration is the act of God, and not the act of the sinner." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Federal Headship and Representative Principle**
   - Adam acted as the federal head of humanity in the covenant of works.
   - His disobedience is legally and vitally connected to all his descendants.
   - The representative principle undergirds both condemnation in Adam and salvation in Christ.
   - This framework preserves both the justice of God and the unity of the human race.
   - "The principle of representation pervades the whole Scriptures." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **original sin** and **free will** shaped generations of Reformed theology, especially in the American context. His compatibilist approach provided a rigorous defense of human responsibility within the framework of divine sovereignty. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of **anthropology**, **soteriology**, and the doctrine of sin, particularly among confessional Reformed communities. His systematic clarity and commitment to biblical exegesis continue to inform evangelical scholarship.
