# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **sin and free will** is foundational for Western theology. He taught that **original sin** radically corrupts human nature, rendering the will enslaved and unable to choose true good apart from **divine grace**. For Augustine, true **freedom** is not mere autonomy but the ability to love and serve God, which is only restored through **regeneration**.

- "For the will, when it was made perverse by sin, was made also weak." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- On the Free Choice of the Will (De Libero Arbitrio)
- On Nature and Grace (De Natura et Gratia)
- On the Spirit and the Letter (De Spiritu et Littera)
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin Corrupts the Will**
    - Humanity inherits a sinful nature from Adam, affecting every aspect of the person.
    - The will is not destroyed but is fundamentally disordered and inclined toward evil.
    - All people are born unable to choose God or true righteousness without grace.
    - Sin is both a condition and an act, rooted in the corrupted will.
    - "By the evil use of free will, man destroyed both it and himself." (On Free Choice of the Will)

2. **Grace is Absolutely Necessary**
    - Divine grace alone can heal and liberate the will from its bondage to sin.
    - Grace is not merely external help but an inward transformation by the Holy Spirit.
    - No one can even begin to will the good apart from prevenient grace.
    - Salvation is entirely a work of God’s mercy, not human initiative.
    - "Without God’s grace, man can neither will nor do anything good." (On Nature and Grace)

3. **Freedom is the Power to Do Good**
    - True freedom is not the ability to choose any option, but the capacity to love and obey God.
    - In the state of sin, humans are not truly free but are slaves to sinful desires.
    - Regeneration restores the will’s ability to choose the good.
    - Perfect freedom will be realized only in the eschaton, when sin is eradicated.
    - "To serve God is to reign; but to serve lusts, is slavery." (Sermons)

4. **The Will Remains Active, Not Passive**
    - The human will is not coerced by grace but is enabled and moved by it.
    - Conversion involves a real, though grace-empowered, act of the human will.
    - The will cooperates with grace after being liberated, but never initiates salvation.
    - Human responsibility is upheld even as divine sovereignty is emphasized.
    - "He who created you without you, will not justify you without you." (Sermons)

5. **Sin as Privation of Good**
    - Sin is not a substance but a privation or lack of the good that ought to be present.
    - Evil has no independent existence; it is a corruption of created goodness.
    - The will turns away from the highest good (God) to lesser goods, resulting in sin.
    - This metaphysical view undergirds Augustine’s understanding of moral disorder.
    - "For evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'" (City of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **original sin** and the necessity of **grace** shaped the entire trajectory of Western Christian thought, influencing both Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. His views on the bondage of the will and the transformative power of grace were central to later debates, especially during the Reformation. The Augustinian framework remains a touchstone for discussions of **human nature**, freedom, and divine sovereignty. His legacy endures in ongoing theological reflection on the relationship between sin, freedom, and salvation.
