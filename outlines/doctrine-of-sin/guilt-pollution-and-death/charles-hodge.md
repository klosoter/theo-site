# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, articulated a classic **Reformed doctrine of sin** that emphasized the reality of **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** as consequences of the Fall. He maintained that **original sin** involves both the imputation of Adam’s guilt and the inherent corruption of human nature, resulting in spiritual and physical death for all humanity.

- "The consequences of Adam’s sin to his posterity are, first, the loss of original righteousness; second, the corruption of nature; and third, the liability to all the penal evils which Adam incurred, temporal and eternal." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Imputed Guilt**
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity, so his guilt is judicially imputed to all his descendants.
    - This imputation is not merely a matter of influence but a real legal standing before God.
    - Hodge distinguishes between **imputed guilt** and personal acts of sin, yet both are present in all people.
    - The doctrine safeguards the necessity of **justification by faith** in Christ as the only remedy.
    - "The sin of Adam, therefore, is the judicial ground of the condemnation of his race." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Pollution as Inherited Corruption**
    - All humans inherit a **corrupt nature** from Adam, affecting every faculty of the soul.
    - This corruption is total, rendering humanity unable to please God apart from grace.
    - Hodge emphasizes the distinction between **guilt** (forensic) and **pollution** (moral/spiritual).
    - The pollution of sin is the source of all actual transgressions in human life.
    - "Original sin, as it exists in us, is both guilt and pollution." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Death as the Penalty of Sin**
    - **Death**—spiritual, physical, and eternal—is the just penalty for sin according to divine justice.
    - Hodge affirms that death entered the world through Adam’s transgression, affecting all his posterity.
    - He distinguishes between **spiritual death** (alienation from God) and **physical death** (mortality).
    - The universality of death is evidence of the universality of sin and its consequences.
    - "Death, in all its forms, is the penalty of sin." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Necessity of Regeneration**
    - Because of guilt and pollution, fallen humans are utterly dependent on **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit.
    - Regeneration is a supernatural act that imparts new spiritual life and breaks the dominion of sin.
    - Hodge insists that moral reformation is insufficient; only a new birth can address the depth of human depravity.
    - This underscores the **monergistic** character of salvation in Reformed theology.
    - "Regeneration is the instantaneous change from spiritual death to spiritual life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Union with Christ as Remedy**
    - The benefits of Christ’s work—justification, sanctification, and glorification—are applied through **union with Christ**.
    - In Christ, the guilt of sin is pardoned, the pollution of sin is cleansed, and the power of death is overcome.
    - Hodge stresses that all saving blessings flow from this vital union, not from human merit.
    - The restoration of righteousness and life comes only through faith in the Redeemer.
    - "All the blessings of redemption are inseparably connected with union with Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Charles Hodge’s articulation of **guilt, pollution, and death** shaped generations of Reformed theology, especially within the American Presbyterian tradition. His careful distinctions and systematic clarity provided a foundation for later theologians at Princeton and beyond. Hodge’s influence endures in discussions of **original sin**, federal headship, and the necessity of grace, making his work a touchstone for evangelical and Reformed understandings of human depravity and redemption.
