# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust Reformed understanding of **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** as consequences of **original sin** and the fall. These confessions emphasize the total depravity of humanity, the imputation of Adam’s guilt, the pervasive corruption of human nature, and the necessity of **regeneration** and **atonement** through Christ for deliverance from both the guilt and power of sin.

- "We believe that through the disobedience of Adam original sin is extended to all mankind; which is a corruption of the whole nature and a hereditary disease wherewith infants themselves are infected even in their mother’s womb." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 14–17
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 5–8, 12–19, 43
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. First Head of Doctrine, Articles 1–3, Rejection of Errors 1–3
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical and Reformed Creeds and Confessions)
- The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism: A Reformation Synthesis (Lyle D. Bierma)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin and Imputed Guilt**
   - Humanity inherits **guilt** from Adam’s first transgression.
   - All people are born under the just condemnation of God.
   - This guilt is not merely the result of imitation but of imputation.
   - Even infants are included in this state of guilt before God.
   - "Original sin is a corruption of the whole nature and a hereditary disease." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

2. **Total Depravity and Pollution**
   - The fall resulted in the **pollution** of every aspect of human nature.
   - No part of humanity remains untainted by sin.
   - This corruption renders humans incapable of any spiritual good.
   - The pollution of sin is both inherited and actualized in personal acts.
   - "We are so corrupt that we are wholly incapable of doing any good, and inclined to all wickedness." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 8)

3. **Death as the Wages of Sin**
   - **Death**—spiritual, physical, and eternal—is the just consequence of sin.
   - Adam’s sin brought death to all his descendants.
   - Death is both a penalty and a manifestation of separation from God.
   - Only Christ’s work can deliver from the dominion of death.
   - "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men." (Canons of Dort, I.1)

4. **Necessity of Regeneration and Atonement**
   - Deliverance from guilt, pollution, and death requires **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit.
   - Christ’s atoning sacrifice is the only ground for forgiveness and cleansing.
   - Regeneration restores spiritual life lost in Adam.
   - Faith in Christ unites the believer to the benefits of his redemptive work.
   - "Unless we are regenerated by the Spirit of God, we are incapable of any saving good." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 8)

5. **Union with Christ and New Life**
   - Believers are united to Christ, sharing in his righteousness and life.
   - This union results in the forgiveness of guilt and renewal from pollution.
   - The power of death is broken through Christ’s resurrection.
   - Sanctification is the ongoing work of overcoming sin’s pollution.
   - "By his power we are raised up to a new life." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 45)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed soteriology**, providing a clear and comprehensive account of the human plight in guilt, pollution, and death, and the necessity of redemption in Christ. Their formulations continue to serve as doctrinal standards for Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring confessional clarity on the effects of the fall and the scope of salvation. The enduring influence of these confessions is evident in their ongoing use for catechesis, theological education, and ecumenical dialogue.
