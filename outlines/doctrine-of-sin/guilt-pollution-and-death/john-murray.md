# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading Reformed theologian, articulated a robust doctrine of **sin** that emphasized the interconnected realities of **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** as consequences of the **fall**. He maintained that these aspects are not merely legal or forensic but also profoundly affect the moral and existential condition of humanity, necessitating the comprehensive work of **redemption** accomplished by Christ.

- "Sin carries with it both guilt and pollution, and the wages of sin is death." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

## Key Works

- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT)
- The Imputation of Adam’s Sin
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- Principles of Conduct

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Guilt as Forensic Liability**
    - Guilt is the judicial liability to the **penal sanctions** of God's law.
    - It is inherited from Adam through the doctrine of **imputation**.
    - Guilt is objective and not merely a subjective feeling.
    - Only the work of Christ can remove guilt before God.
    - "Guilt is the liability to punishment and is the judicial ground of the sentence of death." (The Imputation of Adam’s Sin)

2. **Pollution as Moral Corruption**
    - Pollution refers to the inherent **corruption** of human nature due to sin.
    - It affects every aspect of the person: mind, will, and affections.
    - Pollution is transmitted to all humanity through **original sin**.
    - Sanctification addresses pollution by renewing the image of God in man.
    - "Sin is not only guilt but also pollution, a defilement of the whole being." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

3. **Death as the Wages of Sin**
    - Death is the comprehensive penalty for sin, encompassing **spiritual**, **physical**, and **eternal death**.
    - It is both a present reality and an eschatological judgment.
    - Death entered the world through Adam’s transgression.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the decisive victory over death for believers.
    - "Death is the wages of sin, and it is only in Christ that death is swallowed up in victory." (The Epistle to the Romans)

4. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity, so his guilt and corruption are imputed to all.
    - This headship is the basis for understanding the transmission of guilt and pollution.
    - Christ, as the second Adam, brings justification and life through his obedience.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to Murray’s soteriology.
    - "The principle of representation is basic to the imputation of both sin and righteousness." (The Imputation of Adam’s Sin)

5. **Redemption as Comprehensive Deliverance**
    - Redemption in Christ addresses guilt, pollution, and death in their entirety.
    - Justification removes guilt; sanctification overcomes pollution; glorification conquers death.
    - The application of redemption is rooted in union with Christ.
    - The benefits of redemption are inseparable and flow from Christ’s finished work.
    - "The salvation wrought by Christ is as comprehensive as the need created by sin." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s nuanced articulation of **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** has shaped contemporary Reformed understanding of the doctrine of sin and salvation. His emphasis on the comprehensive effects of the fall and the equally comprehensive scope of redemption remains influential in systematic theology. By grounding these doctrines in **federal headship** and the work of Christ, Murray provided a framework that continues to inform both academic and pastoral approaches to the human condition and the hope of the gospel.
