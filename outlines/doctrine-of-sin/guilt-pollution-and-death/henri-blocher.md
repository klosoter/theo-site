# Henri Blocher (1937– )

Henri Blocher approaches **guilt, pollution, and death** as interconnected consequences of the **Fall**, emphasizing their grounding in **original sin** and the historical reality of **Adam’s transgression**. He insists that these aspects are not merely metaphorical but reflect the deep rupture in the created order, affecting both human nature and the cosmos. Blocher’s analysis is marked by a careful engagement with **biblical theology**, seeking to uphold the seriousness of sin while avoiding both reductionism and mythologizing.

- "The threefold consequence—guilt, pollution, and death—constitutes the tragic legacy of Adam’s act, transmitted to all his descendants." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

## Key Works

- "Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle"
- "In the Beginning: The Opening Chapters of Genesis"
- "Evil and the Cross: Christian Thought and the Problem of Evil"
- "Original Sin: A Study in Evangelical Theology" (in various essays and collected volumes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Adam and the Fall**
    - Affirms the necessity of a real, historical **Adam** for grounding the universality of **guilt, pollution, and death**.
    - Argues that the **Fall** is a unique, non-repeatable event with cosmic consequences.
    - Rejects purely symbolic or mythological readings of Genesis 3.
    - Insists that the transmission of sin is rooted in the solidarity of the human race with Adam.
    - "The reality of Adam’s transgression is the foundation for the universality of sin and its consequences." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

2. **Guilt as Forensic and Relational**
    - Defines **guilt** as both a legal status before God and a rupture in relationship.
    - Emphasizes that guilt is inherited, not merely imitated.
    - Connects guilt to the necessity of **justification** in Christ.
    - Warns against reducing guilt to subjective feelings or mere social constructs.
    - "Guilt is the objective liability to punishment, not simply a sense of shame." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

3. **Pollution as Corruption of Nature**
    - Describes **pollution** as the pervasive corruption affecting every aspect of human nature.
    - Stresses that pollution is both individual and corporate, affecting all humanity.
    - Links pollution to the loss of original righteousness and the distortion of the imago Dei.
    - Maintains that pollution necessitates **regeneration** and sanctification.
    - "Pollution is the taint that sin has left on our very being, requiring a radical renewal." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

4. **Death as Judicial and Existential**
    - Interprets **death** as both a judicial penalty and an existential reality.
    - Affirms that physical, spiritual, and eternal death are all consequences of sin.
    - Argues that death is not natural to humanity but an intrusion due to the Fall.
    - Sees Christ’s resurrection as the definitive answer to death’s reign.
    - "Death, in all its forms, is the outworking of the sentence pronounced in Eden." ("In the Beginning")

5. **Christ as the Remedy for Guilt, Pollution, and Death**
    - Asserts that only Christ’s work addresses all three dimensions: **justification** (guilt), **sanctification** (pollution), and **resurrection** (death).
    - Emphasizes the necessity of union with Christ for deliverance from sin’s consequences.
    - Highlights the eschatological hope of full restoration in the new creation.
    - Insists that the gospel must confront the whole scope of sin’s effects.
    - "The salvation Christ brings is as comprehensive as the ruin wrought by Adam." ("Evil and the Cross")

## Legacy and Impact

Blocher’s nuanced articulation of **original sin** and its consequences has shaped contemporary evangelical and Reformed discussions on the doctrine of humanity. His insistence on the historical reality of the Fall and the seriousness of **guilt, pollution, and death** has provided a robust alternative to both liberal and overly simplistic evangelical treatments. Blocher’s work continues to influence debates on the relationship between science, Scripture, and the doctrine of sin, ensuring that the tragic legacy of Adam remains central in theological anthropology.
