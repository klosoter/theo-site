# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema, a Reformed theologian, addressed the human condition in terms of **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** as the comprehensive consequences of **original sin**. He emphasized that these effects are not merely legal or external but profoundly affect the whole person, necessitating a holistic understanding of **redemption** in Christ. Hoekema’s approach integrates the forensic, moral, and existential aspects of humanity’s fallen state.

- "Because of Adam’s sin, all men are born in a state of guilt, pollution, and death." ("Created in God's Image")

## Key Works

- Created in God's Image (1986)
- Saved by Grace (1989)
- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- The Four Major Cults (1963)
- "Sin, Original" in Evangelical Dictionary of Theology (ed. Elwell)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Guilt as Forensic Condemnation**
    - Humanity inherits **guilt** from Adam as a legal status before God.
    - This guilt is imputed to all people, not merely the result of individual acts.
    - The doctrine is rooted in **federal headship** and **Romans 5**.
    - Only the work of Christ can remove this guilt through justification.
    - "The guilt of Adam’s sin is imputed to all his descendants." (Created in God's Image)

2. **Pollution as Corruption of Nature**
    - **Pollution** refers to the moral and spiritual corruption affecting every aspect of human nature.
    - This corruption is both inherited and pervasive, impacting mind, will, and affections.
    - Hoekema stresses that pollution is not merely external but internal and total.
    - Regeneration is necessary to begin the process of cleansing from this pollution.
    - "We are not only guilty in Adam, but also polluted in him." (Created in God's Image)

3. **Death as Comprehensive Consequence**
    - **Death** includes physical, spiritual, and eternal dimensions.
    - Spiritual death is immediate alienation from God; physical death is the eventual result.
    - Eternal death is the final outcome apart from redemption in Christ.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the only solution to the reign of death.
    - "Death, in Scripture, is always seen as the penalty for sin." (Saved by Grace)

4. **Unity of Sin’s Effects**
    - Guilt, pollution, and death are inseparable aspects of the human condition.
    - Hoekema rejects any reductionistic view that isolates one effect from the others.
    - The whole person—legal standing, moral nature, and existential reality—is affected.
    - Salvation must address all three aspects to be truly redemptive.
    - "Sin’s consequences are not limited to guilt, but include pollution and death as well." (Created in God's Image)

5. **Redemption as Holistic Restoration**
    - Christ’s work addresses guilt (justification), pollution (sanctification), and death (resurrection).
    - Hoekema emphasizes the **already/not yet** tension in the application of redemption.
    - Believers experience initial deliverance now, with full restoration in the future.
    - The church is called to witness to this comprehensive salvation.
    - "Redemption in Christ reverses all the effects of sin: guilt, pollution, and death." (Saved by Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** has shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology and soteriology, especially in the context of systematic theology. His insistence on the holistic effects of sin and the comprehensive nature of redemption has influenced evangelical discussions on the doctrine of man and salvation. By integrating biblical, theological, and pastoral concerns, Hoekema provided a framework that remains influential for understanding the depth of human need and the scope of Christ’s work.
