# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth addressed **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** within the framework of **Christocentric reconciliation** and the doctrine of **sin**. He emphasized the universality of human estrangement from God, the radical depth of human corruption, and the decisive overcoming of these realities in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.

- "Sin is the contradiction of the divine command, and as such it is guilt, pollution, and death." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics I/2: The Doctrine of God
- Church Dogmatics II/1: The Doctrine of God
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Karl Barth: A Theology of Word and Spirit (by Gary Dorrien)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Guilt, Pollution, and Death**
    - Barth defines **sin** as a threefold reality: guilt (forensic), pollution (ontological), and death (existential consequence).
    - These aspects are inseparable and together constitute humanity’s alienation from God.
    - Guilt refers to humanity’s objective liability before God’s judgment.
    - Pollution denotes the corruption and disorder introduced into human nature and creation.
    - "Sin is not merely an act but a state, a condition in which man stands before God." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Christ as the Bearer and Overcomer of Sin**
    - Jesus Christ assumes the full weight of human guilt, pollution, and death.
    - In Christ’s obedience and sacrifice, the reality of sin is judged and overcome.
    - Barth insists that reconciliation is accomplished objectively in Christ, not subjectively in human experience.
    - The cross is the locus where guilt, pollution, and death are decisively addressed.
    - "He takes our place as the One who is judged in our stead, and thus overcomes our guilt, pollution, and death." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

3. **Universal Scope of Sin and Grace**
    - All humanity is implicated in guilt, pollution, and death due to Adamic solidarity.
    - Barth resists individualistic or merely moralistic accounts of sin.
    - The universality of sin is matched by the universality of Christ’s reconciling work.
    - Grace is not a potential but an actual reality in Christ for all.
    - "Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Sin as Contradiction of Divine Command**
    - Sin is fundamentally opposition to God’s will and command.
    - This contradiction manifests as guilt (legal), pollution (moral/spiritual), and death (existential/ontological).
    - Barth emphasizes the relational and covenantal nature of sin.
    - The divine command exposes the depth of human lostness and need for grace.
    - "Sin is the contradiction of the divine command, and as such it is guilt, pollution, and death." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

5. **Death as the Final Enemy**
    - Death is not merely biological but signifies ultimate alienation from God.
    - Barth views death as the culmination and manifestation of guilt and pollution.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the definitive victory over death.
    - The hope of new life is grounded in the resurrection, not in human achievement.
    - "Death is the sign and seal of man’s separation from God, but in Christ it is overcome." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s treatment of **guilt, pollution, and death** reoriented modern theology toward a more robust, Christ-centered doctrine of sin and reconciliation. His insistence on the objective reality of both sin and grace challenged both liberal and conservative paradigms. Barth’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of **atonement**, the nature of sin, and the meaning of human existence before God. His work remains foundational for theologians wrestling with the depth of human brokenness and the scope of divine redemption.
