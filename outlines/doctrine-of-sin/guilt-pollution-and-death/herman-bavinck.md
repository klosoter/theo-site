# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck addresses **guilt, pollution, and death** as the threefold consequence of **original sin** within his Reformed dogmatics. He emphasizes that humanity’s fallen condition is not merely legal but also existential and relational, affecting both our standing before God (**guilt**), our inner nature (**pollution**), and our mortal destiny (**death**). Bavinck’s treatment integrates these realities into a comprehensive doctrine of **sin** and its effects on the human race.

- "Sin brings with it guilt, pollution, and death, and in all three respects the whole human race is involved." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.58)

- The Sacrifice of Praise

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Guilt as Forensic Liability**
    - Guilt is the objective legal status of humanity before God due to **Adam’s transgression**.
    - It is imputed to all people, making them liable to **divine judgment**.
    - Guilt is not merely subjective feeling but a real standing under the **law’s condemnation**.
    - Only **justification in Christ** can remove this guilt.
    - "Guilt is the liability to punishment that arises from the violation of God’s law." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.58)

2. **Pollution as Corruption of Nature**
    - Pollution refers to the **inherent corruption** of human nature resulting from the fall.
    - It affects every aspect of human existence: mind, will, affections, and body.
    - This corruption is transmitted to all descendants of Adam, making sin universal.
    - Pollution is both a state and a power, rendering humanity unable to please God apart from grace.
    - "Sin is not only guilt but also pollution, a corruption of our entire nature." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.58)

3. **Death as the Wages of Sin**
    - Death is the judicial and existential consequence of sin, encompassing **physical, spiritual, and eternal death**.
    - It is both a penalty and a manifestation of separation from God.
    - Bavinck sees death as the ultimate expression of humanity’s alienation and impotence.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the only remedy for death’s dominion.
    - "Death is the wages of sin, the final and most dreadful consequence of the fall." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.58)

4. **Unity of Guilt, Pollution, and Death**
    - These three consequences are inseparable and together define the human predicament.
    - Bavinck insists that a reductionist view of sin (as only guilt or only pollution) distorts the gospel.
    - The work of Christ addresses all three: removing guilt, cleansing pollution, and conquering death.
    - The church’s ministry must proclaim deliverance from each aspect.
    - "The misery of sin is threefold: guilt, pollution, and death, and redemption must be as comprehensive as the fall." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.58)

5. **Solidarity of the Human Race in Sin**
    - All humanity is united in Adam and thus shares in his guilt, pollution, and death.
    - Bavinck grounds this solidarity in the **covenant of works** and the organic unity of the human race.
    - This universality underscores the need for a universal Savior.
    - The doctrine safeguards both the seriousness of sin and the scope of redemption.
    - "In Adam all have sinned, and in him all bear the consequences: guilt, pollution, and death." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.58)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of **guilt, pollution, and death** has shaped modern Reformed theology’s understanding of the depth and breadth of human sinfulness. His integration of legal, existential, and relational dimensions continues to inform contemporary discussions on **original sin** and **redemption**. Bavinck’s nuanced approach ensures that the gospel is seen as addressing the whole human condition, not merely isolated aspects, and his influence endures in both academic and pastoral contexts.
