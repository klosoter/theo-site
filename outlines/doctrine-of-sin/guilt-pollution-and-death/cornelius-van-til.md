# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **guilt, pollution, and death** within the framework of **Reformed anthropology** and **covenant theology**, emphasizing the radical effects of the **fall** on human nature and experience. He argued that these realities are not merely psychological or existential, but are rooted in the objective breach of the **covenant of works**, resulting in total depravity and the necessity of **redemptive revelation** in Christ.

- "Sin is not merely an ethical mistake; it is a rupture of the covenant relationship with God, bringing guilt, pollution, and death upon all mankind." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Guilt as Covenant Breach**
    - Guilt arises from the objective violation of the **covenant of works** with God.
    - All humanity is implicated in Adam’s first sin, inheriting both guilt and liability to punishment.
    - Guilt is not merely subjective feeling, but a forensic reality before the holy God.
    - Only the work of Christ can remove this guilt, as He fulfills the demands of the covenant.
    - "The guilt of sin is the legal consequence of man’s rebellion against God’s covenantal authority." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Pollution as Total Depravity**
    - Sin’s pollution affects every aspect of human nature—mind, will, and affections.
    - There is no neutral ground; even human reasoning is corrupted by sin.
    - The noetic effects of sin mean that fallen humanity suppresses the truth in unrighteousness.
    - Regeneration is necessary for the restoration of true knowledge and holiness.
    - "The pollution of sin is such that man is wholly opposed to God in his thoughts and actions." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Death as Judicial Sentence**
    - Physical, spiritual, and eternal death are all consequences of Adam’s transgression.
    - Death is not natural, but a judicial penalty imposed by God for covenant disobedience.
    - Spiritual death entails alienation from God and inability to respond to Him apart from grace.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the only remedy for the reign of death.
    - "Death is the execution of the sentence pronounced upon covenant breakers." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Antithesis and the Human Condition**
    - The fall establishes an antithesis between the regenerate and unregenerate.
    - This antithesis is rooted in the realities of guilt, pollution, and death.
    - The unregenerate suppress the knowledge of God, while the regenerate are restored to fellowship.
    - The church is called to witness to this antithesis in every sphere of life.
    - "The antithesis is the inevitable result of the entrance of sin, bringing guilt, pollution, and death." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Redemption as Covenant Restoration**
    - Redemption addresses guilt, pollution, and death through Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - Justification removes guilt; sanctification cleanses pollution; glorification conquers death.
    - The application of redemption is covenantal and Trinitarian in scope.
    - The Christian life is lived in gratitude for deliverance from these consequences of sin.
    - "Redemption is the restoration of covenant fellowship, overcoming guilt, pollution, and death in Christ." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **guilt, pollution, and death** profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and anthropology, emphasizing the radical effects of the fall and the necessity of Christ’s redemptive work. His insistence on the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief influenced generations of theologians and apologists. Van Til’s covenantal approach continues to inform discussions on human nature, sin, and salvation within confessional Reformed circles.
