# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. addresses **guilt, pollution, and death** through the central motif of **union with Christ**, emphasizing that all aspects of human fallenness are overcome in the believer’s participation in Christ’s death and resurrection. He situates these realities within the **ordo salutis** as realized in the **historia salutis**, highlighting the eschatological transformation inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection and the inseparability of **justification** and **sanctification**.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event in the history of redemption, securing both the removal of guilt and the renewal of life." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Perspectives on Pentecost: Studies in New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (in The Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Justification and Eschatology" (in Justified in Christ, ed. K. Scott Oliphint)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Center of Salvation**
    - All benefits of salvation, including the removal of guilt, cleansing from pollution, and deliverance from death, flow from **union with Christ**.
    - Union with Christ is both **forensic** and **transformative**, encompassing justification and sanctification.
    - The believer’s participation in Christ’s death addresses guilt and pollution, while participation in his resurrection brings new life.
    - This union is inaugurated by the **Holy Spirit** and is foundational for all soteriological blessings.
    "Union with the exalted Christ by the Spirit is the central soteriological reality for Paul." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Eschatological Structure of Salvation**
    - **Guilt, pollution, and death** are overcome in the context of redemptive history, climaxing in Christ’s resurrection.
    - The resurrection is not only proof of justification but also the beginning of **new creation life** for believers.
    - The already/not yet tension shapes the believer’s experience of deliverance from sin and death.
    - Final victory over death awaits the consummation, but its decisive defeat is already accomplished in Christ.
    "The resurrection is the eschatological hinge on which the entire order of salvation turns." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Justification and Sanctification: Distinct but Inseparable**
    - **Justification** addresses the removal of guilt; **sanctification** addresses pollution, but both are inseparable in union with Christ.
    - Both are benefits received simultaneously through faith, not sequentially.
    - The forensic and transformative aspects of salvation are rooted in the same Christ-event.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in the objective work of Christ and the Spirit’s application.
    "Justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable aspects of the believer’s union with Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Death as Both Penalty and Power**
    - Death is the judicial penalty for sin and the existential power that reigns over fallen humanity.
    - Christ’s death satisfies the penalty and breaks the dominion of death for those united to him.
    - The believer’s spiritual resurrection now anticipates bodily resurrection at Christ’s return.
    - Death’s defeat is both a present reality and a future hope for the church.
    "Death is not only the penalty for sin but also the power from which Christ delivers his people." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Applying Redemption**
    - The **Holy Spirit** unites believers to Christ, applying the benefits of his death and resurrection.
    - Through the Spirit, guilt is pardoned, pollution is cleansed, and new life is imparted.
    - The Spirit’s work is both definitive (regeneration) and progressive (sanctification).
    - Assurance and perseverance are grounded in the Spirit’s ongoing ministry.
    "The Spirit is the bond of union with Christ and the agent of all redemptive benefits." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust emphasis on **union with Christ** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology, especially in understanding the relationship between justification, sanctification, and glorification. His eschatological reading of Paul has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, particularly within the Westminster tradition. By integrating **biblical theology** with systematic categories, Gaffin has provided a framework for addressing guilt, pollution, and death that is both doctrinally rich and pastorally relevant. His work continues to inform debates on the ordo salutis and the nature of salvation in Christ.
