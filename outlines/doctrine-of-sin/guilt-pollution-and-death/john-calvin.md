# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of **guilt, pollution, and death** is rooted in his understanding of **original sin** and the **fall** of humanity. He teaches that all people inherit both the **guilt** of Adam’s first transgression and a pervasive **corruption** of nature, resulting in spiritual and physical **death** apart from the **grace of Christ**.

- "Original sin, therefore, seems to be a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature, diffused into all parts of the soul, which first makes us liable to God’s wrath, then also brings forth in us those works which Scripture calls 'works of the flesh.'" (Institutes 2.1.8)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Both Guilt and Corruption**
    - Humanity inherits both the **legal guilt** and **moral pollution** of Adam’s sin.
    - This condition is not merely imitation but a real transmission of **depravity**.
    - All faculties of the soul are affected, leaving no part untainted.
    - The result is universal **condemnation** and inability to please God.
    - "We are so vitiated and perverted in every part of our nature that by this great corruption we stand justly condemned and convicted before God." (Institutes 2.1.9)

2. **Death as the Wages of Sin**
    - **Physical death** entered the world as a direct consequence of Adam’s disobedience.
    - **Spiritual death**—alienation from God—precedes and underlies physical death.
    - Death is both a punishment and a sign of the need for **redemption**.
    - Only union with Christ can reverse the effects of death.
    - "For as soon as sin made its entrance, it brought with it the penalty of death." (Institutes 2.1.6)

3. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - The corruption of nature renders humans incapable of true **righteousness**.
    - Even the best human works are tainted by sin and cannot merit favor.
    - The will is enslaved to sin until liberated by **regenerating grace**.
    - This depravity is universal, affecting all people without exception.
    - "Man’s nature is not only utterly devoid of goodness, but so prolific in all kinds of evil that it can never be idle." (Institutes 2.3.5)

4. **Imputation and Federal Headship**
    - Adam acts as the **federal head** of humanity; his guilt is imputed to all.
    - Christ, as the second Adam, provides **righteousness** by imputation to believers.
    - The legal aspect of guilt is as important as the moral aspect of pollution.
    - Justification addresses both the removal of guilt and the restoration of righteousness.
    - "For as the sin of Adam has made us guilty before God, so the righteousness of Christ frees us from condemnation." (Commentary on Romans 5:18)

5. **Necessity of Grace and Regeneration**
    - Deliverance from guilt, pollution, and death is possible only by **sovereign grace**.
    - The **Holy Spirit** applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the elect.
    - Regeneration renews the corrupted nature and restores fellowship with God.
    - Sanctification progressively overcomes the pollution of sin in the believer.
    - "We are restored by the grace of Christ to that righteousness from which we fell, and by his death we are delivered from the curse and death." (Institutes 2.1.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of **original sin**, guilt, and the consequences of the fall has profoundly shaped the **Reformed tradition** and its understanding of human nature and salvation. His emphasis on both the legal and moral dimensions of sin influenced later confessional standards and systematic theologies. Calvin’s clear distinction between **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** remains foundational for Reformed anthropology and soteriology, ensuring that the necessity of grace and the work of Christ are central in discussions of redemption.
