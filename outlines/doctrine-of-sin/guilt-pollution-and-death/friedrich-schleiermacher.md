# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **guilt, pollution, and death** within the framework of human **God-consciousness** and the disruption of the **feeling of absolute dependence**. Rather than viewing these as primarily forensic or ontological realities, he saw them as existential conditions reflecting the alienation of the self from God and the community, which manifests as a loss of spiritual vitality and harmony. For Schleiermacher, **sin** is the root of guilt and pollution, and **death** is both a natural and spiritual consequence of humanity's estrangement from the divine.

- "Sin is simply the lack of God-consciousness, and guilt is the consciousness of this lack." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Disruption of God-Consciousness**
    - Sin is fundamentally the disturbance or suppression of the **God-consciousness** within the human spirit.
    - This disruption leads to a state of alienation from both God and the community.
    - Sin is not primarily a legal transgression but an existential condition.
    - The universality of sin is rooted in the shared human condition, not inherited guilt.
    - "Sin is the disturbance of the God-consciousness, which is the basis of all true life." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Guilt as Self-Consciousness of Sin**
    - Guilt arises from the individual's awareness of their own alienation from God.
    - It is an existential and psychological reality, not merely a juridical status.
    - Guilt is experienced as the loss of spiritual wholeness and harmony.
    - The sense of guilt motivates the search for **redemption** and reconciliation.
    - "Guilt is the consciousness of sin, the feeling of having lost the divine fellowship." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Pollution as Social and Spiritual Estrangement**
    - Pollution is the communal and relational effect of sin, disrupting the unity of the church and humanity.
    - It is not a metaphysical stain but a breakdown in spiritual and ethical relationships.
    - Pollution manifests in the fragmentation of the self and society.
    - Restoration requires the renewal of the God-consciousness within the community.
    - "The pollution of sin is the disturbance of the fellowship of the Spirit." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Death as Natural and Spiritual Consequence**
    - Death is both a biological reality and a symbol of spiritual alienation.
    - Physical death is natural, but spiritual death results from the loss of God-consciousness.
    - Death is not a punishment in the forensic sense but a manifestation of estrangement from divine life.
    - Overcoming death involves the restoration of the God-consciousness through Christ.
    - "Death is the visible sign of the separation from the divine life." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Redemption as Restoration of God-Consciousness**
    - Redemption is the process by which the God-consciousness is restored in the individual and community.
    - Christ is the archetype of perfect God-consciousness, enabling reconciliation.
    - Redemption addresses guilt, pollution, and death by reestablishing spiritual unity.
    - The work of the Holy Spirit actualizes this restoration in believers.
    - "Redemption is the communication of the God-consciousness that was in Christ to all humanity." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s redefinition of **guilt, pollution, and death** profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology by shifting the focus from legal and metaphysical categories to existential and relational dynamics. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** and the inner life influenced later liberal theology and the development of religious existentialism. While criticized by confessional traditions for downplaying objective guilt and original sin, his work remains foundational for understanding the psychological and communal dimensions of sin and redemption in contemporary theology.
