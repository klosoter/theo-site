# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached **guilt, pollution, and death** through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the forensic and cultic dimensions of human fallenness. He argued that Adam’s breach of the **covenant of works** resulted in judicial **guilt**, existential **pollution**, and the intrusion of **death** as both a penalty and a cosmic disruption. Kline’s biblical-theological method traced these realities through the structure of redemptive history and the typology of **sacrificial atonement**.

- "The curse of the covenant is the judicial sentence of death, which includes both guilt and pollution, and is removed only by the atoning work of the Redeemer." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant Sanctions and Judicial Guilt**
    - The **covenant of works** established Adam as a federal head, whose disobedience incurred judicial guilt for all humanity.
    - Guilt is fundamentally a legal status before God, rooted in covenantal transgression.
    - The curse of the covenant is expressed in the sentence of death, encompassing both physical and spiritual dimensions.
    - Kline emphasizes the forensic nature of guilt, distinguishing it from subjective feelings of shame.
    - "The judicial verdict of the covenant lawsuit is the source of man’s guilt and death." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Pollution as Cultic and Cosmic Defilement**
    - Pollution is not merely moral but also cultic, affecting the sanctuary and the created order.
    - Adam’s sin introduced defilement into the world, necessitating expiatory rites in redemptive history.
    - The Levitical system typologically pointed to the removal of pollution through sacrificial blood.
    - Pollution is both a consequence of guilt and a barrier to communion with the holy God.
    - "The pollution of sin is a defilement that requires cleansing, as typified in the ritual system." (By Oath Consigned)

3. **Death as Covenant Curse**
    - Death is the ultimate sanction of the broken covenant, encompassing physical, spiritual, and eternal aspects.
    - Kline interprets death as both a penalty and an exile from God’s presence.
    - The motif of exile in Scripture is a manifestation of the death-curse upon humanity.
    - Christ’s atoning work reverses the curse by undergoing death as a substitute.
    - "Death is the penal sanction of the violated covenant, the curse that Christ bore for his people." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Typology and Sacrificial Atonement**
    - The sacrificial system is a typological anticipation of Christ’s atonement, addressing guilt, pollution, and death.
    - Blood rituals signify both propitiation (removal of guilt) and expiation (cleansing from pollution).
    - The Day of Atonement dramatizes the comprehensive removal of sin’s effects.
    - Kline’s typological method highlights the unity of redemptive history in dealing with human fallenness.
    - "The sacrificial blood is the divinely appointed means for the removal of both guilt and pollution." (Images of the Spirit)

5. **Eschatological Resolution in Christ**
    - The work of Christ fulfills the covenant by bearing guilt, cleansing pollution, and conquering death.
    - Resurrection is the eschatological reversal of the death-curse and the inauguration of new creation.
    - The church participates in this resolution through union with Christ and the sacraments.
    - Final judgment will consummate the removal of all guilt, pollution, and death from the cosmos.
    - "In Christ, the curse is lifted, and the people of God are restored to life, purity, and fellowship." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal framework for understanding **guilt, pollution, and death** has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in its integration of **forensic** and cultic categories. His typological reading of Scripture has influenced generations of scholars in tracing the unity of redemptive history. Kline’s emphasis on the covenantal structure of judgment and restoration continues to inform contemporary discussions on atonement and eschatology. His legacy endures in the ongoing development of Reformed covenant theology and its application to the doctrine of sin and salvation.
