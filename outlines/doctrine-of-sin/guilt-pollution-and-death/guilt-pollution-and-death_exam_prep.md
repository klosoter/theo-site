### ESSAY
Guilt, pollution, and death name the threefold misery of the human race under Adam, and they hold together as one reality under the terms of **federal theology**. By guilt I mean the moral-legal liability to condemnation before God’s law, a reatus that binds the sinner to punishment because of the truthfulness and immutability of divine justice. By pollution I mean the depraved habit and disorder of the human will and affections, the privation of original righteousness that issues in concupiscence and disordered loves. By death I mean the penal dissolution of life in three modes: spiritual alienation from God, bodily mortality, and ultimate eschatological perdition. These are not separable compartments but ordered effects of a single covenantal catastrophe: in Adam all sinned and are constituted sinners. The essay will trace how this threefold structure emerges from Scripture and is clarified by decisive figures, and it will defend the Reformed claim that these miseries are federal, inherited, and penal, yet overcome by the triune God’s grace in the second Adam through **union with Christ**.

Augustine set the grammar. Contending with Pelagius in early fifth-century North Africa, he read Genesis 2 to 3, Romans 5, and Psalm 51 as describing a race that fell in its root. In Adam, the whole nature was vitiated and subjected to the law of sin. For Augustine, guilt attaches first to Adam’s primal act as covenantal head, but it is truly ours because we were present in him according to the unity of human nature. Concupiscence—sexualized in his rhetoric but fundamentally a universal disorder of love—arises from the privation of original justice and is itself sin. Death is penalty, not nature: before the fall, man could not die; after the fall, man cannot but die. Three features from Augustine govern the later discussion. First, he maintains both a forensic and an ontological dimension of the fall. The human family is bound under reatus and its powers are internally corrupted. Second, he binds these under grace operating through Christ, who heals and justifies. Third, he refuses to imagine any fissure between the justice and mercy of God. Here is a Tacitean summer school in **divine simplicity**: God is one, and the giving over to death is not contrary to goodness but the manifestation of true order in a sin-wrecked world. Examiners will test whether Augustine conflates concupiscence and guilt or makes guilt depend on personal acts. Augustine is explicit that concupiscence is sin and its presence requires remission; he is equally clear that infants, though without personal acts, need grace because they are in Adam and under death.

Pelagius, the decisive foil, denies this. He insists that Adam’s sin harmed only himself, that death is natural, and that grace is primarily the law and the example of Christ. This reframing dissolves guilt into pedagogy, pollution into bad habits, and death into creation’s givenness rather than penalty. Pelagius thereby forced Augustine to articulate the racially corporate structure of sin. The Church’s condemnation of Pelagian and semi-Pelagian positions canonized the Augustinian judgment: sin is not merely imitation, grace is not merely exhortation, and death is not merely nature. Why does Pelagius still matter? Because his intuitions reappear wherever autonomy is overestimated and the corporate is minimized, from certain modern therapeutic accounts that deny true culpability to sociological theories that flatten sin into systems without addressing guilt. The Augustinian answer remains firm: our plight is deeper than habits, because guilt before the law precedes and fuels the deformity of the will. And death is not a neutral boundary of finitude but the wages of sin.

If Augustine established the twofold misery of guilt and pollution under the sign of death, Anselm explained why remission of guilt requires satisfaction. In Cur Deus Homo Anselm argues that God cannot simply remit without satisfaction, since that would invert order in the universe. The debt incurred by sin is measured by the dignity of the party offended, so only God can make the satisfaction, yet the satisfaction must be made by man. Therefore the God-man offers himself unto death. Anselm’s account is crucial for consolidating the forensic edge of guilt: it is debt, and death is the fitting consequent. He does not yet specify imputation as later Reformed theology will, nor does he provide a full account of how Christ’s death transforms the pollution of the will. But he supplies the backbone to say that remission of sin is an objective, legal act grounded in a once-for-all satisfaction. Anticipate the objection that Anselm reduces God to a feudal lord obsessed with honor. Anselm’s argument instead comes from **divine simplicity**: God’s rectitude is identical to himself, and his mercy fulfills justice by restoring order. The penal character of death is not an arbitrary infliction but the form justice takes where the greatest good is denied.

Calvin presses Augustine and Anselm forward by identifying the double grace given in Christ that matches the double misery. We are under the twofold ruin of guilt and pollution, and in Christ we receive **justification** and **sanctification**. Calvin defines original sin as hereditary depravity and the imputed guilt that exposes us to God’s wrath. He is explicit that infants are not innocent, since death reigns over them, and that both spiritual death under sin’s dominion and physical death are included in the penalty. He insists on an antithesis: while we affirm **total depravity**, we deny total destruction of the imago, which remains as a ground for human dignity and moral responsibility. This is not merely a pastoral aside; it guards against the examiner’s trap of thinking pollution abolishes agency. For Calvin, **union with Christ** is the principled center by which the removal of guilt and the renewal of life flow together. We are ingrafted into Christ, and from that union faith justifies by receiving the alien righteousness of Christ while the Spirit begins to mortify the flesh. One must not confuse these benefits nor divide them. There is no justification without sanctification, and yet justification is not sanctification. Calvin thereby draws the map on which guilt, pollution, and death are addressed: guilt is remitted by forensic imputation in justification, pollution is renovated by vivifying grace, and death is conquered by the resurrection life communicated in union.

Francis Turretin supplies the precision. Writing in the Reformed scholastic high period, he articulates **federal theology** with rigor. Adam stood under a **covenant of works** whereby life was promised on condition of perfect obedience. As the public person, his act is juridically imputed to his posterity. Turretin distinguishes two questions that often confuse students. First, how does Adam’s sin become ours? He defends **immediate imputation** against mediate schemes, which claim that we are condemned only because we inherit a corrupted nature. For Turretin, Romans 5 is explicit that condemnation arises because of the one transgression, and the hereditary corruption is itself a punishment. The order is crucial: guilt grounds pollution as penalty, not conversely. This matches the **analogia fidei** that reads Scripture’s parts in light of its whole and resists the human impulse to prioritize the ontic over the legal. Second, what is the relation between spiritual and physical death? He argues that spiritual death is first and most fundamental. The separation from God’s favor places the sinner under the curse so that bodily mortality ensues. Yet he refuses to collapse the bodily into mere symbol; physical death is also truly penal and ultimately consummates in eternal death apart from grace. Turretin functions as the most decisive figure for framing internal debates: he adjudicates traducianism versus creationism of the soul by noting that transmission of sin does not require a materialist account of generation but a federal relation; he guards against the confusion of guilt and pollution by distinguishing reatus culpae and reatus poenae; and he binds the entire discussion to the work of Christ, whose obedience is imputed and whose Spirit renews. Against the examiner’s challenge that imputation of another’s guilt violates personal responsibility, Turretin answers with the very structure of human political and familial life. Representation does not eliminate agency; it constitutes it. If federal headship is unjust, then the gospel itself would be unjust, for Christ’s righteousness could not be imputed to us. The symmetry of the two Adams in Romans 5 requires imputation both of sin and of righteousness. Justice here is covenantal justice, not abstract numerically distributive justice.

Jonathan Edwards extends this with a metaphysics of moral identity. In Original Sin he contends that the human race is one in a divine constitution, not through a numerical identity of substance but by a moral identity such that God regards and governs it as a unit in Adam. Edwards responds to modern individualism by arguing that unity of a collective moral agent is no more arbitrary than the unity of a person across time. The will’s acts today can be imputed to the self tomorrow because God has constituted such unity; similarly, Adam’s act is imputed because God has constituted the human race federally. Edwards also presses inability. Total depravity means moral inability to do spiritual good, yet natural faculties remain. This answers the objection that inherited **pollution** annihilates responsibility: responsibility follows from the metaphysical form of the will, not from a supposed indifference. His account also resists external critiques that reduce sin to social pathology. Structures matter, but the deeper fault line runs through the heart’s preference for self over God. Edwards’ account preserves the forensic and the moral without collapse and renders intelligible the universality and inevitability of death as the ordered penal wage of a race constituted in rebellion.

Having traced the lines through these figures, the doctrinal thesis can be stated exactly. Under the **covenant of works**, Adam’s sin is **immediately imputed** to his posterity such that all are born guilty before God’s law. This guilt entails liability to death in its spiritual, physical, and eternal forms. As penal consequences, these deaths are not detachable from God’s judicial act but are the form of his holy justice, identical with his goodness in the one life of God according to **divine simplicity**. The same act of God that gives over also orders by wisdom, which discloses death’s nature as the last enemy and the wages of sin. The imputed guilt is accompanied by a hereditary **pollution** of the nature that includes the privation of original righteousness and positive inclination to evil. The grace of the second Adam reverses this. Christ bears our guilt by **penal substitution**, satisfying the law’s demands, and his righteousness is imputed to us in **justification**. The Spirit unites us to Christ so that the reign of sin is broken and sanctification begins, addressing pollution. The resurrection of Christ is the decisive conquest of death and the pledge of our bodily renewal. Thus the threefold remedy matches the threefold ruin under the unity of **union with Christ**.

Internal debates within Reformed theology must be surveyed with clarity. The first concerns imputation. Some, like the mediate imputation school, make our condemnation follow from inherited corruption, which is then the cause of guilt. This collapses the forensic into the ontic and undercuts the parallel between Adam and Christ. The better view follows Turretin: imputation is immediate, and corruption is the punishment that arises from the legal sentence. This protects the justice of God’s law and the structure of **federal headship**. A second debate concerns the sequencing of spiritual and physical death. Certain readings privilege physical death as the mark of penalty because of Genesis 3. But the Reformed consensus holds that spiritual death is first, shown in Adam’s hiding and expulsion from God’s presence, and that bodily death follows as the enacted curse upon the dust. This guards against a domestication of sin to biology and rightly prioritizes reconciliation over mere longevity. A third internal debate touches traducianism and the transmission of depravity. Reformed writers are divided, but the decisive point is conceptual: whatever the genesis of individual souls, the participation in Adam’s guilt is legal, not ontological, and the propagation of corruption is a consequent disorder within a nature now bereft of original righteousness. This keeps anthropology from metaphysical speculation that confuses **pollution** with substance and guards the doctrine of creation’s goodness. Finally, within sanctification, some have overstated pollution as an ontic stain that precludes real renewal, risking antinomian conclusions. The classic Reformed view, reflected in Calvin and Owen, reads pollution as a depraved habitus that is progressively mortified by the Spirit in virtue of union, without compromising the definitive perfection of Christ’s righteousness imputed.

External critiques remain pressing. Roman Catholic theology at Trent affirms the fall’s universality but denies that concupiscence is truly sin in the justified, characterizing it as a tinder that inclines but is not sin without consent. Further, justification is made a process of infused righteousness rather than a forensic declaration. This revision blurs the distinction between guilt remitted and pollution healed and renders assurance precarious. The Reformed answer is that Scripture treats concupiscence as sin, requiring mortification and pardon, and that peace with God follows from a completed legal act grounded in Christ’s satisfaction. Eastern Orthodox accounts of ancestral sin preserve the corruption and death that follow Adam but refuse inherited guilt. This preserves a therapeutic vision but leaves death without the necessary juridical ground in God’s law. The Reformed reply is simple: the reign of death over those who have not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression shows condemnation prior to personal acts. Without forensic guilt, death becomes an ontological tragedy rather than a moral sentence, undermining the cross as atonement. Socinian and liberal Protestant positions deny **penal substitution**, treating death as the apotheosis of love or the exposure of scapegoating violence. Yet Scripture’s pattern and Anselm’s ratio demand satisfaction for real guilt. Without guilt, the cross is sign, not salvation; with guilt satisfied, the cross is the power of God unto salvation that also unmasks violence. Pelagian residues persist here too, shrinking grace to moral suasion. Reformed theology insists that grace is both pardon and power because sin is both **guilt** and **pollution**.

Contemporary challenges test the framework. Evolutionary accounts that place animal death before human sin raise the question whether death can be penal. The Reformed response distinguishes creaturely mortality in the wider animal world from the penal death promised to Adam. The narrative concerns the human vocation under the **covenant of works**; the imposition of death as curse concerns humanity as God’s vicegerent. Further, even if biological death exists before man, spiritual and judicial death, together with the human share in bodily mortality as curse, remain distinctively penal. Examiners will ask whether one can retain a historical Adam. The position defended here requires a real Adam as federal head; the two-Adam typology in Romans 5 cannot be evacuated into myth without dissolving justification as imputation. Another contemporary pressure comes from trauma discourse and the guilt-shame debate. Modern pastoral psychology often resists language of guilt in favor of shame and harm. The Reformed account can acknowledge profound involuntary suffering and name the shame that clings to victims of others’ sins, while maintaining that before God, guilt is real and must be dealt with by pardon. The gospel addresses both: Christ bears our guilt to remove our liability, and Christ cleanses our pollution and covers our shame, adopting us into honor. Structural sin and corporate injustice also test the doctrine. The federal frame accommodates corporate fault without erasing personal agency. Systems corrupt because persons love wrongly; persons sin in and through systems that magnify harm. Forgiveness and renewal therefore require both forensic absolution in Christ and personal and communal sanctification by the Spirit.

We must say a word on infants and those without mental capacity, a frequent examiner’s probe. The reign of death over infants shows they are not morally neutral. They share Adamic **guilt** by imputation and Adamic **pollution** by propagation. Yet the same federal pattern gives hope: election and **union with Christ** are not bounded by age or capacity. The Reformed confessions speak of elect infants dying in infancy being saved by Christ. Salvation never bypasses Christ; it simply applies his righteousness and life apart from conscious faith in ordinary cases, which God can do. This keeps the integrity of the doctrine while pastoring the flock.

The Christological implications must be guarded. Did Christ assume pollution or guilt in the incarnation? No. He assumed a true human nature without sin. He took our **guilt** not by ontological assumption but by legal **imputation** when he stood as surety. He bore **death** not as fitting consequence of his own sin but as penal substitute. He experienced spiritual death in the sense of the loss of the sense of God’s favorable presence under the curse, without any interior sin. He died bodily and in doing so destroyed death by death. The hypostatic union ensures that his obedience has infinite value; the forensics of imputation ensure that his obedience becomes ours.

Finally, integrative coherence across loci must be evident. Anthropology names the good creation of man in the image with a teleology of communion. Hamartiology names the deprivation and disorder, whose axes are **guilt** and **pollution** issuing in **death**. Covenant theology situates the fall under a real legal relation between God and man in Adam. Soteriology matches the cure to the disease in the ordo salutis: **effectual calling** creates spiritual life that counters spiritual death, **justification** removes guilt, **adoption** reverses alienation, **sanctification** heals pollution, and **glorification** reverses bodily death. Ecclesiology gathers the redeemed into a people undergoing this healing and forgiveness, administering the word and sacraments as instruments. Eschatology promises the destruction of death, the last enemy. Under **divine simplicity**, none of these acts of God are contrary to his love; in all he is one and simple, just and merciful toward the same sinners in Christ.

Anticipating objections sharpens confidence. Is the imputation of Adam’s guilt unjust? It is no more unjust than the imputation of Christ’s righteousness is merciful. In a universe governed by covenants, representation is intrinsic to personhood. Does **pollution** imply that sin is a substance? No, it is privation of original righteousness with positive disorder in the habits of the will; it does not create a metaphysical rival to God’s good creation. Is death natural or penal? For humanity under the covenant, it is penal. Even if creaturely finitude includes death elsewhere in creation, human death under sin stands as judgment. Does the Reformed view neglect the therapeutic? No; it honors the therapeutic by grounding it in the forensic. Without the cancellation of **guilt**, the healing of **pollution** is not only impossible but unjust, for God would be making crooked souls whole without addressing the law’s demand. Does this doctrine crush agency? It establishes it. By exposing the depth of our slavery to sin and judgment, it makes free grace real and therefore enlivens true obedience. All of this clarifies that guilt, pollution, and death are not a scattered set of woes but one covenantal plight under Adam answered by one covenantal salvation in Christ. The examiner’s final question is whether we can preach, pray, and pastor out of this. We must. We announce pardon to the guilty, cleansing to the polluted, and life to the dying because the second Adam has come.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Under Adam’s **federal headship**, humanity inherits forensic **guilt** before God’s law, hereditary **pollution** of nature, and penal **death** in spiritual, physical, and eternal modes; in Christ these are overcome by **penal substitution**, **justification**, **sanctification**, and resurrection through **union with Christ**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: original sin as guilt and concupiscence, death as penalty; grace necessary and sovereign.
  - Pelagius: denies inherited guilt and penal death, reduces grace to exhortation; decisive foil.
  - Anselm: satisfaction logic grounding remission of guilt and the necessity of Christ’s death.
  - Calvin: double misery and double grace, union with Christ, infants under death, total depravity without loss of agency.
  - Turretin: **covenant of works**, **immediate imputation**, priority of spiritual death, forensic-ontic distinctions, precision on internal debates.
  - Edwards: federal identity by divine constitution, moral inability with responsibility.
- Debates:
  - Internal: immediate vs mediate imputation; ordering of spiritual and physical death; traducianism vs creationism; relation of **justification** and **sanctification**.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian denials; Trent on concupiscence and infused righteousness; Orthodox ancestral sin without guilt; Socinian rejection of **penal substitution**.
  - Contemporary: evolution and death before the fall; guilt vs shame and trauma; structural sin; historic Adam.
- Defended position: Classic Reformed **federal theology** with immediate imputation of Adam’s guilt, real hereditary pollution, penal threefold death, and their remedy in Christ by imputed righteousness, renovative grace, and resurrection life.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Why is imputation just? Because covenantal representation structures both Adam and Christ; without it the gospel fails.
  - Is concupiscence sin? Yes; it is **pollution** requiring mortification and pardon.
  - Is death natural? Human death under the covenant is penal, the wages of sin.
  - How are guilt and pollution related? Guilt is primary and grounds pollution as punishment; both are addressed in distinct yet inseparable benefits.
  - What about infants? They share Adamic guilt and pollution, yet elect infants are saved by Christ through **union with Christ**.
