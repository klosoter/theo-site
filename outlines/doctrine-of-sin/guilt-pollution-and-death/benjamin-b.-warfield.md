# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield, a leading figure in the **Princeton Theology**, addressed the consequences of **original sin**—namely, **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death**—as central to the human condition after the Fall. He emphasized the **federal headship of Adam**, the imputation of guilt, the pervasive corruption of human nature, and the necessity of **redemption in Christ** to overcome these effects.

- "The race fell in Adam; and in Adam all men sinned, all men died, all men are involved in guilt and depravity." ("The Plan of Salvation")

- Selected Shorter Writings, Vol. 1

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Federal Headship and Imputation of Guilt**
    - Adam acted as the **representative head** of humanity in the covenant of works.
    - Adam’s first sin is **imputed** to all his descendants, resulting in universal guilt.
    - This imputation is legal and forensic, not merely moral or relational.
    - Warfield defends this doctrine as essential to **Reformed soteriology**.
    - "The sin of Adam is imputed to us, not as a matter of arbitrary arrangement, but because he was our natural and federal head." ("The Plan of Salvation")

2. **Total Depravity and Pollution of Nature**
    - Human nature is thoroughly corrupted as a result of the Fall.
    - This **pollution** affects every faculty: mind, will, and affections.
    - Warfield insists that this corruption is both inherited and actualized in personal sin.
    - The doctrine underscores the necessity of **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit.
    - "We are not sinners because we sin, but we sin because we are sinners." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Salvation")

3. **Death as the Judicial Penalty for Sin**
    - Physical, spiritual, and eternal death are the consequences of Adam’s transgression.
    - Death is not merely a natural process but a **judicial penalty** imposed by God.
    - Warfield connects the universality of death to the universality of guilt.
    - The resurrection of Christ is presented as the only hope for victory over death.
    - "Death is the wages of sin, and its universality is the proof of the universality of sin." ("The Plan of Salvation")

4. **Necessity of Substitutionary Atonement**
    - Only Christ’s **vicarious sacrifice** can remove guilt and pollution.
    - The atonement addresses both the legal and moral aspects of sin’s consequences.
    - Warfield upholds the necessity of both **justification** and **sanctification**.
    - The work of Christ is the ground for the believer’s deliverance from death.
    - "Christ’s death is the satisfaction of the law’s demands for us, and His life is the source of our new life." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

5. **Continuity with Reformed Confessional Standards**
    - Warfield aligns his doctrine with the **Westminster Confession of Faith**.
    - He defends the historic Reformed understanding of original sin against modern revisionism.
    - The categories of guilt, pollution, and death are maintained as essential to orthodox theology.
    - Warfield’s polemics reinforce the confessional boundaries of **Reformed orthodoxy**.
    - "The Westminster Confession is but the systematization of the teaching of the Scriptures themselves." ("The Westminster Assembly and Its Work")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **original sin** and its consequences—guilt, pollution, and death—remains foundational within confessional Reformed theology. His rigorous defense of **federal headship** and the necessity of Christ’s atonement shaped generations of theologians at Princeton and beyond. Warfield’s work continues to serve as a bulwark against both Pelagian and liberal reinterpretations of sin and salvation, ensuring the enduring relevance of classic Reformed categories in systematic theology.
