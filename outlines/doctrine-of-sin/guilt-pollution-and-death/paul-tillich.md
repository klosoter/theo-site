# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **guilt, pollution, and death** as existential realities rooted in the human condition of **estrangement** from the **Ground of Being**. He interpreted these categories not merely as moral or legal states, but as expressions of **existential anxiety** and **ontological separation** from God, which manifest in the experience of **sin** and the threat of **nonbeing**.

- "Guilt is the awareness of having violated the unity of one’s being by actualizing one’s potentiality in a way which contradicts the essential nature of being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Guilt as Existential Estrangement**
    - Guilt arises from the disruption of the essential unity between humanity and the **Ground of Being**.
    - It is not merely legal but existential, reflecting a broken relationship at the core of existence.
    - Guilt is universal, affecting all persons as part of the human predicament.
    - The experience of guilt is inseparable from the awareness of **sin** and **estrangement**.
    - "Guilt is the expression of man’s estrangement from his true being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Pollution as Ontological Corruption**
    - Pollution signifies the distortion and corruption of human nature due to separation from the divine source.
    - It is not simply ritual uncleanness but a state of existential impurity.
    - This condition affects both individual and collective existence.
    - Pollution is overcome only through **reconciliation** and participation in the **New Being**.
    - "Pollution is the state of being which is contrary to the essential nature of being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Death as Ultimate Threat of Nonbeing**
    - Death represents the final and most radical form of **nonbeing** confronting human existence.
    - It is both a physical and existential reality, intensifying the anxiety of finitude.
    - The fear of death underlies all other forms of existential anxiety.
    - Death is the symbol and consequence of humanity’s estrangement from the **Ground of Being**.
    - "Death is the boundary situation in which the threat of nonbeing becomes manifest." (The Courage to Be)

4. **Sin as the Root of Guilt, Pollution, and Death**
    - Sin is fundamentally **estrangement** from God, the source of all being and meaning.
    - It manifests in guilt (awareness of brokenness), pollution (state of corruption), and death (separation from life).
    - Sin is both personal and structural, affecting all aspects of existence.
    - The solution to sin is the **New Being** revealed in Christ, who reconciles humanity to God.
    - "Sin is separation; separation from the ground of our being, from other beings, and from ourselves." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Reconciliation through the New Being**
    - Reconciliation is the restoration of unity with the **Ground of Being** through the **New Being** in Christ.
    - It addresses guilt by offering acceptance, pollution by renewing being, and death by promising participation in eternal life.
    - The experience of grace overcomes existential anxiety and restores meaning.
    - Reconciliation is both an existential event and an ontological transformation.
    - "The New Being is the manifestation of the power of being which conquers the gap of estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential interpretation of **guilt, pollution, and death** has profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in the dialogue between theology and existential philosophy. His categories of **estrangement** and **nonbeing** have influenced both Christian and secular understandings of the human predicament. Tillich’s work continues to be a reference point for those seeking to articulate the relevance of Christian doctrine in a secular, psychologically aware age. His legacy endures in the ongoing conversation about the existential dimensions of **sin** and **redemption**.
