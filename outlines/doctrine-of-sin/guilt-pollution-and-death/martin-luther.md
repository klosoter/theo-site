# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of **guilt, pollution, and death** is rooted in his understanding of **original sin** and the radical corruption of human nature after the Fall. He emphasizes that all humanity is under the **condemnation** of God’s law, suffering both the **guilt** of Adam’s transgression and the ongoing **pollution** of sin, which inevitably leads to **spiritual and physical death** apart from the justifying work of Christ.

- "Original sin is not a slight, but so deep a corruption of human nature that no reason can understand it; it must be believed because of the revelation in the Scriptures." (Large Catechism)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- Commentary on Romans (1515–1516)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Large Catechism (1529)
- Lectures on Genesis (1535–1545)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Total Corruption**
    - Humanity inherits both the **guilt** and **pollution** of Adam’s first sin.
    - Sin is not merely an act but a pervasive condition affecting the whole person.
    - The will, intellect, and affections are all corrupted and turned away from God.
    - This corruption is the root cause of both spiritual and physical **death**.
    - "All men are full of evil lust and inclination from their mothers’ wombs." (Large Catechism)

2. **Guilt Before the Law**
    - The law of God exposes human **guilt** and incapacity to fulfill its demands.
    - Guilt is both inherited and actual, rendering all people liable to divine judgment.
    - The conscience is burdened and accused by the law, driving sinners to despair.
    - Only the **righteousness of Christ** can remove this guilt.
    - "The Law says, ‘Do this,’ and it is never done. Grace says, ‘Believe in this,’ and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

3. **Pollution and Bondage of the Will**
    - Sin’s pollution enslaves the will, making true obedience impossible apart from grace.
    - The human heart is fundamentally turned inward (incurvatus in se).
    - Even good works are tainted by sinful motives and cannot merit favor before God.
    - Regeneration is necessary to begin true sanctification and renewal.
    - "Free will after the fall exists in name only, and as long as it does what it is able, it commits a mortal sin." (Bondage of the Will)

4. **Death as the Wages of Sin**
    - Physical and spiritual **death** are the direct consequences of sin.
    - Death is both a penalty and a sign of humanity’s alienation from God.
    - Christ’s death and resurrection are the only remedy for the curse of death.
    - Believers still experience physical death, but its sting is removed in Christ.
    - "Death is nothing else than the wrath of God, the end and punishment of sin." (Lectures on Genesis)

5. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is God’s gracious act of declaring sinners righteous through faith in Christ.
    - The guilt and pollution of sin are imputed to Christ, while His righteousness is imputed to believers.
    - This forensic declaration is the only escape from the condemnation of guilt and death.
    - Sanctification follows justification but does not contribute to the removal of guilt.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, apart from works of the law." (Romans Commentary)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s articulation of **original sin**, guilt, and death profoundly shaped Protestant understandings of human depravity and the necessity of **justification by faith alone**. His emphasis on the pervasive pollution of sin and the utter inability of the will apart from grace became foundational for later Reformed and Lutheran theology. Luther’s insights continue to inform debates on the nature of sin, the human condition, and the radical need for redemption in Christ.
