# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner addressed **guilt, pollution, and death** within the framework of **human sinfulness** and **alienation from God**, emphasizing the existential and relational rupture caused by sin. He viewed these realities not merely as legal or ontological states, but as manifestations of humanity’s broken relationship with God, which only **divine grace** in Christ can restore. Brunner’s approach is marked by a strong focus on **personal encounter**, **responsibility**, and the necessity of **reconciliation**.

- "Sin is not merely a defect or a lack, but a positive turning away from God, a rebellion which brings guilt and death." (Man in Revolt)

## Key Works

- Man in Revolt (Der Mensch im Widerspruch)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Dogmatics, Vol. 2: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Personal Rebellion**
    - Sin is fundamentally a **personal act of rebellion** against God, not just a violation of law.
    - **Guilt** arises from this willful estrangement, making the sinner responsible before God.
    - **Pollution** is the existential distortion of human nature resulting from this rebellion.
    - **Death** is both a physical and spiritual consequence, signifying separation from the source of life.
    - "Sin is not a thing, but an act; not a substance, but a relation." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Guilt as Relational Estrangement**
    - **Guilt** is rooted in the broken relationship between humanity and God.
    - It is not merely a legal status but an existential reality affecting the whole person.
    - True guilt cannot be removed by human effort or psychological means.
    - Only **divine forgiveness** can address the depth of human guilt.
    - "Guilt is the shadow cast by man’s freedom in the presence of God." (Man in Revolt)

3. **Pollution as Corruption of the Image of God**
    - Sin leads to the **corruption of the imago Dei** in humanity.
    - This **pollution** affects every aspect of human existence—mind, will, and affections.
    - The distortion is not absolute; the image remains but is marred.
    - Restoration is possible only through **reconciliation in Christ**.
    - "The image of God is not destroyed, but it is distorted and corrupted by sin." (Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

4. **Death as the Ultimate Consequence of Sin**
    - **Death** is both a natural and spiritual reality resulting from sin.
    - It signifies the final separation from God, the giver of life.
    - Human attempts to overcome death are futile apart from divine intervention.
    - **Resurrection** is the only true answer to the problem of death.
    - "Death is the sign and seal of man’s separation from God." (The Mediator)

5. **Necessity of Divine Grace for Restoration**
    - Human beings cannot overcome **guilt, pollution, and death** by their own power.
    - Only the **grace of God** in Jesus Christ can restore the broken relationship.
    - The **cross and resurrection** are central to the removal of guilt and the defeat of death.
    - Reconciliation is a personal encounter with God’s forgiving love.
    - "Only he who is forgiven can live; only he who is reconciled can overcome death." (Truth as Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s existential and relational approach to **guilt, pollution, and death** influenced 20th-century Protestant theology, especially in the context of the **dialectical theology** movement. His emphasis on the personal and relational dimensions of sin and redemption provided a counterpoint to more forensic or ontological models. Brunner’s work continues to shape discussions on the nature of **sin**, **human responsibility**, and the necessity of **divine grace** for true reconciliation and restoration.
