# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a rigorous account of **original sin** and its consequences: **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death**. He maintained that Adam’s first transgression imputed both **forensic guilt** and a **corrupted nature** to all his descendants, resulting in both legal condemnation and existential depravity, culminating in **spiritual and physical death**. Turretin’s careful distinctions shaped later Reformed understandings of the human condition after the Fall.

- "Original sin is both the imputation of Adam’s guilt and the inherent corruption of nature, from which death necessarily follows." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, IX.7.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Topics VIII–X)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on the Doctrine of Sin (various disputations)
- Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Both Guilt and Pollution**
    - Adam’s sin is imputed to all his posterity, resulting in **forensic guilt**.
    - Human nature is also inherently corrupted, producing **moral pollution**.
    - Both aspects are inseparable and constitute the full reality of original sin.
    - This duality grounds the necessity of **regeneration** and **justification**.
    - "Original sin is twofold: the imputation of Adam’s first sin and the habitual corruption of our nature." (Institutes IX.7.1)

2. **Imputation of Adam’s Guilt**
    - All humans are represented by Adam as their **federal head**.
    - Adam’s act is legally reckoned to his descendants, resulting in condemnation.
    - This imputation is immediate and precedes any personal act of sin.
    - The **covenant of works** framework undergirds this legal solidarity.
    - "The guilt of Adam’s sin is imputed to us because he was the covenant head of the human race." (Institutes IX.9.2)

3. **Inherent Corruption (Pollution) of Nature**
    - Beyond guilt, all humans inherit a depraved nature from Adam.
    - This **pollution** affects every faculty: mind, will, and affections.
    - It renders humanity incapable of true spiritual good apart from grace.
    - Pollution is not merely privation but a positive inclination toward evil.
    - "The corruption of nature is not only the loss of original righteousness, but also a propensity to all evil." (Institutes IX.11.2)

4. **Death as the Penalty for Sin**
    - **Death** is threefold: spiritual, physical, and eternal.
    - Spiritual death is the loss of communion with God.
    - Physical death is the dissolution of body and soul.
    - Eternal death is everlasting separation from God for the unredeemed.
    - "Death, both temporal and eternal, is the just punishment of sin." (Institutes IX.12.1)

5. **Necessity of Redemption in Christ**
    - Only Christ’s **active and passive obedience** can remove both guilt and pollution.
    - Justification addresses guilt; **sanctification** addresses pollution.
    - The work of Christ restores life where death reigned.
    - Union with Christ is essential for the reversal of Adamic consequences.
    - "Christ is the second Adam, who takes away both the guilt and the pollution of sin." (Institutes IX.13.4)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s precise distinctions between **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** became foundational for later Reformed theology, especially in debates over the nature of original sin and the necessity of Christ’s redemptive work. His articulation of the **federal headship** of Adam and the dual aspect of original sin influenced confessional documents and systematic theologians for centuries. Turretin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on both the legal and existential dimensions of humanity’s fallen state.
