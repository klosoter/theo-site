# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **guilt, pollution, and death** through the lens of **existentialist interpretation** and **demythologization**. He saw these realities not as ontological states inherited from Adam, but as existential conditions describing humanity’s alienation from **authentic existence** and God. For Bultmann, the New Testament’s language of sin and death must be reinterpreted to address the modern individual’s experience of **estrangement** and the call to **faith**.

- "The real meaning of death is that it reveals man’s existence as inauthentic, as existence in sin." (Existence and Faith)

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (in Kerygma and Myth)
- Theology of the New Testament (2 vols.)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann
- Faith and Understanding

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Sin and Death**
    - Interprets biblical language of **guilt** and **death** as mythological expressions of existential realities.
    - Rejects a literal, inherited **original sin** in favor of understanding sin as alienation from authentic selfhood.
    - Views **pollution** as symbolic of the human condition of estrangement, not a metaphysical stain.
    - Sees the New Testament’s apocalyptic imagery as existential metaphor.
    - "Myth speaks of the other-worldly in terms of this world, and of the divine in terms of human life." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Understanding of Guilt**
    - Guilt is the awareness of one’s own inauthentic existence before God.
    - It is not a legal status but an existential self-realization.
    - The experience of guilt drives the individual to seek **faith** and transformation.
    - Guilt is overcome not by ritual, but by existential decision.
    - "Guilt is not a state but an event in which man becomes aware of himself as estranged from God." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Death as the Ultimate Threat to Authentic Existence**
    - Death exposes the futility of self-reliance and the limits of human autonomy.
    - It is the existential boundary that reveals the need for **faith**.
    - The fear of death is tied to the refusal to entrust oneself to God.
    - Resurrection is not a historical event but a proclamation of new existence.
    - "Death is the supreme manifestation of man’s lostness and his need for salvation." (Existence and Faith)

4. **Faith as the Solution to Estrangement**
    - Faith is an existential act of trust in God’s word, not assent to doctrine.
    - Through faith, the individual is liberated from guilt and fear of death.
    - Faith enables authentic existence in the present, not just hope for the afterlife.
    - The proclamation (kerygma) calls for existential decision.
    - "Faith is the surrender of the self to God’s grace, which alone overcomes guilt and death." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Rejection of Objective Pollution**
    - Pollution is not a metaphysical or ritual impurity, but a metaphor for existential alienation.
    - The New Testament’s purity laws are reinterpreted as symbols of the human condition.
    - True cleansing comes through existential encounter with the word of God.
    - The church’s task is to proclaim liberation from existential pollution, not to administer ritual purity.
    - "The concept of impurity is meaningful only as a symbol of man’s self-estrangement." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential reinterpretation of **guilt, pollution, and death** profoundly shaped modern **New Testament theology** and the trajectory of **demythologization**. His approach challenged traditional doctrines of **original sin** and **death** as inherited realities, instead emphasizing existential decision and authentic existence. While controversial, his work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relevance of biblical language in a secular age and the ongoing dialogue between theology and existential philosophy.
