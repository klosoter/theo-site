# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a comprehensive doctrine of **original sin**, emphasizing its effects as **guilt**, **pollution** (the disordering of human nature), and **death** (both physical and spiritual). He maintained that through Adam's transgression, all humanity inherits a privation of original righteousness, resulting in a state of **culpability**, a corruption of the will, and subjection to mortality.

- "By the sin of our first parent, the nature was corrupted and deprived of original justice, and this privation is called the guilt of original sin." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 82, a. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Privation of Original Justice**
    - Original sin is not a positive substance but the loss of **original righteousness**.
    - This privation leaves the will disordered and the soul inclined toward sin.
    - All descendants of Adam inherit this state by propagation, not imitation.
    - The guilt of original sin is universal and necessitates divine grace for restoration.
    - "Original sin is called sin not as having the nature of an act, but as having the nature of a habit." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 82, a. 1)

2. **Guilt as Liability to Punishment**
    - Guilt is the juridical aspect of original sin, making all humans liable before God.
    - It is transmitted with human nature, not through personal acts.
    - The removal of guilt requires the application of **Christ’s merits** through the sacraments.
    - Guilt is distinct from concupiscence, though both arise from original sin.
    - "The guilt of original sin is taken away by baptism, but the fomes of sin remains." (Summa Theologiae III, Q. 69, a. 3)

3. **Pollution as Disordered Concupiscence**
    - Pollution refers to the corruption of human faculties, especially the will and passions.
    - This disorder is called **concupiscence**, an inclination toward sin.
    - Even after baptism, the pollution (fomes peccati) remains as a test and for spiritual struggle.
    - Pollution is not itself sin after baptism, but an occasion for actual sin.
    - "Concupiscence remains after baptism, not as guilt, but as an inclination." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 82, a. 3)

4. **Death as the Penalty of Sin**
    - Physical death entered the world as a direct consequence of Adam’s sin.
    - Spiritual death, or the loss of communion with God, is the deeper penalty.
    - Death is both a punishment and a means by which God brings about justice.
    - The resurrection of Christ overcomes death for the redeemed, restoring hope.
    - "Death and all the defects of the body are the result of the loss of original justice." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 85, a. 5)

5. **Necessity of Grace for Restoration**
    - Human nature, corrupted by guilt and pollution, cannot heal itself.
    - Only **sanctifying grace** can remove guilt and begin the renewal of the soul.
    - The sacraments, especially baptism, are the ordinary means of grace’s application.
    - Grace does not destroy nature but perfects and heals it.
    - "Grace is given to us for the remission of guilt and the healing of nature." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 109, a. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **original sin** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, providing a systematic account of how guilt, pollution, and death are interrelated consequences of the Fall. His distinction between the juridical (guilt) and ontological (pollution) effects of sin influenced both Roman Catholic and Protestant theology. The Thomistic synthesis remains foundational for discussions of **human nature**, the necessity of grace, and the meaning of redemption. His careful articulation of these categories continues to inform contemporary debates on sin and salvation.
