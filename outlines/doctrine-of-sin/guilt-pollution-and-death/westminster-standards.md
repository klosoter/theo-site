# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a comprehensive doctrine of **sin** that encompasses **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** as consequences of Adam’s fall. These documents emphasize the **federal headship of Adam**, the imputation of **original sin**, and the pervasive corruption affecting all humanity, resulting in both **legal condemnation** and **spiritual death**.

- "Every sin, both original and actual, being a transgression of the righteous law of God, and contrary thereunto, doth, in its own nature, bring guilt upon the sinner..." (Westminster Confession of Faith 6.6)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 6, 9, 11)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 22–29, 149–152)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 13–19)
- A. A. Hodge, "The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine"
- Chad Van Dixhoorn, "Confessing the Faith: A Reader’s Guide to the Westminster Confession of Faith"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Guilt as Forensic Liability**
    - Guilt is defined as the sinner’s **legal liability** to the **justice of God**.
    - Adam’s first sin is **imputed** to all his posterity, rendering all guilty before God.
    - Guilt results in the **loss of communion with God** and exposure to His wrath.
    - The Standards distinguish between **original guilt** (from Adam) and **actual guilt** (from personal sins).
    - "They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed..." (WCF 6.3)

2. **Pollution as Inherited Corruption**
    - Pollution refers to the **corruption of nature** inherited from Adam.
    - All faculties of the soul are defiled, making humans **utterly indisposed** to good.
    - This corruption is both **total** (affecting every part) and **perpetual** (remaining in the regenerate).
    - Pollution produces actual sins and is itself deserving of condemnation.
    - "From this original corruption...do proceed all actual transgressions." (WCF 6.4)

3. **Death as Judicial Penalty**
    - Death is the **wages of sin** and includes physical, spiritual, and eternal aspects.
    - Physical death is the separation of body and soul; spiritual death is alienation from God.
    - Eternal death is the final consequence for the unredeemed, described as **everlasting destruction**.
    - The Standards teach that death entered the world through Adam’s transgression.
    - "By this they fell from their original righteousness and communion with God, and so became dead in sin..." (WCF 6.2)

4. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam acted as the **federal representative** of humanity in the covenant of works.
    - His guilt and corruption are **imputed** to all his descendants.
    - The Standards stress the parallel between Adam and Christ as federal heads.
    - This doctrine undergirds the necessity of **justification by faith** in Christ’s righteousness.
    - "The covenant being made with Adam...not for himself only, but for his posterity..." (WCF 7.2)

5. **Necessity of Redemption**
    - Humanity’s state of guilt, pollution, and death necessitates **redemption through Christ**.
    - Only Christ’s atoning work can remove guilt, cleanse pollution, and conquer death.
    - The Standards connect the application of redemption to the work of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Justification, sanctification, and glorification address the threefold problem of sin.
    - "Those whom God effectually calleth, he also freely justifieth..." (WCF 11.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on the doctrines of sin and salvation, providing a precise vocabulary for discussing **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death**. Their articulation of **federal headship** and the threefold consequence of sin remains foundational for Presbyterian and confessional Reformed churches worldwide. The Standards continue to inform theological education, pastoral ministry, and ecumenical dialogue on the nature of human depravity and the necessity of grace.
