# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **guilt, pollution, and death** through the lens of **Reformed anthropology** and **covenant theology**, emphasizing their roots in the **fall of Adam** and their remedy in **redemption accomplished by Christ**. He integrates these categories within his **triperspectivalism**, showing how each aspect is related to the **law of God**, the **corruption of human nature**, and the **penalty of sin**.

- "Sin brings guilt, pollution, and death, and only the grace of God in Christ can deliver us from all three." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord: An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Doctrine of the Word of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Guilt as Forensic Condemnation**
   - Guilt is the objective liability to **God’s judgment** resulting from violation of his law.
   - It is rooted in **Adam’s federal headship**, imputed to all humanity.
   - The **law perspective** highlights guilt as a breach of God’s covenant standard.
   - Justification in Christ removes guilt by satisfying divine justice.
   - "Guilt is the liability to punishment, the judicial consequence of sin." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Pollution as Moral Corruption**
   - Pollution refers to the **corruption of human nature** inherited from Adam.
   - It affects every aspect of the person: mind, will, and affections.
   - The **existential perspective** reveals pollution as the distortion of the image of God.
   - Sanctification addresses pollution by renewing believers in holiness.
   - "Pollution is the corruption of our nature, making us unable to please God." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Death as Covenant Penalty**
   - Death is the **penal consequence** of sin, encompassing physical, spiritual, and eternal dimensions.
   - It signifies separation from God, the source of life.
   - The **situational perspective** sees death as the outworking of God’s curse in history.
   - Christ’s resurrection is the definitive victory over death for believers.
   - "Death is the penalty God threatened for sin, and it comes in physical, spiritual, and eternal forms." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Triperspectival Integration**
   - Guilt, pollution, and death are understood through **normative (law), existential (person), and situational (history)** perspectives.
   - Each perspective illuminates a different facet of the human predicament.
   - Redemption in Christ addresses all three aspects comprehensively.
   - This integration guards against reductionism in understanding sin and salvation.
   - "Each of these aspects—guilt, pollution, and death—must be seen in light of God’s law, our personal condition, and our historical situation." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Redemption as Comprehensive Deliverance**
   - Christ’s work removes guilt (justification), cleanses pollution (sanctification), and conquers death (glorification).
   - Salvation is holistic, addressing the full scope of sin’s effects.
   - The application of redemption is by the Holy Spirit, uniting believers to Christ.
   - Assurance rests in the sufficiency of Christ’s person and work for all dimensions of the fall.
   - "In Christ, we are freed from guilt, cleansed from pollution, and given victory over death." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s articulation of **guilt, pollution, and death** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology by emphasizing the comprehensive nature of sin and salvation. His **triperspectival approach** offers a nuanced framework for understanding the human condition and the work of Christ. Frame’s influence is evident in both academic and pastoral contexts, equipping theologians and church leaders to address the depth of human need and the sufficiency of redemption in Christ.
