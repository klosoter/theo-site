### ESSAY
To speak rigorously of **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** is to articulate the inner grammar of the Christian doctrine of sin and its miseries. The Reformed confessional tradition, following Augustine, characteristically describes the human condition after the fall as one of **liability to punishment** before God, an inwardly disordered nature that is both culpable and enslaved, and a threefold death that is spiritual, physical, and eternal. The candidate must hold these together without collapsing guilt into mere subjective feeling, pollution into mere legal status, or death into a merely natural process. At stake is the coherence of **original sin**, the necessity and nature of the atonement, and the structure of salvation as both justification and sanctification under **federal headship**.

Augustine is the decisive point of departure. In his anti-Pelagian works, especially Against Julian, On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins and On the Spirit and the Letter, Augustine forged the Western grammar that binds **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** into one ordered reality. For Augustine, Adam is the root and head of the human race: in him, all have sinned. The fall brings not only bad example or an external wound, but a real **reatus culpae**, a guilt of fault, and a consequent **reatus poenae**, a guilt of punishment. This double reatus is critical. Adam’s sin renders humanity liable to divine judgment and simultaneously passes on a vitiated nature characterized by concupiscence and an inward curving of the will. The infant, though personally without actual transgression, already bears both the inherited fault and corruption. Hence the necessity of infant baptism for Augustine: it is not a sentimental rite but a sacramental dealing with real guilt and pollution.

Augustine thereby unites the legal and ontological dimensions of sin. **Guilt** names the relation of the person, in Adam, to the law and justice of God. **Pollution** names the internal disarray of the person’s loves and powers, a deformation of the imago Dei that is both punishment and sinfulness. **Death** then is not a neutral biological fact but the just sanction of God against this guilty and polluted race: spiritual death as alienation from God, bodily death as dissolution, and the second death as eternal separation. An examiner pressing the candidate might ask whether Augustine confuses guilt and pollution by treating concupiscence itself as sinful. The Augustinian reply must be that for a rational creature made for ordered love, the inward inclination contrary to God is itself culpable; there is no neutral middle between righteousness and sin. Concupiscence as a movement of the heart away from God is already **moral evil**, not merely occasion for evil.

Anselm deepens Augustine’s juridical insight and sharpens the notion of **guilt** in Cur Deus Homo. For Anselm, sin is a failure to render God his due honor, creating a debtor’s relation between humanity and God’s justice. **Guilt** is this lack of rectitude, this deprivation that demands satisfaction. Without adequate satisfaction or punishment, the order of justice is violated. While Anselm does not offer a fully developed doctrine of original sin in federal terms, his careful distinctions shape later thinking: guilt is not a subjective feeling, but an objective standing as one who has withheld what is owed. Pollution, by contrast, is implied but not central in Anselm’s argument. The polluted will is unable to pay the debt of honor, but the chief emphasis falls on the necessity of a God-man whose obedience and passion can provide supererogatory satisfaction for the guilt of many.

Here a likely objection emerges: does Anselm risk reducing sin to a commercial deficit and neglect the depth of inner corruption? This is where the Reformed reception, especially in Calvin and Owen, must integrate Anselm’s forensic precision with an Augustinian ontology of sin. The candidate must insist that the Anselmian line is not a rival to Augustine but a specification of the legal dimension that already operates in Augustine’s distinction between the guilt of fault and the guilt of punishment. Anselm’s stress on the necessity of satisfaction for guilt becomes one pillar of the later doctrine of **penal substitution**, which is unintelligible if guilt is collapsed into psychological shame or cultural stigma.

John Calvin stands at the intersection of patristic Augustinianism, Anselmian satisfaction, and emerging **federal theology**. His Institutes and his commentaries offer a compact yet powerful articulation of **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** as mutually informing realities under the covenant of works and grace. For Calvin, Adam is not merely the first sinner but the representative head whose disobedience is imputed to his posterity. Thus Calvin can say that all are born bearing **original guilt**, liable to condemnation before they perform any actual transgression. Simultaneously, all are born with **original pollution**, which he often calls depravity or corruption, an inherited disposition that inclines to all evil. Calvin echoes Augustine: the will is not coerced from without but enslaved from within; the mind is darkened; affections are disordered. This pollution is not a metaphysical substance but a moral-spiritual disfigurement pervading the faculties.

What is crucial is that Calvin refuses to rank guilt and pollution as sequential stages, as if we were first guilty and then polluted or vice versa. Rather, guilt and pollution are distinct yet inseparable aspects of the one reality of original sin. To deny inherited guilt while affirming pollution is to sever the covenantal and representative structure of the race and to make death appear disproportionate to mere weakness. To deny pollution while affirming guilt is to turn justification into a mere legal fiction with no need for regeneration and sanctification. Calvin’s emphasis on union with Christ draws the two back together: in Christ’s death, the guilt of sin is borne and removed; in Christ’s resurrection and the gift of the Spirit, the pollution of sin begins to be cleansed. Thus **justification** and **sanctification** are distinct but inseparable benefits, answering respectively to guilt and pollution, and together overcoming death in all its aspects.

John Owen extends and systematizes this Calvinian inheritance with scholastic precision. In works like The Mortification of Sin and The Death of Death in the Death of Christ, Owen treats pollution not simply as a static depravity but as active indwelling sin, a law of sin in the members that wages war against the law of the mind. Pollution is dynamic. It produces particular lusts, habits, and patterns of disobedience that demand ongoing mortification and vivification. Yet Owen never allows this robust account of inward sin to float free from its forensic ground. The efficacy of mortification derives from union with Christ crucified and risen, presupposing that the believer’s guilt has been fully borne and punished in the substitute. This is where Owen’s development of **penal substitution** crystallizes Augustine and Anselm: the believer’s guilt is not ignored or dissolved; it is imputed to Christ, who endures the curse of the law and the depths of **death** as covenantal sanction. Only on that basis can the Spirit progressively cleanse pollution.

Here internal Reformed debates emerge. Some, influenced by a more voluntarist reading of divine law, have tended to define guilt almost entirely in terms of positive law without rooting it in the moral order of creation. Others, reacting to legalism, have pushed toward defining sin primarily as broken relationship and pollution. The candidate must argue, with Owen and later Bavinck, that both tendencies are reductionist. **Guilt** is indeed covenantally and legally defined, but the law itself is an expression of God’s holy nature and the created moral order. Likewise **pollution** is relational and affective, but it is also concretely lawless and therefore always involves **guilt**. There is no relational rupture that is not also juridical, because God is the righteous judge, and no juridical status that is not relational, because God is not an impersonal lawgiver but the triune Lord of the covenant.

Herman Bavinck, finally, offers a mature synthesis in Reformed Dogmatics. He presents **original sin** as consisting of both **original guilt** and **original pollution**, each irreducible, mutually interpreting, and transmitted within the organic unity of the race under Adamic headship. Bavinck highlights the organism of humanity: Adam is not merely an external representative but the root from which the whole tree grows. Thus both guilt and pollution are transmitted not by crude biological mechanism, nor by mere imitation, but by the covenantal and organic solidarity of the human race. Bavinck is sensitive to Eastern Orthodox critiques, which often claim that the Western tradition overemphasizes guilt and legal categories at the expense of corruption and death. He responds by showing that Western theology, at its best, never separated these. For Bavinck, the essence of death is not simply physical cessation but exclusion from communion with the living God. The reign of death over humanity presupposes a prior **guilt** incurred in Adam and presently ratified by each person’s actual sins, and it is inhabited and perpetuated by the inward **pollution** of the nature.

This points toward key external debates. Pelagian and semi-Pelagian positions deny or attenuate inherited guilt. They may concede some form of weakened nature or adverse environment but reject the idea that all are born truly guilty before God. The examiner might ask why such a position is inadequate if it preserves human responsibility for actual sins. The Augustinian–Reformed response is that Scripture and experience testify that death reigns over infants and that the universality and inevitability of sin cannot be accounted for by environment alone. More fundamentally, any account that limits guilt to the product of discrete voluntary acts ignores the corporate and covenantal dimension of biblical anthropology. Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 speak of humanity as genuinely involved in Adam’s act. To deny **original guilt** is in effect to deny that God’s dealings with humanity are structured by **federal headship**, which in turn undermines the parallel structure in Christ. If we are unwilling to be condemned in another, on what grounds can we be justified in another.

Eastern Orthodox theologians often prefer to speak of ancestral sin largely in terms of **pollution** and **death** without fully endorsing inherited guilt. This raises serious ecumenical questions. Are we bound to Western categories. The Reformed candidate can acknowledge valuable emphases in Oriental accounts, such as the centrality of death and corruption as enemies defeated by Christ’s resurrection, while still insisting that the biblical witness cannot be rendered without **guilt**. The language of curse, wrath, and judgment, as well as the logic of the sacrificial system and the cross, presupposes not only an ontological disease but a judicial liability. To say that humanity is only sick and not also condemned distorts the necessity and nature of the atonement. The cure accomplished by Christ is not only healing but also satisfaction of divine justice.

Modern secular and existential critiques further pressure the doctrine. Freudian and post-Freudian therapies often recast guilt as neurotic residue of oppressive authority, to be overcome for psychic health. Critical theorists speak of guilt in structural and social terms, as complicity in systems of domination, without reference to a personal God or eternal law. Modern liberal theology, influenced by Schleiermacher, has tended to internalize sin as a consciousness of dependence or as societal brokenness, sidelining forensic categories. These moves resonate with deep truths: that humans experience shame, that structures can be unjust, that guilt-feelings can be disordered and oppressive. But as a theological account of **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** they fail, because they either psychologize or sociologize what is first of all a Godward reality. One may have intense guilt-feelings without being guilty in God’s sight, and one may be truly guilty before God without any conscious guilt-feeling. Likewise, societal injustices are real expressions of pollution, but they are rooted in and intensify a prior, deeper **guilt** before the holy God.

Contemporary debates around trauma, victimhood, and structural sin raise a subtle but important challenge. How can we speak of universal guilt without erasing the distinction between victims and perpetrators. The answer requires the careful use of categories: as descendants of Adam, all humans share in **original guilt** and **pollution** and are subject to **death** as covenantal sanction; but within that fallen order, there remain genuine asymmetries of responsibility for concrete evils. The abused child is truly a sinner in Adam, but in the particular abuse she is a victim, not a perpetrator. Recognizing original guilt does not legitimate oppression; instead, it explains why even victims are not morally pure and why cycles of abuse and injustice perpetuate. It also grounds the hope that God’s eschatological judgment will finally and justly distinguish all acts within the shared fallen condition.

Another contemporary pressure point concerns biological death and evolution. If physical death is present in nonhuman creatures prior to human sin, can we still speak of death as the wages of sin. The classic Augustinian–Reformed position, which the candidate should defend, is that Paul is speaking specifically of human death in covenant relation with God. Nonhuman mortality may have existed in the good created order as part of creaturely finitude. The entrance of sin introduces a new mode of **death** for humans as a covenant sanction: not mere biological cessation but death under wrath, interpreted within a judicial and relational framework. To preserve the biblical connection between sin and death, we must insist that human death, including bodily death, is unnatural relative to God’s original intention for Adam under the covenant of works. It is precisely this covenantal death that Christ bears and overcomes.

All of this converges on the soteriological question: how does Christ deal with **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death**. Here the contributions of Augustine, Anselm, Calvin, Owen, and Bavinck converge. Christ as the second Adam bears the **guilt** of his people by **imputation**. In his obedient life and atoning death, he satisfies divine justice, enduring the curse and the full dimensions of death: the dereliction of the cross as spiritual death, the separation of soul and body in burial, the bearing of divine wrath that anticipates the second death. This is the core of **penal substitution**, without which justification by faith alone loses its anchor. Simultaneously, Christ assumes our polluted nature without sin and, through his resurrection and the gift of the Spirit, begins the restoration of that nature. Believers are united to him so that pollution is progressively conquered: the mind is renewed, affections are reordered, the body is destined for glorification. Finally, Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the abolition of **death** itself as the last enemy, securing future bodily resurrection and the removal of every vestige of pollution from soul and body.

An examiner may press whether this threefold account risks fragmenting salvation. Are we positing three different problems and three loosely related solutions. The answer must be that **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** are analytically distinct but historically and theologically inseparable aspects of one plight whose resolution is one unified work of the triune God. Justification, sanctification, and glorification are not separate salvations but different aspects of one salvation as it addresses different aspects of our misery. The same union with Christ by the Spirit places us in a new legal standing, initiates a new ontological reality, and guarantees a new eschatological destiny. To collapse these aspects would produce either antinomianism, if guilt is forgiven without pollution being cleansed, or moralism, if pollution is addressed without full removal of guilt.

Finally, the doctrine of **guilt**, **pollution**, and **death** serves as a hermeneutical control across loci. It guards the doctrine of God from being turned into a mere therapeutic principle. If human guilt is real, then God’s **justice** and **holiness** are not optional attributes but structural to the gospel. It shapes Christology: only a true God-man can bear real guilt and heal real pollution. It governs ecclesiology and the means of grace: the preaching of the law and the gospel must reckon with both the forensic and the transformative dimensions of salvation, addressing the conscience and the whole person. And it grounds eschatology: final judgment and the new creation are the climactic resolution of guilt, pollution, and death, as the wicked bear their own guilt and pollution eternally while the redeemed stand justified, fully purified, and immortal.

The candidate, then, should own and defend a robust Augustinian–Reformed account in which **guilt** is the objective liability of all humans in Adam and in their own sins before the holy God, **pollution** is the inherited and active corruption of nature that enslaves and defiles, and **death** is the covenantal curse embracing spiritual, bodily, and eternal dimensions. This threefold misery is grounded in **federal headship** and organically transmitted in the human race. In Christ, by **penal substitutionary atonement**, regenerative cleansing, and resurrection power, this entire misery is decisively and comprehensively overcome. Any attempt to relieve present tensions by minimizing guilt, redefining pollution as mere woundedness, or treating death as natural undermines the coherence of the gospel and the glory of the triune God who justifies the ungodly, purifies the unclean, and raises the dead.

- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:  
  - How do you distinguish guilt from pollution without separating them. → Guilt is legal liability before God’s law, pollution is inward corruption of nature; they are distinct aspects of one fallen condition grounded in Adamic headship.  
  - Why insist on original guilt rather than only corruption. → Because Scripture ties universal death and condemnation to Adam’s one sin and because federal headship in Adam undergirds our salvation in Christ.  
  - How does your view answer the charge that God punishes the innocent. → No one is metaphysically innocent in Adam; humanity is a real organic and covenantal unity in its first head, so condemnation is just and parallel to gracious justification in Christ.  
  - Does this doctrine erase the difference between victims and perpetrators. → No, all share original guilt and pollution, but concrete acts still differ in responsibility and God’s final judgment will perfectly distinguish them.  
  - How does Christ’s work map onto guilt, pollution, and death. → His atoning death removes guilt, his risen life and Spirit cleanse pollution, and his resurrection and return abolish death in all its forms.
