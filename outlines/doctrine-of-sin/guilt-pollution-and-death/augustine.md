# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **guilt, pollution, and death** is foundational for Western theology, centering on the consequences of **original sin**. He teaches that all humanity inherits both the **guilt** and **corruption** of Adam, resulting in universal **spiritual death** and the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation.

- "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." (Confessions)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, and on the Baptism of Infants
- City of God
- On Nature and Grace
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Inherited Guilt**
    - Humanity is united in Adam, so his sin is imputed to all.
    - All are born under the **condemnation** of Adam’s transgression.
    - Infants, though personally innocent, are still guilty before God.
    - This inherited guilt necessitates **redemption** through Christ.
    - "All men were in that one man, since all men were that one man who fell into sin by the woman who was made from him before sin." (City of God)

2. **Pollution as Corruption of Nature**
    - Sin not only brings guilt but also corrupts human nature.
    - The will is enslaved to sin, unable to choose true good without grace.
    - This corruption is transmitted through natural generation.
    - Human faculties—mind, will, affections—are all disordered.
    - "The punishment, therefore, of sin is sin." (Enchiridion)

3. **Death as the Penalty for Sin**
    - Physical death enters the world as a direct result of Adam’s sin.
    - Spiritual death—alienation from God—is the deeper reality.
    - Eternal death (damnation) is the ultimate consequence apart from grace.
    - Death is both a just penalty and a means of divine judgment.
    - "For the soul, which has turned away from God, is dead in proportion as it is thus turned away." (City of God)

4. **Necessity of Divine Grace**
    - Human beings cannot free themselves from guilt or corruption.
    - **Grace** is absolutely necessary for regeneration and salvation.
    - God’s grace is both prevenient (preparing) and efficacious (accomplishing).
    - Even the will to believe is a gift of grace, not a human achievement.
    - "For it is by grace you are saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God." (On Nature and Grace)

5. **Baptism and the Removal of Guilt**
    - Baptism is the ordinary means by which original guilt is remitted.
    - Even infants require baptism due to inherited sin.
    - Baptism initiates the process of sanctification, though corruption remains.
    - The sacrament is a sign and means of incorporation into Christ.
    - "The guilt of original sin is remitted in the sacrament of baptism." (On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **original sin** profoundly shaped both Western Catholic and Protestant traditions, influencing doctrines of **human depravity**, **grace**, and **salvation**. His views on guilt, pollution, and death became the standard for medieval theology and were central to the Reformation debates. The Augustinian framework remains a touchstone for discussions of human nature and the necessity of grace in overcoming sin’s effects.
