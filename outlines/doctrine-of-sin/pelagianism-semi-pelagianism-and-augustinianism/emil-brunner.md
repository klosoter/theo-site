# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the controversies of **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism** through his mediating position within **dialectical theology**. He rejected both the radical optimism of Pelagianism and the deterministic tendencies of strict Augustinianism, emphasizing the necessity of **divine grace** while affirming a real, though limited, human response. Brunner’s theology sought to uphold the seriousness of **sin** and the priority of **God’s initiative** in salvation, yet he maintained a relational view of the human will.

- "Grace does not destroy nature, but restores it; it does not abolish the will, but sets it free." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God: Dogmatics, Volume I
- Man in Revolt
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Nature and Grace: A Discussion with Karl Barth
- Dogmatics, Volume II: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Radical Alienation**
   - Humanity is fundamentally estranged from God due to **original sin**.
   - Sin is not merely a weakness but a total disruption of the God-human relationship.
   - Brunner rejects Pelagian optimism regarding human moral ability.
   - He insists that only **God’s grace** can overcome this alienation.
   - "Sin is not a mere imperfection, but a revolt against God." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Grace as Divine Initiative**
   - Salvation begins entirely with God’s initiative, not human effort.
   - Brunner opposes any notion that humans can merit grace.
   - He affirms the **priority of grace** in the order of salvation.
   - Grace is both prevenient and enabling, preceding any human response.
   - "The initiative in salvation lies wholly with God." (The Mediator)

3. **Human Response and Responsibility**
   - While grace is primary, Brunner maintains that humans are addressed as responsible agents.
   - He rejects both Pelagian self-sufficiency and Augustinian determinism.
   - The human will is enabled by grace to respond, but never coerced.
   - This response is a genuine encounter, not an automatic effect.
   - "God’s address calls forth a real answer from man, though it is always enabled by grace." (Nature and Grace)

4. **Critique of Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism**
   - Brunner explicitly denies that humans possess any innate capacity to turn to God unaided.
   - He critiques Semi-Pelagianism for minimizing the depth of sin and the necessity of grace.
   - Any cooperation with grace is itself a result of grace, not autonomous will.
   - He warns against moralism and self-reliance in the doctrine of salvation.
   - "There is no point at which man can boast before God." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

5. **Qualified Reception of Augustinianism**
   - Brunner affirms Augustinian insights on the bondage of the will and the necessity of grace.
   - He rejects absolute predestinarianism and double predestination.
   - Human freedom, though impaired, is not annihilated by sin.
   - He seeks a balance between divine sovereignty and genuine human response.
   - "Grace does not act mechanically; it seeks the free response of the person." (Nature and Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s nuanced engagement with **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism** shaped mid-twentieth-century Protestant thought, especially in the context of the **dialectical theology** movement. His insistence on both the radical need for grace and the reality of human response influenced later discussions on **soteriology** and the relationship between divine sovereignty and human freedom. Brunner’s mediating position continues to be referenced in debates over the nature of grace, freedom, and the human condition.
