# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray was a staunch defender of **Augustinianism**, especially regarding the doctrines of **original sin**, **total depravity**, and **sovereign grace**. He sharply distinguished **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism** as departures from the biblical doctrine of **salvation by grace alone**, emphasizing the utter inability of fallen humanity and the necessity of **divine initiative** in regeneration.

- "The doctrine of sin is not only the indispensable presupposition of the gospel, but it is also the indispensable presupposition of the grace of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Imputation of Adam’s Sin" (1959)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray," Volumes 1–4
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (1959–1965)
- "Calvin on the Sovereignty of God and Reprobation" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Inability**
   - Humanity, after the Fall, is wholly unable to respond to God apart from grace.
   - **Pelagianism** is rejected for denying the pervasive effects of sin on the will.
   - **Semi-Pelagianism** is critiqued for positing human initiative in salvation.
   - Murray insists that all spiritual good originates in God’s sovereign work.
   - "The doctrine of total depravity means that the corruption of sin extends to every aspect of man's nature." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Imputation of Adam’s Sin**
   - Adam’s first transgression is judicially imputed to all his descendants.
   - This imputation grounds the universality of **original sin** and human guilt.
   - Murray defends this against both Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian denials.
   - He sees this as essential for understanding the necessity of Christ’s atonement.
   - "The sin of Adam is the judicial ground of the condemnation of all." (The Imputation of Adam’s Sin)

3. **Sovereign Grace in Salvation**
   - Salvation is initiated and accomplished by God’s sovereign grace alone.
   - Human will plays no cooperative or preparatory role in regeneration.
   - Murray opposes any synergistic view as a compromise of **Augustinianism**.
   - The effectual call is monergistic, not dependent on human response.
   - "Regeneration is exclusively the work of the Holy Spirit." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Necessity of Effectual Calling**
   - The call of God in salvation is not merely an external invitation.
   - Effectual calling actually brings about the response it commands.
   - Murray distinguishes this sharply from the Semi-Pelagian notion of prevenient grace.
   - The efficacy of the call is rooted in God’s eternal purpose.
   - "The call is effectual because it carries with it the efficacy of the Holy Spirit." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Biblical Authority for Augustinianism**
   - Murray grounds his theology in exegesis of key Pauline texts (e.g., Romans 5).
   - He insists that **Augustinianism** is the faithful expression of biblical teaching.
   - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian positions are seen as exegetically and theologically deficient.
   - The Reformed tradition is upheld as the true heir of apostolic doctrine.
   - "The teaching of the apostle Paul is the death-knell of every form of Pelagianism." (The Epistle to the Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s rigorous defense of **Augustinian orthodoxy** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially through his teaching at Westminster Theological Seminary. His clear articulation of the distinctions between **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism** remains a standard reference in Reformed soteriology. Murray’s exegetical precision and theological depth continue to influence discussions on the nature of sin, grace, and salvation within the broader evangelical and Reformed communities.
