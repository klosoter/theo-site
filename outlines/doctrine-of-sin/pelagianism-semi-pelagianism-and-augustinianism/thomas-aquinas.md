# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a comprehensive doctrine of **grace** that decisively rejected both **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**. He insisted on the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation and any truly good act, while maintaining a real—though always grace-enabled—role for **human cooperation**.

- "Without the help of grace, man cannot prepare himself for the light of grace, nor can he rise from sin, nor avoid sin, nor do any good work meritorious of eternal life." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.109, a.6)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 109–114
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on Romans
- De Veritate, q. 24
- Grace and Free Will (De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio) [sections within broader works]

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Grace is absolutely necessary for salvation**
    - Fallen humanity cannot attain **eternal life** or perform truly meritorious acts without **infused grace**.
    - Even the first movement toward God (conversion) requires **prevenient grace**.
    - Grace is both **healing** (removes sin) and **elevating** (enables supernatural acts).
    - All good in humans is ultimately attributed to the **initiative of God**.
    "Man cannot rise from sin without the help of grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.109, a.7)

2. **Human free will is real but wounded**
    - The **will** remains after the Fall but is weakened and inclined toward sin.
    - Free will can cooperate with grace but cannot initiate saving good.
    - Aquinas rejects both **Pelagian** denial of original sin’s effects and **determinism**.
    - Human assent is necessary, but only possible through **grace-enabled freedom**.
    "Free-will is not taken away by grace, but is strengthened and perfected." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.10, a.2)

3. **Original sin corrupts but does not destroy nature**
    - Human nature is **wounded** (not annihilated) by original sin.
    - The image of God remains, though marred and needing restoration.
    - All are born in a state of **original sin**, necessitating grace for any good.
    - Aquinas opposes Pelagian optimism about unaided human nature.
    "Original sin is the privation of original justice." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.82, a.3)

4. **Justification is by grace, involving both infusion and cooperation**
    - **Justification** begins with God’s gracious initiative, not human merit.
    - The process includes the **infusion of grace**, forgiveness of sins, and renewal of the will.
    - Human cooperation is real but always secondary to God’s action.
    - Aquinas avoids Semi-Pelagianism by insisting on the priority of grace at every stage.
    "God alone moves the soul to accept the gift of grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.113, a.3)

5. **Distinction between operative and cooperative grace**
    - **Operative grace** acts in the soul without human cooperation (e.g., initial conversion).
    - **Cooperative grace** enables the will to act alongside God in subsequent good works.
    - Both forms are necessary, but operative grace always precedes.
    - This distinction safeguards both **divine sovereignty** and genuine human response.
    "God works in us without us; but not so that we do nothing." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.111, a.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **Augustinianism** with Aristotelian philosophy shaped the Roman Catholic doctrine of grace and free will, providing a standard against both **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** errors. His careful distinctions influenced later debates at Trent and among Reformed and Catholic theologians alike. The **Thomistic** framework remains a touchstone for discussions of nature, grace, and human agency in Western theology.
