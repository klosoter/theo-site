# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine was the principal architect of **Augustinianism**, formulating a robust doctrine of **original sin**, the necessity of **divine grace**, and the utter inability of fallen humanity to initiate salvation. In opposition to **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**, Augustine insisted that salvation is entirely a work of **God’s sovereign grace**, with human will being radically corrupted by the Fall and thus incapable of turning to God apart from regeneration.

- "Give what you command, and command what you will." (Confessions)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- On Nature and Grace
- On the Spirit and the Letter
- On the Proceedings of Pelagius
- On the Predestination of the Saints
- City of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Original Sin**
    - Humanity inherits both guilt and corruption from Adam.
    - The will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose good without grace.
    - Sin is not merely imitation but a condition transmitted by generation.
    - All are born under condemnation apart from Christ.
    - "For in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." (City of God)

2. **Necessity and Priority of Grace**
    - Divine grace is absolutely necessary for any movement toward God.
    - Grace precedes, enables, and sustains all acts of faith and obedience.
    - Human will is passive until liberated by grace.
    - Grace is not merely external help but an inward transformation.
    - "Without God’s grace, men can do nothing whatever pertaining to godliness." (On Nature and Grace)

3. **Irresistibility of Grace**
    - Saving grace effectively brings about the conversion of the elect.
    - Grace overcomes the resistance of the fallen will.
    - Not all receive this effectual grace; it is given according to God’s purpose.
    - The elect cannot finally resist God’s saving action.
    - "Whoever are delivered are most certainly delivered by the help of God’s grace." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

4. **Predestination and Election**
    - God sovereignly chooses whom He will save, apart from foreseen merit.
    - Election is rooted in God’s mercy, not human initiative.
    - Predestination ensures the infallible salvation of the elect.
    - Reprobation is the just consequence for those left in sin.
    - "He chooses us not because we believe, but that we may believe." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

5. **Rejection of Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism**
    - Pelagianism denies original sin and asserts the natural ability to do good.
    - Semi-Pelagianism allows for initial human movement toward God without grace.
    - Augustine refuted both, insisting on the utter dependence on grace from start to finish.
    - Any doctrine that attributes the first step of faith to human will is contrary to the gospel.
    - "It is not by our merits that we are saved, but by the gift of God’s mercy." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **original sin** and the necessity of **sovereign grace** became foundational for Western Christian theology, shaping both the medieval church and the Protestant Reformers. His anti-Pelagian writings decisively influenced the development of doctrines of **predestination** and **effectual calling**. The Augustinian tradition remains a central reference point in debates over human nature, free will, and divine grace, and his legacy endures in both Roman Catholic and Reformed thought.
