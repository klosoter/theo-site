### ESSAY
The controversy between Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and Augustinianism is fundamentally a dispute over what has become of human nature in Adam and what that implies for the necessity, priority, and efficacy of **divine grace**. At stake is not only a theory of conversion but the coherence of the doctrines of **original sin**, **election**, **Christ’s atonement**, and even **providence**. Because Westminster examiners will press this point, one must be able to give a crisp definition: Pelagianism holds that Adam’s sin injures his posterity only by bad example, leaving the human will constitutionally able, without inward renewing grace, to obey God’s commands and merit eternal life. Semi-Pelagianism confesses that sin has weakened the will such that grace is necessary for completion of the good, but still attributes to the fallen will the first initiative in turning to God or at least a non-graced ability to cooperate with grace. Augustinianism, in its classical form, asserts that Adam’s sin has plunged his race into a state of **total depravity** and **bondage of the will**, so that the first turning to God is itself a sovereign work of efficacious, **prevenient** and regenerating grace given according to unconditional election.

Pelagius emerges at the turn of the fifth century as a rigorist moralist reacting to what he perceived as moral laxity in the Latin church. His background as a British monk and ascetic is crucial for understanding his theology. Confronted with nominal Christianity and what he saw as Augustine’s pessimism, Pelagius feared that strong doctrines of sin and dependence on grace would excuse sloth. In his Commentary on Romans and letters such as the now-lost work On Nature, Pelagius insists that God’s commands presuppose human ability. His maxim, repeatedly reported by his opponents, is: “If I ought, I can.” He explicitly rejects the idea that Adam’s sin corrupts human nature in such a way that we are born guilty or inwardly inclined to sin. Adam is a bad example, Christ a good example. Infants are born in the same moral condition as Adam before the fall, and every sin is a fresh, unnecessitated choice. Grace, for Pelagius, is primarily external: the law, the teaching and example of Christ, the forgiveness of past sins. But the decisive movement from unbelief to faith is fundamentally the work of a free will which, though needing divine help in a general sense, retains a native capacity to choose the good unaided.

An examiner may push: is this simply a crude moralism, or did Pelagius have a real doctrine of grace? The answer must be nuanced but firm. Pelagius uses the language of grace, yet systematically evacuates it of the Augustinian content of interior renewal. At most he allows a cooperative grace that makes obedience easier, but not a grace that is strictly necessary for any obedient act. At the conceptual core of his system is a synergistic anthropology grounded in a strong, almost Stoic, conception of **libertarian freedom**: the will must remain indifferent between good and evil, otherwise moral responsibility collapses. From this standpoint, a robust doctrine of **original sin** and of efficacious predestinating grace would be inconsistent with divine justice and with the exhortatory structure of Scripture. Pelagius thus reframes the gospel as the restoration of law-obedience within the created natural capacities of human nature.

Augustine responds to Pelagius by radicalizing and systematizing themes already present in his earlier anti-Manichaean and anti-Donatist writings. His decisive works in the Pelagian controversy are On the Spirit and the Letter, On Nature and Grace, On the Grace of Christ and Original Sin, On the Predestination of the Saints, and On the Gift of Perseverance. Methodologically, Augustine reads Scripture as a unified narrative of God’s absolute initiative in salvation, accompanied by a deep introspective analysis of the will. He had already, in his Confessions, narrated his own conversion as a sheer gift of God’s mercy invading a will that was “curved in on itself.” In the Pelagian context, he sharpens this into doctrinal formulations.

For Augustine, Adam was created upright, with a posse peccare and posse non peccare, but the fall introduces a massa perditionis in which the whole race is implicated. This solidarity is not mere imitation but a real participation in Adam’s guilt and corruption. Hence his insistence on infant baptism as the washing away of original guilt. He articulates a strong version of **original sin**: we are born not merely inclined to sin but unable not to sin, with a non posse non peccare. That raises the obvious examiner question: does this not make God the author of sin, or at least render commandments meaningless? Augustine’s rejoinder rests on **divine simplicity** and **aseity**. God’s justice and goodness are identical with his being; he is not measured by a standard of fairness external to himself. In terms of human responsibility, Augustine appeals to the distinction between natural and moral ability. We retain faculties of intellect and will, and act voluntarily according to our desires, but those desires are disordered. The inability is moral and spiritual, not a destruction of rational agency. Therefore, culpability stands even when the will is in **bondage**.

From this anthropology flows his doctrine of grace. Augustine insists on the priority, necessity, and efficacy of **prevenient grace**. The first motion of the will toward God, including the very act of faith, is a gift, not a product of the old nature’s cooperation. Grace does not merely assist a self-initiated movement; it creates the movement. He then connects this to **unconditional election**. In On the Predestination of the Saints Augustine argues that God’s choice of some and not others is not based on foreseen faith or works, but that the faith and perseverance of the elect are themselves effects of electing grace. His mature position, therefore, is: all humanity is justly condemned in Adam; God mercifully chooses some; Christ’s atonement is sufficient for all but efficacious for the elect; the Spirit grants a **regenerating grace** that infallibly brings the elect to faith and perseveres with them to glory.

A Westminster examiner will immediately press tensions between this Augustinianism and other loci. Does this compromise **human freedom** or render the sacraments and preaching superfluous? Augustine answers by appeal to **compatibilist freedom**: freedom is acting according to one’s strongest inclination; God’s grace changes the heart so that its inclinations conform to his will. Far from bypassing means, God ordains preaching, sacraments, and exhortations as the very instruments through which his efficacious grace operates. This is why Augustine can exhort unbelievers sincerely while confessing that only some will be brought by God to heed the exhortation.

Between Pelagius and the full Augustinian position arises a cluster of mediating views often labeled Semi-Pelagianism, whose classic representative is John Cassian. Cassian was a monk who transmitted Eastern ascetical traditions into the West, especially through his Conferences. In Conference 13 and others he shows admiration for Augustine, affirms the reality of original sin and the need for grace, yet balks at what he perceives as fatalism in strong predestinarianism. He grants that human nature is weakened by the fall and cannot attain salvation without grace, but he insists that the first step toward salvation, the initial desire for faith, can arise from free will unaided. Grace then comes to meet this first movement and cooperates with it. Sometimes he speaks of the will and grace “taking turns,” sometimes of the will “assenting” to grace. The key conceptual marker of Semi-Pelagianism, therefore, is the attribution of the initium fidei, the beginning of faith, to the fallen will rather than to grace, or at least to a synergy in which the human contribution is not itself caused by grace.

An examiner may ask whether this is really a distinct position or simply a softer Augustinianism. Theologically it is distinct, because Augustine’s mature soteriology denies that there is any good motion toward God not caused by grace. Moreover, Semi-Pelagianism tends inevitably to reintroduce a foreseen-faith condition into predestination: God elects those whom he foresees will take the initial step or minimally will not resist grace. The Council of Orange (529) is often appealed to in this connection. While not one of our decisive figures, it is important as a synthesis: Orange, drawing on Augustine, anathematizes Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian denials of the priority of grace, asserting that even the beginning of faith is a gift. Yet it does not affirm the full Augustinian doctrine of double predestination, leaving an unresolved tension that later traditions will exploit.

Thomas Aquinas systematizes this Augustinian inheritance within the high medieval scholastic framework. Aquinas is not a Pelagian or Semi-Pelagian, but he is a decisive figure because he refines a doctrine of **grace and nature** that later Roman Catholicism will deploy over against Reformation Augustinianism. In the Summa Theologiae, especially in the questions on grace and justification, Thomas articulates three key theses. First, he fully endorses a strong version of original sin: Adam’s sin brings guilt and habitual disorder into human nature, transmitted to all. The human will is unable to attain supernatural beatitude by its natural powers. Second, he asserts the absolute necessity of prevenient grace for any salutary act, including the beginning of faith. He explicitly rejects the idea that fallen man can prepare himself for grace without grace. In this respect he sides decisively with Augustine and the Council of Orange. Third, Aquinas develops a robust doctrine of **infused habits** and cooperation. Justification, for Thomas, involves the infusion of **sanctifying grace** and charity, which heal and elevate the faculties. The renewed will truly cooperates with grace, meriting an increase of grace and eternal life under the motion of God.

The internal debate here concerns the exact sense in which grace is efficacious and whether God’s predestination is conditionally or unconditionally ordered. Aquinas affirms unconditional predestination to glory and the infallible efficacy of grace, but attempts to reconcile this with a real though subordinate causal contribution of the human will moved by God as first cause. His doctrine of contingent secondary causes and **analogy** of causality is intended to preserve genuine contingency and responsibility within a framework of meticulous providence. Later Thomists will sharpen this into doctrines of physical premotion and intrinsic efficacy of grace, while Molinists will react by positing a **middle knowledge** in which God knows what free creatures would do in any circumstance and ordains salvation conditioned on such foreseen acts. For our purposes, the main point is that medieval Augustinianism remains committed to the primacy of grace but begins to articulate more symmetrical accounts of cooperation and human merit.

In the sixteenth century, the Council of Trent crystallizes the Roman Catholic position in its Decree on Justification. Trent explicitly condemns Pelagianism, affirming original sin, the necessity of grace, and the priority of God’s initiative. It also, under Augustinian influence, declares that the beginning of faith is itself the effect of grace. At the same time, it rejects the Reformation’s forensic-only account of justification and its doctrine of **monergistic regeneration**. Justification, according to Trent, consists in both the remission of sins and the sanctification and renewal of the inner man. It is inaugurated by grace through faith, hope, and charity infused in baptism, but the justified can increase in justifying righteousness through good works that are themselves gifts of God yet also true merits. Crucially, Trent teaches that grace is resistible and that the justified can fall away by mortal sin.

This Tridentine synthesis positions itself as anti-Pelagian but functionally anti-Augustinian in its Reformation form. While maintaining the priority of grace, it structures salvation such that grace and free will are co-principles in justification and perseverance. Contemporary Roman Catholic theology often uses the language of **prevenient grace**, but this grace is universal, resistible, and ordered toward enabling a libertarianly free response. Many Protestant theologians, especially in the Wesleyan tradition, adopt this notion of a universal, non-necessitating prevenient grace that restores a measure of free will to all, allowing them to believe or not. From the standpoint of classic Reformed Augustinianism, this is structurally Semi-Pelagian even if verbally anti-Pelagian, because it posits a grace that is universally given and yet only becomes efficacious through the libertarianly free cooperation of the human will, thereby making the final differentiator between saved and lost something in the human decision not itself decisively caused by grace.

Against both Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian constructions, a Westminster candidate should own a robust Augustinian and Reformed position. This position can be summarized in several **doctrinal anchors**. First, **total depravity**: in Adam all humanity is guilty, corrupt, and spiritually dead. This does not mean that human nature as such is destroyed or that every act is as evil as it could be, but that every faculty is pervasively disordered and that there is no spiritual good in us that inclines us to God. Second, **bondage of the will**: the unregenerate will is not free in a libertarian sense with respect to God, but is enslaved to sin, always choosing in accordance with its corrupt desires. Third, **prevenient and efficacious grace**: the first motion of the will toward Christ is entirely due to the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit in regeneration. This grace is not merely assisting but effectual, infallibly bringing the elect to faith while leaving others in their just condemnation. Fourth, **unconditional election** and particular redemption: God’s choice is not conditioned on foreseen faith or cooperation; rather, faith and cooperation are the fruits of election and of Christ’s atoning work applied.

Examiners will often pose the hard objection: does this make God partial or unjust, choosing some and not others when all are equally undeserving? The Augustinian response must be twofold. On the one hand, the doctrine of **original sin** and just condemnation means that God owes mercy to none. To treat some according to strict justice and others according to mercy is not injustice but the display of both attributes to the praise of his glory. On the other hand, **divine simplicity** rules out thinking of God as torn between competing attributes. His election is the outworking of his single, wise, and good will. Moreover, the alternative systems do not escape analogous difficulties. Semi-Pelagian and Arminian theologies must explain why God, foreseeing that some would freely cooperate and others would not, created those who he knew would damn themselves. If they reply that God permits this for the sake of respecting libertarian freedom, then freedom becomes the ultimate value to which salvation is subordinated. Augustinianism, by contrast, maintains that God’s ultimate end is the manifestation of his own glory in both justice and mercy.

Another standard objection is pastoral: if only the elect will be infallibly saved by efficacious grace, can the unconverted sincerely be invited to believe? The Reformed Augustinian must answer that the universal call of the gospel rests not on an abstract ability in all to respond, but on the revealed sufficiency of Christ and the divinely commanded duty of all to repent and believe. The secret decree of election is not the rule of preaching. God truly offers Christ to all who hear the gospel and sincerely promises salvation to all who come. Those who come will, in retrospect, know that grace had drawn them; those who refuse cannot blame their inability, since their refusal is the expression of their own corrupt love of sin. Here **compatibilist freedom** and **federal theology** intersect: Adam’s representative sin is the ground of our condemnation, and our own willing rejection of God confirms that verdict.

Internally, within the Augustinian and Reformed tradition, there are further debates that an examiner may exploit. How exactly does grace “irresistibly” work on the will without violating its created integrity? Different schools answer by appeal to distinct accounts of causality. Some stress the Spirit’s immediate infusion of a new habitus that spontaneously inclines the will; others, especially in post-Reformation scholasticism, develop a more technical doctrine of concurrence and moral suasion. But all agree that the decisive factor in conversion is grace, not some neutral cooperation from a partially intact nature. There are also intramural disputes about the order of decrees in God’s eternal counsel, whether **supralapsarian** or **infralapsarian**, but these do not alter the essential anti-Pelagian, anti-Semi-Pelagian stance. Even in the broader Protestant world, where Lutheran and Reformed diverge on the extent of the atonement and the resistibility of grace in the regenerate, both stand together on the core Augustinian conviction that the unregenerate cannot initiate faith and that conversion is monergistic.

The contemporary relevance of these ancient debates surfaces in several ways. Modern therapeutic and existential theologies often adopt an implicitly Pelagian or Semi-Pelagian anthropology. Sin is reduced to maladjustment, structures of oppression, or inauthenticity; the gospel becomes reassurance or empowerment. In such a horizon, talk of **total depravity** and **bondage of the will** seems toxic. Similarly, contemporary analytic philosophy of religion typically operates with a strong commitment to libertarian freedom, making Augustinian determinism appear morally problematic. Some evangelical theologians attempt a mediating stance, affirming original sin yet positing a universal, resistible **prevenient grace** that restores libertarianly valid “free will” to all. From a classical Augustinian perspective, these moves reproduce the conceptual structure of Semi-Pelagianism, even if cloaked in more sophisticated language.

Defending a robust Augustinianism today therefore requires both historical and philosophical clarity. Historically, one must show that Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views were repeatedly judged incompatible with the scriptural witness by the catholic church: Pelagius was condemned at the Councils of Carthage and Ephesus; Semi-Pelagian propositions were rejected at Orange. Medieval and Tridentine theology, while not purely Augustinian, never dared to affirm that fallen man could initiate faith without grace. Philosophically, one must challenge the assumption that libertarian freedom is necessary for responsibility. Augustine’s own introspective psychology and the Reformed tradition’s development of **compatibilist freedom** supply an alternative: responsibility depends on voluntary action in accordance with one’s desires and rational awareness, not on the power of contrary choice. Biblically, texts such as Romans 5, Ephesians 2, John 6, and Acts 13–16 present a picture of humanity as dead in sin, of faith as a gift, and of God as opening hearts and granting repentance.

In sum, the contrast between Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and Augustinianism is not a marginal technicality but a structural fault line in Christian theology. Pelagius, in his zeal for moral responsibility, denied **original sin** and collapsed grace into external aids, effectively turning the gospel into a new law and attributing salvation to native human capacity. John Cassian and his fellow Semi-Pelagians, anxious to protect free initiative, ascribed the beginning of faith to the fallen will, thereby making grace subsequent or at least coordinate to human decision. Augustine, followed in crucial respects by Aquinas, the better Catholic tradition, and the Reformation, recognized that such constructions are inconsistent with both Scripture and experience. Thus he insisted that fallen man is a slave to sin, that the first and every saving motion of the will is caused by **prevenient and efficacious grace**, and that this grace flows from God’s sovereign and unconditional election. Trent and much modern Arminianism, while rejecting crude Pelagianism, ultimately side with Semi-Pelagian structure by positing a grace that awaits and depends upon libertarian cooperation.

The position to be defended, especially in a Westminster context, is therefore clear: only a thoroughgoing Augustinianism preserves the glory of **divine grace**, the coherence of **substitutionary atonement**, the reality of **union with Christ**, and the comfort of the gospel for those who know themselves to be helpless sinners. Any system that locates the decisive difference between saved and lost finally in the fallen will, rather than in the gracious will of God, reintroduces boasting, destabilizes assurance, and contradicts the biblical witness to a salvation that is “not of him who wills or runs, but of God who has mercy.”

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Pelagianism denies **original sin** and asserts native human ability to obey without internal renewing grace; Semi-Pelagianism affirms sin and the need for grace but ascribes the first move or decisive cooperation to free will; Augustinianism teaches **total depravity**, **bondage of the will**, and the priority and efficacy of **prevenient grace** grounded in **unconditional election**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Pelagius: moralist emphasizing “if I ought, I can,” grace as external aid, denial of inherited guilt and inward corruption.
  - Augustine: Latin father articulating strong original sin, monergistic grace, compatibilist freedom, unconditional election.
  - John Cassian: ascetic theologian affirming grace yet making the initium fidei a free act of the fallen will, paradigmatic Semi-Pelagian.
  - Thomas Aquinas: medieval Augustinian synthesizer of nature and grace, affirming necessity of prevenient grace yet elaborating real cooperation.
  - Council of Trent: anti-Pelagian yet functionally Semi-Pelagian synthesis, universal resistible grace, cooperative justification.
- Debates:
  - Internal: within Augustinianism, how to articulate **efficacious grace**, cooperation, and predestination while preserving real agency.
  - External: Pelagian denial of original sin and need for grace; Semi-Pelagian assertion of free initiative; Molinist and Arminian conditional election.
  - Contemporary: libertarian freedom vs **compatibilist** models, universal **prevenient grace**, therapeutic anthropologies that dilute sin.
- Defended position: a Reformed Augustinianism in which fallen humanity is radically unable to turn to God, and saving faith and perseverance are wholly the effects of sovereign, efficacious, and particular **grace**, not conditioned on foreseen human cooperation.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Does Augustine’s view make humans puppets? No, because it affirms **compatibilist freedom**, where the renewed will freely chooses according to new God-given desires.
  - Is Semi-Pelagianism really heretical if it talks much about grace? Yes, because it locates the decisive first step or cooperation in the fallen will, thereby denying the monergistic character of the initium fidei.
  - How does this relate to justification by faith alone? If faith itself is a gift of efficacious grace, then justification by faith alone is simultaneously justification by grace alone, excluding all boasting.
  - Can we sincerely offer the gospel to all if only the elect can respond? Yes, because the external call is grounded in God’s revealed will and Christ’s sufficiency, while efficacious grace is God’s secret work through that call.
  - Is Roman Catholicism Pelagian? Officially no, since it affirms original sin and prevenient grace, but its Tridentine and many contemporary formulations are structurally Semi-Pelagian by making grace resistible and salvation dependent on libertarian cooperation.
