# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the debates over **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism** through his existential and ontological framework, emphasizing the depth of **human estrangement** and the necessity of **grace**. He critiqued both Pelagian optimism about human nature and Augustinian determinism, seeking a mediating position that underscores the existential condition of **sin** and the transformative power of **divine grace**.

- "Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness... it strikes us when, year after year, the longed-for perfection of life does not appear." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Existential Estrangement**
    - Sin is not merely a moral failure but a state of **alienation from the Ground of Being**.
    - Rejects Pelagianism’s view of sin as simply bad choices; sees it as a universal existential condition.
    - Human beings are fundamentally estranged from their true essence and from God.
    - This estrangement necessitates a radical solution beyond human capacity.
    - "Sin is separation. To be in the state of sin is to be in the state of separation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Grace as the Power of New Being**
    - Grace is the **unconditional acceptance** and transformative power that overcomes estrangement.
    - Opposes both Pelagian self-sufficiency and Augustinian predestinarianism.
    - Grace is not a supernatural addition but the **reunion with the Ground of Being**.
    - It is experienced existentially as the power that creates new being out of the old.
    - "Grace is the acceptance of that which is rejected." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

3. **Critique of Pelagianism**
    - Pelagianism underestimates the depth of **human estrangement** and the necessity of grace.
    - Tillich sees Pelagianism as a form of **moralism** that cannot address existential alienation.
    - Human will is insufficient for salvation; transformation requires divine initiative.
    - Pelagian optimism about human nature is incompatible with Tillich’s ontology of sin.
    - "The self-affirmation of man is not enough; it must be accepted by the power of being-itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Critique of Augustinianism**
    - Augustinianism’s emphasis on **predestination** and total depravity risks undermining human freedom.
    - Tillich affirms the seriousness of sin but resists deterministic anthropology.
    - He seeks to preserve the existential dimension of human responsibility.
    - Divine grace does not override but enables authentic human response.
    - "The power of grace does not destroy the freedom of man; it makes it possible." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Existential Mediation between Extremes**
    - Tillich offers a **mediating position** between Pelagian and Augustinian extremes.
    - Emphasizes the dialectic of **freedom and destiny** in the human condition.
    - Salvation is neither human achievement nor passive reception, but existential participation in new being.
    - The church’s proclamation of grace addresses the existential anxiety of estrangement.
    - "Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned: the dynamics of faith are the dynamics of man’s ultimate concern." (Dynamics of Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **sin** and **grace** provided a powerful alternative to classical debates over Pelagianism and Augustinianism, influencing 20th-century theology’s engagement with modern existentialism. His focus on **estrangement** and the **Ground of Being** shaped discussions on the human condition and the meaning of salvation. While not fitting neatly into traditional categories, Tillich’s thought continues to challenge and enrich contemporary understandings of **human nature** and **divine grace**.
