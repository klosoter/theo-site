# Sinclair Ferguson (1948–)

Sinclair Ferguson is a leading contemporary Reformed theologian who robustly defends **Augustinianism** against both **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**. He insists on the absolute necessity of **divine grace** for salvation, emphasizing the doctrines of **total depravity** and **monergistic regeneration** as foundational to the gospel. Ferguson critiques any theological system that diminishes the sufficiency or necessity of **sovereign grace** in the application of redemption.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - Humanity is radically corrupted by the Fall, affecting every aspect of the person.
    - No one can initiate a move toward God apart from **prevenient grace**.
    - Pelagianism is rejected for denying original sin and human inability.
    - Semi-Pelagianism is critiqued for positing a cooperative role in the first step of salvation.
    "The heart of the matter is that we are not sick, but dead, in trespasses and sins." (The Christian Life)

2. **Sovereign Grace in Salvation**
    - Salvation is entirely the work of God from beginning to end.
    - Grace is not merely assistance but the decisive cause of regeneration and faith.
    - Any admixture of human merit or initiative undermines the gospel.
    - Augustinianism rightly locates the initiative and efficacy of grace in God alone.
    "Grace does not merely make salvation possible, it makes it actual." (By Grace Alone)

3. **Monergistic Regeneration**
    - The new birth is a unilateral act of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Human will is passive in regeneration; faith is the result, not the cause.
    - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views are rejected for making regeneration synergistic.
    - The **Reformed tradition** upholds monergism as essential to the gospel.
    "Regeneration is the root, faith is the fruit." (The Christian Life)

4. **The Necessity of Christ’s Work**
    - Christ’s atonement is necessary because of the depth of human sin.
    - Pelagianism’s optimism about human ability undermines the necessity of a Redeemer.
    - Only a substitutionary, effectual atonement can save those who are spiritually dead.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s finished work, not human cooperation.
    "If we could save ourselves, Christ died for nothing." (The Whole Christ)

5. **Pastoral Implications of Grace**
    - Assurance and comfort flow from a robust doctrine of **sovereign grace**.
    - Legalism and antinomianism are both rooted in misunderstandings of grace.
    - The church must guard against subtle forms of Semi-Pelagianism in preaching and counseling.
    - The Marrow Controversy illustrates the ongoing relevance of Augustinianism for pastoral ministry.
    "The antidote to both legalism and antinomianism is the same: the grace of God in Christ." (The Whole Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Sinclair Ferguson has played a pivotal role in articulating and defending **Augustinian soteriology** for contemporary audiences, especially within the Reformed and evangelical world. His clear exposition of the dangers of **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism** has shaped pastoral practice and theological education, particularly through his engagement with the Marrow tradition. Ferguson’s work continues to influence how churches understand the relationship between grace, faith, and assurance, reinforcing the centrality of sovereign grace in the Christian life.
