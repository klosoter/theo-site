# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin was a staunch defender of **Augustinianism** in the face of **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** challenges, emphasizing the total depravity of humanity and the necessity of **sovereign grace** for salvation. He systematically rejected any notion that human will could cooperate with or initiate saving faith apart from **divine regeneration**, aligning closely with the **Reformed doctrine of original sin** and **predestination**.

- "The Pelagians, by denying original sin and maintaining the sufficiency of free will, overthrow the necessity of grace and the whole foundation of the gospel." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- The Atonement of Christ (De Satisfactione Christi)
- Compendium and Catechism for the Churches of Geneva
- Reformed Dogmatics (as compiled from his lectures and writings)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Original Sin**
    - Humanity is wholly corrupted by **original sin** due to Adam’s fall.
    - No part of human nature remains untainted, including the will and affections.
    - All people are born spiritually dead and unable to choose God apart from grace.
    - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views are rejected as undermining the necessity of Christ.
    - "Original sin is not only the loss of original righteousness, but also the presence of positive evil." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

2. **Necessity and Efficacy of Divine Grace**
    - Salvation is initiated and completed by **sovereign grace** alone.
    - Grace is not merely an aid but the effective cause of regeneration and faith.
    - Human will is passive in regeneration; it cannot cooperate prior to renewal.
    - Semi-Pelagianism is refuted for positing a synergistic view of conversion.
    - "Grace does not merely assist the will, but creates in us both the willing and the doing." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

3. **Predestination and Election**
    - God’s **election** is unconditional, based solely on His will and not foreseen faith.
    - Predestination is the foundation of the application of grace to the elect.
    - Reprobation is just, as all are guilty in Adam and none deserve mercy.
    - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian systems are critiqued for making election contingent on human response.
    - "Election is not founded upon faith, but faith is the fruit and effect of election." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

4. **Imputation of Adam’s Sin**
    - Adam acted as the federal head of humanity; his guilt and corruption are imputed to all.
    - This imputation is both judicial and real, affecting the entire human race.
    - Denial of imputation (as in Pelagianism) destroys the necessity of Christ’s atonement.
    - The remedy for imputed sin is found only in the imputed righteousness of Christ.
    - "The imputation of Adam’s sin is the ground of our condemnation, as the imputation of Christ’s righteousness is the ground of our justification." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

5. **Rejection of Human Merit**
    - No human work or decision can merit or initiate salvation.
    - All boasting is excluded; salvation is by **grace alone** through faith alone.
    - Even faith itself is a gift, not a human achievement.
    - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian errors are exposed as reintroducing human merit into salvation.
    - "If grace is not wholly gratuitous, it ceases to be grace." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous defense of **Augustinian orthodoxy** shaped Reformed theology’s response to **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism** for generations, especially in the context of post-Reformation debates. His Institutes became a standard text in Reformed seminaries, reinforcing the doctrines of **total depravity**, **sovereign grace**, and **unconditional election**. Turretin’s careful distinctions and polemical clarity continue to influence systematic theology, particularly in discussions of human nature, grace, and salvation. His legacy endures as a bulwark against synergistic and anthropocentric tendencies in soteriology.
