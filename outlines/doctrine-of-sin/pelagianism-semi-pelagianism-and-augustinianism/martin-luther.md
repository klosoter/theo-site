# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther forcefully rejected **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**, insisting on the utter inability of fallen humanity to contribute to its own **salvation**. He championed an **Augustinian** understanding of **original sin**, **bondage of the will**, and **sovereign grace**, arguing that only God's unilateral action in **justification** can rescue sinners. For Luther, any cooperation with grace undermines the sufficiency of Christ and the radical nature of human depravity.

- "Man’s will is like a beast standing between two riders. If God rides, it wills and goes where God wills; if Satan rides, it wills and goes where Satan wills." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Key Works

- The Bondage of the Will (De Servo Arbitrio)
- Lectures on Romans
- Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- Commentary on Galatians
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- Luther and the Reformation (secondary, by B.A. Gerrish)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and the Bondage of the Will**
    - Humanity after the Fall is entirely incapable of choosing good apart from divine intervention.
    - The will is not merely weakened but is in bondage to sin and Satan.
    - Any notion of a neutral or autonomous will is rejected as Pelagian error.
    - True freedom is only found in being bound to Christ.
    - "Free will, after the fall, exists in name only, and as long as it does what it is able to do, it commits a mortal sin." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Sovereign Grace in Salvation**
    - Salvation is initiated and completed by God's grace alone, without human cooperation.
    - Faith itself is a gift, not a human work or decision.
    - Grace is not a substance infused but God's favor and action toward the sinner.
    - Any synergism is a form of Semi-Pelagianism and undermines the gospel.
    - "It is not in our power to think a good thought or to do a good deed." (Heidelberg Disputation)

3. **Augustinian Doctrine of Original Sin**
    - Original sin is a radical corruption affecting every aspect of human nature.
    - All humans are born under the power of sin and subject to God's wrath.
    - Sin is not merely imitation but an inherited condition.
    - The necessity of grace is rooted in the depth of original sin.
    - "Original sin is not a slight, but so deep a corruption of nature that no reason can understand it." (Lectures on Romans)

4. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is a forensic act of God, declaring the sinner righteous by faith alone.
    - Human works contribute nothing to justification.
    - Faith is passive, receiving Christ and his righteousness.
    - Any mingling of works with faith is a return to Pelagian or Semi-Pelagian error.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, apart from the works of the law." (Commentary on Galatians)

5. **Rejection of Human Merit**
    - All human merit is excluded from the process of salvation.
    - Even the best human efforts are tainted by sin and cannot please God.
    - The doctrine of merit is a hallmark of Pelagianism and must be rejected.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s merit, not human achievement.
    - "All works and efforts of man are nothing before God, and only Christ’s merit avails." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s uncompromising stance against **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism** shaped the core of Protestant soteriology, especially in the doctrines of **grace** and **justification by faith alone**. His Augustinian emphasis on the bondage of the will and the necessity of sovereign grace became foundational for later Reformed and Lutheran theology. Luther’s polemics against synergism continue to inform debates on human freedom, divine sovereignty, and the nature of salvation within the broader Christian tradition.
