# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge was a staunch defender of **Augustinianism** within the Reformed tradition, sharply distinguishing it from both **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**. He upheld the doctrines of **original sin**, **total depravity**, and **sovereign grace**, insisting that salvation is entirely the work of God and not a cooperation between human will and divine assistance.

- "Pelagianism is the doctrine that the will of man is sufficient to choose what is good, and that divine grace is not necessary." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on original sin and grace

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity of Humanity**
   - Humanity is entirely corrupted by **original sin** due to Adam’s fall.
   - There is no spiritual good in the unregenerate; the will is enslaved to sin.
   - All faculties—mind, will, and affections—are affected by depravity.
   - This depravity is not merely a lack of righteousness but a positive inclination to evil.
   - "The doctrine of original sin is, therefore, the doctrine of the entire depravity of our nature." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Necessity of Sovereign Grace**
   - Salvation is initiated and completed by **God’s sovereign grace** alone.
   - Human will is passive in regeneration; grace is not merely assistance but transformation.
   - Grace is **efficacious**, ensuring the elect will certainly come to faith.
   - Any cooperation of human will with grace is rejected as **Semi-Pelagian**.
   - "Grace is not simply the removal of obstacles, but the actual communication of a new principle of life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Pelagianism**
   - Pelagianism denies the necessity of grace and the reality of inherited guilt.
   - Hodge argues that Pelagianism undermines the gospel by making salvation a human achievement.
   - He insists that Scripture teaches the universality and depth of sin.
   - Pelagianism is incompatible with the doctrines of **atonement** and **justification by faith**.
   - "Pelagianism, in all its forms, is inconsistent with the plain teachings of the Bible." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Critique of Semi-Pelagianism**
   - Semi-Pelagianism admits the need for grace but makes the first movement toward God a human act.
   - Hodge sees this as a subtle form of works-righteousness.
   - He contends that even the first inclination to believe is produced by the Holy Spirit.
   - Semi-Pelagianism is a compromise that ultimately fails to uphold **sola gratia**.
   - "Semi-Pelagianism is only Pelagianism in disguise, for it makes man, and not God, the decisive agent in salvation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Federal Headship of Adam**
   - Adam acted as the representative (federal head) of all humanity.
   - The guilt and corruption of Adam’s sin are imputed to his descendants.
   - This federal relationship grounds the universality of sin and the necessity of redemption.
   - Hodge uses this doctrine to defend **Augustinian** anthropology against Pelagian alternatives.
   - "The imputation of Adam’s sin is the only rational and scriptural explanation of the universal sinfulness of men." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of **Augustinianism** shaped the contours of nineteenth-century American Reformed theology, especially at Princeton Seminary. His clear articulation of the differences between **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinian orthodoxy** became foundational for later Reformed confessionalism. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary debates over human nature, grace, and the doctrine of salvation. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold the primacy of divine grace in the ordo salutis.
