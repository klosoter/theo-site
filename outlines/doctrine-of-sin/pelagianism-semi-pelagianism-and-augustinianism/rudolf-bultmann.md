# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the debates on **Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and Augustinianism** through his existential interpretation of the New Testament, emphasizing the human encounter with the **kerygma** rather than traditional doctrines of **original sin** and **grace**. He rejected both the **optimism of Pelagianism** and the **determinism of Augustinianism**, focusing instead on the individual's response of faith in the context of **demythologization** and existential decision.

- "The real question is not about the possibility of human freedom, but about the possibility of faith as an existential decision in response to the word of God." (Existence and Faith)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann (1960)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Sin and Grace**
    - Interprets **original sin** and **grace** as existential realities, not metaphysical conditions.
    - Sees biblical language as mythological, requiring reinterpretation for modern understanding.
    - Rejects literal readings of **Augustinian anthropology**.
    - Emphasizes the individual's confrontation with the call of God in the present.
    - "Mythological statements about sin and grace must be translated into existential self-understanding." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Decision over Inherited Guilt**
    - Denies the transmission of **original guilt** as taught by Augustinianism.
    - Focuses on the individual's responsibility to respond to God's word.
    - Human existence is characterized by alienation, but not by inherited corruption.
    - Faith is an act of existential decision, not the result of infused grace.
    - "Faith is not a supernatural endowment but a personal decision in the face of God's address." (Existence and Faith)

3. **Critique of Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian Optimism**
    - Rejects the notion that humans can achieve righteousness by their own efforts.
    - Affirms the necessity of divine initiative in the encounter with the **kerygma**.
    - Human will is bound by existential estrangement, not metaphysical depravity.
    - The possibility of faith arises only in response to the proclaimed word.
    - "Man cannot liberate himself from his situation; he can only be addressed and called by God." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Reinterpretation of Grace**
    - Grace is not a substance or infused power but the event of God's address.
    - The experience of grace is existential, not ontological.
    - Rejects both Pelagian self-sufficiency and Augustinian predestinarianism.
    - Grace is encountered in the moment of existential openness to the word.
    - "Grace is the event in which man is encountered by God and called to decision." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Faith as Response, Not Achievement**
    - Faith is not a human work or achievement.
    - It is the authentic response to the **kerygma** in the context of existential crisis.
    - Faith is not meritorious but is the acceptance of God's call.
    - The act of faith transcends the categories of Pelagian merit and Augustinian passivity.
    - "Faith is the surrender of man to the word that addresses him here and now." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **sin**, **grace**, and **faith** reshaped 20th-century discussions of human nature and salvation, especially within the context of **demythologization**. His rejection of both Pelagian and Augustinian frameworks influenced generations of New Testament scholars and theologians, shifting the focus from metaphysical doctrines to existential encounter. While his views remain controversial in confessional circles, Bultmann’s emphasis on the individual's response to the **kerygma** continues to provoke theological reflection on the meaning of faith and grace in the modern world.
