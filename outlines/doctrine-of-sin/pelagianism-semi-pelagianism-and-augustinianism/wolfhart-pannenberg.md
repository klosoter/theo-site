# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg critically engaged the debates between **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism**, emphasizing the necessity of **divine grace** while maintaining a robust view of human **freedom** and **historicity**. He rejected both Pelagian self-sufficiency and deterministic Augustinianism, seeking a mediating position that underscores the eschatological realization of **human nature** in relation to God’s self-revelation.

- "The grace of God does not destroy human freedom, but rather establishes it in its true form." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially sections on anthropology and sin)
- Anthropology in Theological Perspective
- Jesus—God and Man
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2
- "Original Sin and Human Freedom" (essay in various collections)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Pelagian Self-Sufficiency**
    - Asserts that **human beings** cannot achieve righteousness apart from **God’s grace**.
    - Critiques Pelagianism for underestimating the depth of **sin** and the need for redemption.
    - Emphasizes the universality of sin’s effects on human nature.
    - Argues that salvation is always initiated by God, not by autonomous human will.
    - "Pelagianism fails to recognize the radical character of sin as alienation from God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Critique of Augustinian Determinism**
    - Questions the Augustinian view that **grace** is irresistible and human will is entirely passive.
    - Maintains that human response, though enabled by grace, is genuinely free.
    - Sees Augustinianism as risking the negation of authentic human responsibility.
    - Stresses the importance of **historical existence** and personal decision in salvation.
    - "The freedom of the human person is not abolished by grace, but is called into its proper relationship with God." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

3. **Affirmation of Semi-Pelagian Concerns for Human Freedom**
    - Recognizes the Semi-Pelagian emphasis on the necessity of human cooperation with grace.
    - Argues that grace and freedom are not mutually exclusive but are dialectically related.
    - Insists that the human will is not the originator of salvation, but must respond.
    - Sees the process of salvation as involving both divine initiative and human participation.
    - "Grace and freedom are not alternatives, but belong together in the event of salvation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Eschatological Realization of Human Nature**
    - Views human nature as fulfilled only in the eschatological future revealed in Christ.
    - Argues that the effects of sin and grace are fully understood only in light of the resurrection.
    - Sees the human person as oriented toward a future consummation in God.
    - Connects anthropology with the unfolding of **salvation history**.
    - "Human destiny is determined in the light of the resurrection, which reveals the true meaning of grace and freedom." (Jesus—God and Man)

5. **Christocentric Anthropology**
    - Grounds the understanding of sin, grace, and freedom in the person and work of Christ.
    - Christ is the revelation of true humanity and the locus of reconciliation.
    - Human nature is defined not abstractly, but in relation to Christ’s history.
    - The work of Christ mediates both the diagnosis of sin and the gift of new life.
    - "Only in Christ do we see what it means to be truly human, reconciled to God by grace." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s nuanced approach to **grace** and **freedom** has influenced contemporary debates on **original sin** and the relationship between divine sovereignty and human agency. His mediating position between Pelagian and Augustinian extremes has encouraged theologians to reconsider the dialectic of grace and freedom in light of **Christology** and eschatology. Pannenberg’s work remains a significant resource for those seeking to articulate a theologically robust anthropology that avoids both determinism and moralism.
