# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity—comprising the **Belgic Confession**, **Heidelberg Catechism**, and **Canons of Dort**—articulate a distinctly **Augustinian** stance on **sin**, **grace**, and **salvation** in opposition to both **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**. These confessions affirm the total inability of fallen humanity and the necessity of **sovereign, effectual grace** for salvation, rejecting any notion that the human will can cooperate with grace apart from divine initiative.

- "Therefore, all people are conceived in sin and are by nature children of wrath, incapable of any saving good, inclined to evil, dead in their sins, and slaves to sin." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.3)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 14–16
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 5–8, 20, 60, 65
- Canons of Dort (1619), esp. Heads of Doctrine III/IV and I
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard collected edition)
- The Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Inability**
   - Humanity is fallen in **Adam** and wholly unable to turn to God apart from grace.
   - The will is not merely weakened but **spiritually dead** and enslaved to sin.
   - All faculties—mind, heart, and will—are corrupted by original sin.
   - Any good in fallen man is insufficient for salvation.
   - "Therefore, all people are conceived in sin and are by nature children of wrath, incapable of any saving good, inclined to evil, dead in their sins, and slaves to sin." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.3)

2. **Sovereign, Effectual Grace**
   - Salvation is initiated and accomplished by **God’s sovereign grace** alone.
   - Regeneration is a work of the Holy Spirit, not a cooperation between God and man.
   - Grace is not merely an aid but the decisive cause of faith and repentance.
   - The human will is renewed and enabled by grace to respond to the gospel.
   - "Regeneration is not effected by the external preaching of the gospel alone, nor by moral persuasion, but by a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.12)

3. **Unconditional Election**
   - God’s choice of the elect is not based on foreseen faith or merit.
   - Election is rooted in God’s eternal purpose and good pleasure.
   - The elect are given faith and repentance as gifts, not as conditions met by their own will.
   - This doctrine excludes all forms of **Pelagian** or **Semi-Pelagian** synergism.
   - "Election is the unchangeable purpose of God whereby, before the foundation of the world, He has out of mere grace, according to the sovereign good pleasure of His own will, chosen...certain persons to redemption in Christ." (Canons of Dort, I.7)

4. **Rejection of Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism**
   - Pelagianism is rejected for denying original sin and affirming human ability to choose good unaided.
   - Semi-Pelagianism is rejected for positing a cooperative role for the human will in initial conversion.
   - The confessions insist that faith itself is a gift, not a human contribution.
   - Any doctrine that attributes the decisive cause of salvation to man is condemned.
   - "This is the regeneration so highly celebrated in Scripture...not only by the external preaching of the gospel, but also by an inward, supernatural work." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.12)

5. **Perseverance of the Saints**
   - Those effectually called and regenerated will persevere to the end by God’s preserving grace.
   - Perseverance is not grounded in human effort but in God’s faithfulness.
   - The saints may fall into sin, but cannot finally fall away from grace.
   - This doctrine underscores the monergistic nature of salvation from beginning to end.
   - "God...does not take His Holy Spirit from His own completely, even when they fall grievously." (Canons of Dort, V.6)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have decisively shaped **Reformed orthodoxy** on the doctrines of sin and grace, providing a robust confessional bulwark against both **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** errors. Their clear articulation of **Augustinian** soteriology has influenced Reformed churches worldwide and continues to serve as a standard for evaluating theological fidelity on issues of human depravity and divine grace. These confessions remain central to the identity and doctrinal boundaries of the continental Reformed tradition.
