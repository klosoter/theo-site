# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer critically engaged the debates between **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism**, emphasizing the centrality of **divine grace** and the radical nature of **human sin**. He argued that any theological system must uphold the utter dependence of humanity on **God’s initiative in salvation**, while also warning against deterministic tendencies that undermine human responsibility.

- "Grace is not a supplement to human effort, but the decisive factor in the entire work of salvation." (Sin, 1971)

## Key Works

- Sin (Studies in Dogmatics, 1971)
- Faith and Justification (Studies in Dogmatics, 1954)
- Divine Election (Studies in Dogmatics, 1960)
- Man: The Image of God (Studies in Dogmatics, 1962)
- The Providence of God (Studies in Dogmatics, 1952)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Radical Corruption**
    - Humanity’s fall into sin is total, affecting every aspect of human nature.
    - Berkouwer rejects any notion that humans retain a neutral or untainted will after the Fall.
    - He critiques **Pelagianism** for minimizing the depth of original sin.
    - True knowledge of sin leads to recognition of the necessity of grace.
    - "The radicality of sin excludes every Pelagian optimism." (Sin, 1971)

2. **Grace as Sovereign and Prevenient**
    - Salvation is initiated and accomplished solely by **God’s grace**.
    - Berkouwer opposes **Semi-Pelagian** views that posit a cooperative beginning to faith.
    - He affirms that grace precedes all human response.
    - Any human movement toward God is itself the result of grace.
    - "Grace is not a mere aid, but the source and ground of salvation." (Faith and Justification, 1954)

3. **Critique of Determinism**
    - While upholding **Augustinian** emphasis on grace, Berkouwer resists fatalistic interpretations.
    - He stresses that divine sovereignty does not nullify genuine human responsibility.
    - The mystery of the relationship between grace and will must be preserved.
    - Overly rigid systems distort the biblical witness.
    - "The biblical message resists both Pelagian autonomy and deterministic necessity." (Divine Election, 1960)

4. **Faith as Gift, Not Achievement**
    - Faith is not a human work or accomplishment.
    - Berkouwer insists that faith itself is a gift of God, not a product of human initiative.
    - He critiques any system that makes faith a precondition for grace.
    - This position stands against both **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** tendencies.
    - "Faith is not a human contribution, but a response awakened by grace." (Faith and Justification, 1954)

5. **Theological Humility and Mystery**
    - Berkouwer warns against speculative systematization of grace and free will.
    - He advocates for humility before the mystery of **divine sovereignty** and human response.
    - The tension between God’s initiative and human responsibility should not be resolved by philosophical constructs.
    - True theology listens to the whole of Scripture rather than forcing harmonization.
    - "The mystery of salvation is not to be explained away, but confessed in faith." (Divine Election, 1960)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced engagement with **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism** has shaped modern Reformed theology’s understanding of **grace** and **sin**. His insistence on the radicality of sin and the primacy of divine initiative influenced generations of theologians, especially within the Dutch Reformed tradition. By resisting both anthropocentric and deterministic extremes, Berkouwer modeled a theologically humble approach that remains influential in contemporary discussions of **soteriology** and human responsibility.
