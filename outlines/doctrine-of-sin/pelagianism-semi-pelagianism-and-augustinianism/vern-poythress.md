# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches the debates between **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism** from a robustly **Reformed** and **biblically grounded** perspective. He emphasizes the radical effects of the **Fall**, the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation, and the sovereignty of **God in regeneration**, aligning closely with classic Augustinian and Calvinistic convictions.

- "The biblical teaching is clear that salvation is by grace alone, not by human effort or initiative." (Symphonic Theology)

## Key Works

- Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology
- The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses
- Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach
- Inerrancy and Worldview
- "Modern Spirituality and the Reformation" (Westminster Theological Journal)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and the Effects of the Fall**
    - Humanity is radically corrupted in every aspect by the Fall.
    - No part of human nature remains untouched by sin.
    - This depravity renders humans unable to initiate salvation.
    - Any movement toward God must be the result of divine intervention.
    - "The Fall has affected every area of human life, including the will and understanding." (Symphonic Theology)

2. **Necessity of Sovereign Grace**
    - Salvation is entirely dependent on God's initiative.
    - Grace is not merely assistance but the decisive cause of regeneration.
    - Human will is powerless to choose God apart from grace.
    - This stands in stark contrast to both Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views.
    - "Grace is not a supplement to human effort, but the foundation of all spiritual life." (Symphonic Theology)

3. **Rejection of Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian Anthropology**
    - Pelagianism denies original sin and affirms human ability to choose good unaided.
    - Semi-Pelagianism allows for partial human initiative in salvation.
    - Both are incompatible with the biblical witness to human inability.
    - Poythress affirms the necessity of monergistic regeneration.
    - "Any theology that gives the initiative to man rather than God distorts the gospel." (Symphonic Theology)

4. **Biblical Authority and Theological Method**
    - Scripture is the ultimate authority for doctrinal formulation.
    - Theological categories must be derived from and tested by the biblical text.
    - Historical debates (like those on Pelagianism) are evaluated in light of Scripture.
    - Multiple perspectives in theology must be harmonized with biblical teaching.
    - "We must always return to Scripture as the final arbiter in theological disputes." (Symphonic Theology)

5. **God’s Sovereignty in Salvation**
    - God unconditionally elects and regenerates His people.
    - Human response is the result, not the cause, of divine grace.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on God's unchanging purpose.
    - This sovereignty is central to the Reformed and Augustinian tradition.
    - "God’s sovereignty ensures that salvation is secure and entirely of grace." (Symphonic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress has reinforced the **Augustinian** and **Reformed** understanding of grace and human inability within contemporary evangelical theology. His work has provided clarity on the dangers of **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** tendencies, especially in modern theological and pastoral contexts. By emphasizing the primacy of Scripture and the necessity of sovereign grace, he has shaped discussions on soteriology and the doctrine of man for a new generation of scholars and pastors.
