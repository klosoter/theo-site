# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. has consistently articulated a robustly **Reformed** and **Augustinian** stance on **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**, emphasizing the radical effects of the **Fall**, the necessity of **sovereign grace**, and the utter inability of fallen humanity to contribute to its own salvation. He upholds the priority of divine initiative in **regeneration** and the centrality of **union with Christ** for the application of redemption.

- "The decisive issue is not the degree of human depravity but the necessity and priority of sovereign, effectual grace." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul's Soteriology"
- "Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology" (in The Westminster Theological Journal)
- "The Holy Spirit: Perspectives on Pentecost"
- Contributions to "Theonomy and Eschatology: Reformed Perspectives"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and the Inability of Fallen Humanity**
   - Humanity after the Fall is wholly incapable of turning to God apart from divine initiative.
   - Rejects all forms of **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism** that posit any residual spiritual ability in fallen man.
   - Affirms that the will is bound by sin and cannot cooperate with grace prior to regeneration.
   - The necessity of **monergistic regeneration** is central to his anthropology.
   "The biblical teaching is that fallen man is not merely sick but dead in sin." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Sovereign Grace in Salvation**
   - Salvation is entirely the work of God from beginning to end.
   - Grace is not merely an aid but the decisive cause of faith and repentance.
   - Any cooperation from the human side is itself the result of prior divine action.
   - The initiative and efficacy of grace are non-negotiable in Gaffin’s soteriology.
   "Grace is not a supplement to human effort but the sole cause of salvation." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

3. **Rejection of Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian Anthropology**
   - Pelagianism is seen as a denial of original sin and the necessity of grace.
   - Semi-Pelagianism is critiqued for positing a synergistic view of conversion.
   - Both are incompatible with the Pauline doctrine of salvation by grace alone.
   - Gaffin insists on the radical difference between **Reformed** and Semi-Pelagian views.
   "Any notion that man takes the first step toward God is fundamentally un-Pauline." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

4. **Union with Christ as the Ground of Salvation**
   - All benefits of salvation, including regeneration and justification, flow from **union with Christ**.
   - This union is established by the Holy Spirit, not by human initiative.
   - The ordo salutis (order of salvation) is grounded in the historia salutis (history of salvation) accomplished by Christ.
   - Human faith is the instrument, not the cause, of union with Christ.
   "Union with Christ is the central soteriological reality from which all else flows." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

5. **Augustinian Priority of Divine Initiative**
   - Follows Augustine in asserting the priority of God’s action in salvation.
   - Human will is liberated only by the prior work of the Holy Spirit.
   - The **Reformed** tradition’s emphasis on predestination and effectual calling is upheld.
   - Any system that allows for autonomous human initiative is rejected as unbiblical.
   "The initiative in salvation is always and only with God." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has reinforced the **Augustinian** and **Reformed** understanding of grace and human inability within contemporary evangelical and Reformed circles. His careful exegesis of Paul and his polemics against **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism** have shaped generations of pastors and theologians, especially at Westminster Theological Seminary. Gaffin’s emphasis on **union with Christ** and the priority of sovereign grace remains a touchstone for discussions of soteriology and the doctrine of salvation.
