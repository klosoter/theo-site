# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached the debates of **Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and Augustinianism** with a robustly Reformed and biblical-theological framework. He upheld the **Augustinian** doctrine of **original sin**, **total depravity**, and the necessity of **sovereign grace**, sharply distinguishing these from the anthropological optimism of **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** positions.

- "The Pelagian conception of sin is not only unscriptural, but it is also unpsychological, for it fails to account for the universal and radical character of sin." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Christology
- The Pauline Eschatology
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology"
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Radical Depravity**
   - Humanity is wholly corrupted by **original sin** due to Adam’s fall.
   - There is no spiritual good remaining in man apart from grace.
   - Sin affects the entire person: intellect, will, and affections.
   - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views underestimate the depth of human corruption.
   - "The Reformed doctrine of total depravity is but the logical outcome of the Augustinian principle of original sin." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Grace as Sovereign and Efficacious**
   - Salvation is initiated and completed by **God’s sovereign grace** alone.
   - Human will is not a cooperating agent in regeneration.
   - Grace is not merely an aid but the decisive cause of spiritual life.
   - Semi-Pelagianism’s synergism is rejected as contrary to Scripture.
   - "Grace does not merely supplement human effort; it creates the new man." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
   - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity, and his guilt is imputed to all.
   - Christ, as the second Adam, brings righteousness by imputation to the elect.
   - Pelagian denial of imputation undermines the necessity of Christ’s work.
   - The covenantal structure is central to understanding sin and redemption.
   - "The forensic relation of Adam and Christ is the backbone of Pauline soteriology." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Scriptural Authority in Anthropology**
   - Anthropology must be shaped by **biblical revelation**, not philosophical speculation.
   - Pelagianism is critiqued for its rationalistic and optimistic anthropology.
   - Vos grounds his doctrine of man in the unfolding history of redemption.
   - The Reformed tradition is seen as faithfully reflecting the biblical witness.
   - "Scripture alone gives us the true diagnosis of man’s condition and the remedy in Christ." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective**
   - The history of redemption reveals the necessity of **divine initiative** in salvation.
   - Human inability is consistently demonstrated throughout redemptive history.
   - Augustinianism aligns with the biblical narrative of fall and restoration.
   - Pelagianism is incompatible with the progressive revelation of grace.
   - "The drama of redemption is unintelligible apart from the radical need for grace." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s defense of **Augustinianism** and critique of Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian tendencies reinforced the Reformed tradition’s commitment to the doctrines of **total depravity** and **sovereign grace**. His biblical-theological method provided a redemptive-historical context for understanding these debates, influencing generations of Reformed theologians. Vos’s work remains foundational for those seeking to articulate a consistently biblical anthropology and soteriology in opposition to anthropocentric distortions.
