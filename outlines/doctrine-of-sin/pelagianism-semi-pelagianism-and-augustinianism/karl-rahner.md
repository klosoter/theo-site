# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner engaged the debates surrounding **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism** through his distinctive approach to **grace**, **human freedom**, and **original sin**. Rahner sought to uphold the necessity and universality of **God’s grace** while emphasizing the **transcendental openness** of the human person, thus offering a nuanced alternative to both strict Augustinian predestination and Pelagian self-sufficiency.

- "Grace is everywhere, but it is not everywhere recognized." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Foundations of Christian Faith (Grundkurs des Glaubens)
- Nature and Grace: Dilemmas in the Modern Church
- Theological Investigations, Vol. 1: God, Christ, Mary and Grace
- "Concerning the Relationship between Nature and Grace" (Theological Investigations, Vol. 1)
- Grace in Freedom

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Grace is always prevenient and necessary**
    - Human beings are radically dependent on **God’s grace** for salvation.
    - Rahner rejects any notion of **Pelagianism** that posits unaided human effort as sufficient.
    - Even the natural openness to God is itself a result of grace.
    - Grace is not an external addition but the fulfillment of human nature.
    - "Man is always already addressed by God’s self-communication." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Transcendental anthropology and the supernatural existential**
    - Every person has a **supernatural existential**: a constant orientation toward God.
    - This existential is not earned but given by God’s initiative.
    - Human freedom is real, but always within the context of grace.
    - Rahner’s anthropology avoids both Pelagian optimism and Augustinian pessimism.
    - "The supernatural existential is the radical presupposition of the possibility of grace." (Nature and Grace)

3. **Rejection of strict predestinarianism**
    - Rahner critiques **Augustinianism** where it implies double predestination or denies genuine human freedom.
    - He insists on the universal salvific will of God.
    - Human response to grace is necessary, but itself enabled by grace.
    - Rahner seeks to balance divine sovereignty with authentic human cooperation.
    - "God’s grace is offered to all men, and no one is excluded from the possibility of salvation." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Sin as rejection of grace, not mere moral failure**
    - Sin is fundamentally the refusal of God’s self-communication.
    - Original sin is a condition, not just an act, but grace is always prior.
    - Rahner avoids both Pelagian denial of original sin and Augustinian overemphasis on human depravity.
    - Redemption is the restoration of the relationship with God, not just moral improvement.
    - "Sin is the rejection of the grace which is always already present." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 1)

5. **Nature and grace are intrinsically related**
    - Rahner rejects a strict dualism between **nature and grace**.
    - Human nature is always already graced, not a neutral substrate.
    - This view challenges both Pelagian naturalism and Augustinian nature-grace separation.
    - The supernatural is not an external supplement but the fulfillment of human destiny.
    - "Grace is the fulfillment of the essence of man, not something added from without." (Nature and Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s synthesis of **grace** and **freedom** has significantly shaped modern Catholic theology, especially in the wake of Vatican II. His rejection of both **Pelagianism** and a rigid **Augustinianism** provided a framework for understanding salvation that emphasizes both divine initiative and genuine human response. Rahner’s concept of the **supernatural existential** continues to influence discussions on nature, grace, and the universality of salvation. His work remains a touchstone for debates on the relationship between human nature and divine grace in contemporary theology.
