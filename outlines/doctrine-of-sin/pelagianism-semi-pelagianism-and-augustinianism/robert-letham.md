# Robert Letham (1947– )

Robert Letham is a contemporary Reformed theologian who robustly affirms **Augustinianism** over against **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**, emphasizing the primacy of **divine grace** in salvation and the pervasive effects of **original sin**. He consistently upholds the **Reformed doctrine of total depravity**, arguing that human will is utterly dependent on God's sovereign initiative for regeneration and faith.

- "Augustine’s doctrine of grace, in opposition to Pelagius, is foundational for the Reformed understanding of salvation." (Systematic Theology, 2019)

- The Work of Christ (2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Original Sin**
    - Humanity is radically corrupted by **original sin** due to Adam’s fall.
    - No part of human nature remains unaffected by sin, including the will.
    - Pelagianism is rejected for denying the necessity of grace in overcoming sin.
    - Semi-Pelagianism is critiqued for positing a cooperative role for the unaided human will.
    - "The Reformed tradition, following Augustine, insists that sin has rendered us incapable of turning to God apart from his grace." (Systematic Theology, 2019)

2. **Necessity and Priority of Divine Grace**
    - Salvation is initiated and completed by **God’s sovereign grace** alone.
    - Human beings contribute nothing to their regeneration or initial faith.
    - Grace is not merely assistance but the decisive cause of conversion.
    - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views are seen as undermining the sufficiency of grace.
    - "Grace is not a supplement to human effort but the very foundation of our salvation." (Systematic Theology, 2019)

3. **Monergism in Regeneration**
    - Regeneration is the work of the **Holy Spirit** alone (monergism).
    - The human will is passive in the act of being born again.
    - Any movement toward God is the result, not the cause, of regeneration.
    - This sharply contrasts with Semi-Pelagian synergism.
    - "The new birth is an act of God’s Spirit, not a cooperative venture between God and man." (Systematic Theology, 2019)

4. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam acts as the **federal head** of humanity; his sin is imputed to all.
    - Christ, as the second Adam, brings righteousness by his obedience.
    - Pelagian denial of inherited guilt is rejected as unbiblical.
    - The imputation of both sin and righteousness is central to Letham’s soteriology.
    - "The federal relationship of Adam and Christ is crucial for understanding both the problem of sin and the solution in Christ." (Systematic Theology, 2019)

5. **Historical and Confessional Continuity**
    - Letham grounds his theology in the **Augustinian** and **Reformed confessional** tradition.
    - He affirms the Westminster Standards’ articulation of grace and depravity.
    - He sees the Pelagian controversy as foundational for later Protestant orthodoxy.
    - The church’s historic rejection of Pelagianism is essential for doctrinal fidelity.
    - "The Westminster Confession stands squarely in the Augustinian tradition, utterly repudiating Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian errors." (The Westminster Assembly, 2009)

## Legacy and Impact

Robert Letham has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by articulating a clear, confessional stance on the issues of **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism**. His work has reinforced the centrality of **sovereign grace** and the necessity of divine initiative in salvation within the broader evangelical and Presbyterian communities. Letham’s scholarship ensures that the historic Augustinian-Reformed consensus remains a vital reference point in modern theological discourse.
