# Julian of Eclanum (c. 386–c. 455)

Julian of Eclanum was a leading defender of **Pelagianism** and a sharp critic of **Augustinianism** regarding **original sin**, **grace**, and **human free will**. He rejected the doctrine of inherited guilt, emphasizing the **innate goodness of human nature** and the capacity for moral choice apart from supernatural grace. Julian’s theology stands as a systematic alternative to both **Augustine’s predestinarianism** and later **Semi-Pelagian** mediations.

- "God is the creator only of natures, not of vices." (Contra Augustinum)

## Key Works

- Contra Augustinum (Against Augustine)
- Libri ad Turbantium
- Letters to Pope Zosimus
- Fragments preserved in Augustine’s anti-Pelagian writings
- Selections in Peter Brown, Augustine of Hippo: A Biography

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Denial of Original Sin**
   - Argued that **Adam’s sin** affected only himself, not his descendants.
   - Rejected the transmission of **guilt** or **corruption** to all humanity.
   - Saw **baptism** as a rite of initiation, not as a remedy for inherited sin.
   - Emphasized that each person is born as Adam was: morally neutral.
   - "No one is born in sin, but all become sinners by their own choice." (Contra Augustinum)

2. **Affirmation of Free Will**
   - Upheld the **freedom of the will** as essential to moral responsibility.
   - Denied that human nature is so weakened by the Fall as to be unable to choose good.
   - Taught that divine commands imply human ability to obey.
   - Criticized Augustine’s view as undermining human accountability.
   - "If it is not in our power to do good, then all divine commands are meaningless." (Contra Augustinum)

3. **Grace as Assistance, Not Transformation**
   - Defined **grace** as divine help or instruction, not an internal renewal.
   - Saw grace as external: law, teaching, and the example of Christ.
   - Denied the necessity of an **infused grace** for the will to choose good.
   - Asserted that grace aids, but does not determine, human action.
   - "Grace is given that we may do more easily what we could do by nature." (Fragments in Augustine, Contra Julianum)

4. **Goodness of Creation and Human Nature**
   - Maintained that **human nature** remains fundamentally good after the Fall.
   - Opposed any doctrine that would make God the author of evil or corruption.
   - Affirmed that all evil arises from free choice, not from nature.
   - Insisted that to deny the goodness of nature is to impugn the Creator.
   - "To accuse nature is to accuse the Creator of nature." (Contra Augustinum)

5. **Critique of Augustinian Predestination**
   - Rejected **unconditional election** and predestination to salvation or damnation.
   - Held that predestination is based on foreseen merit, not divine fiat.
   - Warned that Augustine’s doctrine leads to fatalism and moral laxity.
   - Emphasized universal **salvific will** and the possibility of salvation for all.
   - "God does not predestine anyone to evil; He foreknows, but does not cause, our choices." (Fragments in Augustine, Contra Julianum)

## Legacy and Impact

Julian of Eclanum became the most articulate and systematic exponent of **Pelagianism**, shaping the terms of the Western debate over **original sin** and **grace**. His opposition to Augustine forced the latter to clarify and defend his doctrines, deeply influencing the trajectory of Western theology. Though condemned as a heretic, Julian’s arguments continued to inform later **Semi-Pelagian** and even modern discussions on **free will** and the nature of sin. His legacy endures as a critical counterpoint to the Augustinian tradition.
