# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the controversies of **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism** through the lens of **Reformed anthropology** and the **Creator-creature distinction**. He consistently argued that only **Augustinianism**—with its affirmation of total depravity and sovereign grace—adequately preserves the biblical doctrine of salvation and the absolute dependence of the creature upon God.

- "It is only the Augustinian position that does full justice to the biblical doctrine of the absolute dependence of man upon God." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Creator-creature distinction**
   - God is wholly other and self-sufficient; all creaturely existence is dependent.
   - Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism blur this distinction by attributing autonomy to man.
   - Augustinianism alone maintains the ontological gap between God and man.
   - Human autonomy is a denial of the biblical doctrine of creation.
   - "The fundamental error of Pelagianism is its failure to maintain the absolute distinction between Creator and creature." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Total depravity and inability**
   - Human nature is radically corrupted by the Fall.
   - Pelagianism denies original sin; Semi-Pelagianism minimizes its effects.
   - Only Augustinianism affirms man's total inability to initiate or contribute to salvation.
   - Grace is not merely assistance but the sole cause of regeneration.
   - "The Reformed faith insists that man is dead in trespasses and sins, not merely sick." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

3. **Sovereign grace as the ground of salvation**
   - Salvation is entirely the work of God's sovereign grace.
   - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian schemes introduce synergism, undermining sola gratia.
   - Augustinianism upholds monergism: God alone regenerates and saves.
   - Any human contribution to salvation is excluded.
   - "Grace is not something added to human effort; it is the creative power of God alone." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Antithesis between belief and unbelief**
   - There is a fundamental antithesis between the regenerate and unregenerate mind.
   - Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism fail to recognize the noetic effects of sin.
   - Augustinianism affirms that only by grace can the mind be renewed.
   - The antithesis is epistemological as well as ethical.
   - "There is no neutral ground between the mind of Christ and the mind of the flesh." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Covenantal epistemology**
   - All human knowledge is covenantally conditioned: obedience or rebellion.
   - Pelagianism assumes the possibility of autonomous reason.
   - Augustinianism insists that true knowledge begins with the fear of the Lord.
   - The noetic effects of sin are overcome only by redemptive grace.
   - "All reasoning is either in submission to God or in rebellion against him." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of **Augustinianism** shaped 20th-century Reformed apologetics and theology, especially in his critique of human autonomy and synergism. His emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the antithesis between belief and unbelief provided a distinctive framework for evaluating Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian errors. Van Til’s thought continues to influence Reformed theologians and apologists, reinforcing the necessity of sovereign grace and the radical effects of the Fall in contemporary discussions of anthropology and soteriology.
