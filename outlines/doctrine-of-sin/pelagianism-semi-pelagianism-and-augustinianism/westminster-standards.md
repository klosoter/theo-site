# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** decisively reject **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**, affirming an uncompromisingly **Augustinian** view of **original sin**, **total depravity**, and **sovereign grace**. They maintain that salvation is entirely the work of God, from **effectual calling** to final perseverance, leaving no room for human initiative in regeneration or conversion.

- "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation..." (Westminster Confession of Faith 9.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- Westminster Larger Catechism
- Westminster Shorter Catechism
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge
- The Directory for Public Worship

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - Humanity is wholly corrupted by **original sin** due to Adam’s fall.
    - No person can will or do any spiritual good apart from divine grace.
    - The will is not free to choose God without prior regeneration.
    - This position directly opposes both Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian anthropology.
    "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation..." (WCF 9.3)

2. **Sovereign Grace in Salvation**
    - Salvation is initiated and accomplished solely by God’s sovereign will.
    - **Effectual calling** is the work of the Holy Spirit, not a response to human initiative.
    - Grace is not merely an aid but the decisive cause of faith and repentance.
    - Human cooperation is excluded from the inception of salvation.
    "All those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those only, he is pleased, in his appointed and accepted time, effectually to call..." (WCF 10.1)

3. **Rejection of Pelagianism**
    - Denies that humans can obey God or believe the gospel apart from grace.
    - Affirms that Adam’s sin brought guilt and corruption to all his descendants.
    - Asserts that human nature is not merely weakened but spiritually dead.
    - Upholds that salvation cannot be attained by moral effort or natural ability.
    "From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good..." (WCF 6.4)

4. **Rejection of Semi-Pelagianism**
    - Denies that the first movement toward God arises from human will.
    - Insists that faith itself is a gift, not a human contribution.
    - Opposes any synergistic cooperation in regeneration.
    - Asserts that prevenient grace is not given to all indiscriminately, but only to the elect.
    "This effectual call is of God’s free and special grace alone, not from anything at all foreseen in man..." (WCF 10.2)

5. **Augustinian Predestination**
    - God’s election is unconditional, grounded solely in his sovereign purpose.
    - The decree of **predestination** determines who will receive saving grace.
    - The reprobate are passed by, not on account of foreseen unbelief, but by God’s just will.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on God’s unchangeable decree, not human merit.
    "By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to everlasting death." (WCF 3.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped the **Reformed tradition’s** understanding of human nature, grace, and salvation, establishing a clear Augustinian orthodoxy that excludes both Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views. Their formulations remain foundational for Presbyterian and many other Reformed churches worldwide. By codifying these doctrines, the Standards have provided a bulwark against synergistic soteriologies and continue to serve as a touchstone for confessional fidelity in debates over **original sin** and **sovereign grace**.
