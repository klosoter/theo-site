# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame addresses the controversies of **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism** from a Reformed and presuppositional standpoint, emphasizing the absolute necessity of **divine grace** and the reality of **human depravity**. He critiques Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian positions for undermining the biblical doctrine of **salvation by grace alone**, and upholds the Augustinian and Reformed insistence on **monergistic regeneration**.

- "The biblical doctrine of grace is not that God helps those who help themselves, but that God helps those who cannot help themselves." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Key Works

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - Humanity after the Fall is entirely unable to choose or do spiritual good apart from **grace**.
    - **Pelagianism** is rejected for denying original sin and affirming human moral ability.
    - **Semi-Pelagianism** is critiqued for positing a cooperative role for human will in initiating salvation.
    - All good in salvation is the result of God’s prior work.
    "We are not able, apart from God’s grace, to make even the first move toward him." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

2. **Sovereign Grace and Monergism**
    - **Salvation** is wholly the work of God from beginning to end.
    - **Regeneration** precedes faith; God alone changes the heart.
    - Human will is freed only by the Spirit’s sovereign action.
    - Any synergistic scheme is seen as diminishing God’s glory in salvation.
    "God’s grace is not merely a helping hand, but the decisive cause of our salvation." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Covenantal Context of Salvation**
    - The doctrines of grace must be understood within the framework of God’s **covenantal** dealings.
    - The covenant highlights both God’s initiative and the creature’s dependence.
    - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views are seen as individualistic and non-covenantal.
    - **Augustinianism** is commended for its biblical-theological coherence.
    "God’s covenants always begin with his initiative, not ours." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Scriptural Authority and Sola Scriptura**
    - Frame grounds his rejection of Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism in the authority of **Scripture**.
    - He critiques traditions that elevate human reason or experience above biblical revelation.
    - The Augustinian/Reformed view is presented as the most faithful to the biblical witness.
    - Scripture’s teaching on sin and grace is non-negotiable for Christian theology.
    "The ultimate standard for theology is the Word of God, not human speculation." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

5. **Presuppositional Critique of Human Autonomy**
    - Frame applies a **presuppositional** critique to Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian anthropology.
    - He argues that all attempts to assert human autonomy in salvation are rooted in sinful self-assertion.
    - Only the Augustinian view properly acknowledges the **Creator-creature distinction**.
    - The denial of grace’s necessity is seen as a form of idolatry.
    "Any doctrine that attributes salvation to human autonomy is, at root, a denial of God’s lordship." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s robust defense of **Augustinianism** has reinforced the Reformed tradition’s commitment to the doctrines of grace and the necessity of divine initiative in salvation. His integration of **presuppositional apologetics** with systematic theology has provided a distinctive framework for critiquing Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian tendencies. Frame’s work continues to shape discussions on the relationship between human responsibility and **divine sovereignty** within confessional Reformed circles.
