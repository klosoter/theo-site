# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin was a staunch defender of **Augustinianism** against both **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**, emphasizing the utter dependence of fallen humanity on **divine grace** for salvation. He insisted on the **total depravity** of man, the necessity of **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit, and the **sovereignty of God** in election, sharply rejecting any notion that human will could initiate or contribute to salvation.

- "Man is so enslaved by the yoke of sin, that he cannot of his own nature aim at good either in wish or actual pursuit." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 2.3.5)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 1–5)
- Commentaries on Romans (notably Romans 5 and 8)
- Treatises Against the Libertines
- Sermons on Ephesians (especially Ephesians 2)
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - Humanity is thoroughly corrupted by **original sin** due to Adam’s fall.
    - No part of human nature remains untouched by sin; the will is in bondage.
    - Fallen man cannot choose or desire true good apart from **grace**.
    - This view stands in direct opposition to **Pelagianism’s** affirmation of human moral ability.
    - "All of us, who have descended from impure seed, are born infected with the contagion of sin." (Institutes, 2.1.5)

2. **Necessity and Efficacy of Divine Grace**
    - Salvation is initiated and accomplished solely by **God’s grace**.
    - Grace is not merely assistance but a transformative power that renews the will.
    - The human will is passive until acted upon by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - **Semi-Pelagianism’s** cooperation model is rejected; grace is not resistible or partial.
    - "The will is not restored to liberty, so as to be able to desire good, unless it be previously formed anew by the grace of God." (Institutes, 2.3.6)

3. **Unconditional Election**
    - God’s choice of the elect is not based on foreseen faith or merit.
    - Election is rooted in God’s **sovereign will** and purpose alone.
    - This doctrine underscores the **monergistic** nature of salvation.
    - Calvin opposes any synergistic or conditional view of election.
    - "God, by his eternal goodwill, appointed those whom he pleased unto salvation, rejecting the rest." (Institutes, 3.21.7)

4. **Rejection of Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian Anthropology**
    - Pelagianism is condemned for denying original sin and the necessity of grace.
    - Semi-Pelagianism is faulted for positing an initial human movement toward God.
    - Calvin insists that even the first stirrings of faith are gifts of God.
    - Any doctrine that allows for autonomous human initiative is seen as a denial of the gospel.
    - "We are so corrupt that we are wholly incapable of thinking or doing anything good of ourselves." (Commentary on Romans 7:18)

5. **Perseverance of the Saints**
    - Those whom God regenerates will persevere to the end by His sustaining grace.
    - Perseverance is not grounded in human effort but in God’s unchanging purpose.
    - This assurance flows from the same **Augustinian** convictions about grace and election.
    - The saints’ security is a direct consequence of God’s sovereign work, not human cooperation.
    - "The perseverance of the godly depends upon the election of God, and is joined with it by an indissoluble tie." (Institutes, 3.24.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust defense of **Augustinianism** shaped the doctrinal core of the Reformed tradition, especially in its opposition to **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** tendencies. His articulation of **total depravity**, **sovereign grace**, and **unconditional election** became foundational for later confessions such as the Canons of Dort and the Westminster Standards. Calvin’s influence endures in debates over the nature of grace, free will, and salvation, marking him as a pivotal figure in the history of Christian doctrine.
