# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the debates over **Pelagianism**, **Semi-Pelagianism**, and **Augustinianism** through his distinctive emphasis on **religious consciousness** and the feeling of absolute dependence. He rejected both the radical autonomy of Pelagianism and the deterministic overtones of Augustinianism, seeking a mediating position that reinterpreted **original sin**, **grace**, and **human freedom** within the framework of the individual's God-consciousness. Schleiermacher’s theology thus reframed traditional doctrines in light of the inner life of faith rather than inherited metaphysical categories.

- "Sin is not merely the sum of sinful acts, but a state of the God-consciousness being overpowered by sensuous self-consciousness." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Disordered God-Consciousness**
    - Sin is fundamentally a disruption in the **God-consciousness** rather than a legal or ontological stain.
    - Rejects the **Augustinian** notion of inherited guilt, focusing instead on the universal tendency toward self-assertion.
    - Views **original sin** as a universal condition, but not as a transmitted substance or guilt.
    - Emphasizes the experiential reality of alienation from God within the human spirit.
    - "Original sin is nothing but the universality of sinfulness, not a hereditary guilt." ("The Christian Faith")

2. **Grace as Divine Initiative in Consciousness**
    - **Grace** is the awakening and sustaining of God-consciousness in the individual.
    - Opposes Pelagian self-sufficiency by affirming the necessity of divine action for salvation.
    - Reinterprets **grace** as the ongoing presence of God in human experience, not a discrete infusion.
    - Stresses that all human response to God is enabled by prior divine initiative.
    - "All that is good in us is the effect of the divine Spirit upon our own." ("The Christian Faith")

3. **Freedom and Dependence**
    - Human freedom is real but always exercised within the context of **absolute dependence** on God.
    - Denies both Pelagian autonomy and Augustinian determinism, seeking a dynamic interplay.
    - Human will is shaped by the interplay of self-consciousness and God-consciousness.
    - True freedom is realized only in the surrender to God’s presence.
    - "The feeling of absolute dependence is the basis of all religion." ("The Christian Faith")

4. **Redefinition of Predestination**
    - Rejects classical **Augustinian predestination** as incompatible with the universality of God’s love.
    - Predestination is understood as the certainty of the triumph of God-consciousness in the community of believers.
    - Emphasizes the communal and historical realization of salvation rather than individual election.
    - Salvation history is the unfolding of God’s purpose in the world, not the arbitrary selection of individuals.
    - "The doctrine of election must be understood in the context of the community of faith." ("The Christian Faith")

5. **Christ as the Perfect God-Consciousness**
    - Christ is the unique bearer of perfect and uninterrupted **God-consciousness**.
    - Salvation is participation in Christ’s God-consciousness, not merely assent to doctrine or moral imitation.
    - Christ’s role is both exemplary and causative in awakening God-consciousness in others.
    - The work of Christ is the foundation for the possibility of overcoming sin and alienation.
    - "In Christ, the God-consciousness has become a real existence and a creative principle for humanity." ("The Christian Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **sin**, **grace**, and **human freedom** profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, shifting the focus from metaphysical debates to the phenomenology of religious experience. His mediating position between **Pelagianism** and **Augustinianism** paved the way for later liberal and existential theologies. While often criticized for downplaying traditional doctrines, his emphasis on **God-consciousness** remains foundational in discussions of human nature and divine action in contemporary theology.
