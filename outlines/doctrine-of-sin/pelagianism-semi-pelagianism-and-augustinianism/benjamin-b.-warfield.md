# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a staunch defender of **Augustinianism** in the face of **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** tendencies, emphasizing the utter dependence of human salvation on **divine grace**. He argued that **original sin** renders humanity incapable of self-redemption, making **regeneration** and **effectual calling** the exclusive work of God, in line with classic **Reformed soteriology**.

- "The difference between Augustine and Pelagius is the difference between a religion of absolute dependence on God and a religion of self-help." ("Augustine and His Work")

## Key Works

- "Augustine and His Work" (in *Calvin and Augustine*)
- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Theology of the Reformation"
- "Perfectionism"
- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Original Sin**
   - Humanity is utterly corrupted by **original sin** due to Adam's fall.
   - No human faculty remains untainted; the will is enslaved to sin.
   - Pelagianism denies this, asserting natural human ability to do good.
   - Semi-Pelagianism admits weakness but not total inability.
   - "The doctrine of original sin is the hinge on which the Augustinian system turns." ("Augustine and His Work")

2. **Necessity of Sovereign Grace**
   - Salvation is initiated and completed by **sovereign grace** alone.
   - Human will cannot cooperate with grace apart from prior regeneration.
   - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views compromise the sufficiency of grace.
   - Warfield insists grace is not merely assistance but the cause of new life.
   - "Grace is not merely necessary, but is itself the efficient cause of salvation." ("Augustine and His Work")

3. **Monergism in Regeneration**
   - Regeneration is the work of God alone (**monergism**), not a joint effort.
   - The human heart is spiritually dead until made alive by the Spirit.
   - Any synergistic view (Semi-Pelagianism) undermines the radical nature of sin.
   - Warfield aligns with Augustine and the Reformed tradition on this point.
   - "Regeneration is a creative act of God, not a cooperative enterprise." ("The Plan of Salvation")

4. **Rejection of Human Merit**
   - No human act or merit can contribute to justification or salvation.
   - Pelagianism’s optimism about human ability is fundamentally flawed.
   - Even faith is a gift, not a work or virtue that earns favor.
   - Warfield upholds **sola gratia** and **sola fide** as central.
   - "There is no room for human merit in the Augustinian scheme of salvation." ("The Theology of the Reformation")

5. **Historical and Theological Critique of Pelagianism**
   - Warfield traces the historical development and dangers of Pelagianism.
   - He sees Pelagianism as recurring wherever the church drifts from Augustinian roots.
   - Semi-Pelagianism is viewed as a persistent threat within Christian theology.
   - Warfield champions the **Reformed confessions** as bulwarks against these errors.
   - "Pelagianism is the ever-present heresy of the human heart." ("Augustine and His Work")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of **Augustinianism** shaped twentieth-century Reformed theology, especially in debates over **grace** and **human depravity**. His historical and theological analyses provided a framework for distinguishing orthodox Christianity from Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian distortions. Warfield’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of **soteriology**, ensuring that the centrality of divine grace remains a hallmark of confessional Reformed thought.
