# Pelagius (c. 354–418)

Pelagius was a British monk whose teachings on **human nature**, **free will**, and **grace** sparked major controversy in the early church, leading to the formulation of **Pelagianism**. He denied the doctrine of **original sin** and asserted that humans possess the natural ability to obey God's commands without the necessity of **divine grace** for the initiation of faith or good works.

- "If I ought, I can." (Letter to Demetrias)

## Key Works

- Letter to Demetrias
- Commentary on the Epistles of Paul
- Confession of Faith (fragments)
- De Natura (fragments)
- Augustine, On the Grace of Christ and On Original Sin (as a primary opponent and source on Pelagius’s views)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Denial of Original Sin**
   - Adam’s sin affected only himself, not the entire human race.
   - Each person is born morally neutral, without inherited guilt.
   - Human nature remains fundamentally good and uncorrupted by Adam’s fall.
   - Infants are born in the same state as Adam before the fall.
   - "Nothing impossible has been commanded by God, for it would be unjust to command what cannot be done." (Letter to Demetrias)

2. **Affirmation of Free Will**
   - Humans have full capacity to choose good or evil without coercion.
   - Moral responsibility presupposes the ability to obey or disobey God’s law.
   - Divine commands imply human ability to fulfill them.
   - Grace is helpful but not essential for the initial act of faith or obedience.
   - "We do either good or evil by our own will." (Commentary on Romans)

3. **Grace as External Assistance**
   - Grace is primarily the external help of God’s law and Christ’s teaching.
   - The role of grace is to instruct and encourage, not to regenerate or enable.
   - Grace is not an internal transformation but a moral example and exhortation.
   - The coming of Christ clarifies and strengthens the call to righteousness.
   - "Grace, indeed, assists our good purpose, but it is not the cause of it." (Letter to Demetrias)

4. **Possibility of Sinless Perfection**
   - It is possible for a person to live without sin through sustained effort.
   - The commands of God are achievable for all people at all times.
   - Saints of the Old and New Testaments are examples of sinless living.
   - Perfection is the goal and expectation for all Christians.
   - "It is possible for a man to be without sin, and easily possible if he desires it." (Letter to Demetrias)

5. **Rejection of Predestination**
   - God’s election is based on foreseen faith and obedience, not unconditional decree.
   - Salvation is universally available and not limited by divine choice.
   - Human cooperation is essential in the process of salvation.
   - Predestination undermines moral responsibility and the justice of God.
   - "God helps those who turn to Him of their own free will." (Commentary on Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

Pelagius’s teachings provoked a decisive response from **Augustine**, leading to the development of **Augustinianism** and the church’s formal condemnation of Pelagianism at several councils. His views forced the church to clarify doctrines of **original sin**, **grace**, and **human will**, shaping the trajectory of Western theology. While Pelagianism was rejected as heresy, debates over the nature of grace and free will continued to influence later controversies, including **Semi-Pelagianism** and the Reformation.
