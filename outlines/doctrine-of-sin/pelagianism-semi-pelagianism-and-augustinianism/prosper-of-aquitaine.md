# Prosper of Aquitaine (c. 390–c. 455)

Prosper of Aquitaine was a staunch defender of **Augustinianism** in the face of **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** challenges in the fifth century. He articulated a robust doctrine of **grace**, emphasizing the necessity of **divine initiative** in **salvation** and opposing any suggestion that human will could cooperate with God apart from prior grace. Prosper’s writings helped clarify the boundaries between **orthodox soteriology** and the errors of **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**.

- "It is not by the merit of the will, but by the gift of grace, that anyone is set free." (De Vocatione Omnium Gentium)

## Key Works

    - Upholds **unconditional election** and the primacy of **divine grace** in salvation.
    - Denies that human will can initiate or contribute to salvation apart from grace.
    - Argues that grace is **efficacious** and precedes any human response.
    - Insists that all good works are the result of God’s prior action.
    - "No one is set free except by the gift of grace." (De Vocatione Omnium Gentium)

2. **Rejection of Pelagianism**
    - Opposes the view that humans can achieve righteousness by natural powers.
    - Critiques the denial of **original sin** and the necessity of grace.
    - Asserts that Pelagianism undermines the need for Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Emphasizes the universality of human dependence on grace for salvation.
    - "The Pelagians attribute to human nature what belongs to the grace of Christ." (Contra Collatorem)

3. **Refutation of Semi-Pelagianism**
    - Argues against the idea that the first movement toward God originates in human will.
    - Maintains that even the desire to believe is a result of prevenient grace.
    - Warns that Semi-Pelagianism subtly reintroduces human merit into salvation.
    - Stresses that God’s grace is not merely cooperative but initiatory and decisive.
    - "It is not by our will that we come to faith, but by God’s mercy." (De Vocatione Omnium Gentium)

4. **Universal Call and Particular Election**
    - Teaches that the **gospel call** is genuinely extended to all nations.
    - Distinguishes between the external call and the internal, effectual call of the elect.
    - Affirms God’s sovereignty in granting faith to whom He wills.
    - Sees the universality of the call as compatible with particular election.
    - "The call is general, but the chosen are few by the secret judgment of God." (De Vocatione Omnium Gentium)

5. **Defense of Augustinian Orthodoxy**
    - Defends Augustine’s doctrines against misrepresentation and opposition.
    - Corresponds with church leaders to clarify and promote Augustinian teaching.
    - Seeks to unify the church around the doctrines of **grace** and **predestination**.
    - Argues that fidelity to Augustine is fidelity to apostolic truth.

## Legacy and Impact

Prosper of Aquitaine played a pivotal role in the consolidation of **Augustinian soteriology** in the Western church, especially in the debates against **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**. His writings influenced later councils and theologians, helping to secure the church’s commitment to the necessity and priority of **divine grace**. Prosper’s clear articulation of the distinction between the universal call and particular election shaped later Reformed and Catholic thought. His legacy endures as a key witness to the enduring relevance of Augustinian theology in the history of Christian doctrine.
