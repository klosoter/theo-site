### TITLE
Nature, Will, and Grace after the Fall: Contesting Pelagius with Augustine and the Semi-Pelagians

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Late antique to early medieval soteriology and anthropology located in **doctrine of sin and grace** with ramifications for **predestination** and **sacramental economy**.
- Core question is whether fallen humans can will and do the good without **effectual divine grace** or whether the will is in **bondage through original sin**.
- Principal figures include **Pelagius as moralist critic of Augustinian pessimism**, **Augustine as architect of original sin and prevenient grace**, **John Cassian and Faustus of Riez as mediating Semi-Pelagians**, and later **Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Trent, Dordt**.
- Key concepts include **original sin and inherited guilt**, **concupiscence and inability**, **prevenient and irresistible grace**, **free will compatibilism**, and **federal headship in Adam and Christ**.
- Major texts and events include **Carthage 418 condemnation of Pelagianism**, **Ephesus 431 reaffirmation**, **Orange 529 against Semi-Pelagianism**, **Trent 1546–1547 on sin and justification**, **Luther 1525 De Servo Arbitrio**, **Calvin 1559 Institutes**, **Dort 1618–1619 Canons**, **Westminster 1646–1647 Confession**.
- Reformed trajectories developed a high Augustinianism in **Old Princeton realism**, **Dutch Neo-Calvinist common grace**, and **Westminster federal anthropology**, in contrast with **Roman Catholic synergism** and **Lutheran monergism with distinct sacramentology**.
- Legacy debate continues around **freedom and responsibility**, **evolution and original sin**, **infant salvation**, and **analytic models of transmission**.

### ESSAY
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
The controversy between **Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and Augustinianism** centers on the state of the human will after the Fall and the necessity, priority, and efficacy of **divine grace**. At stake is the definition of **original sin** as corruption, guilt, and death transmitted from Adam to the human race, and the relation of nature and grace in the economy of salvation. The dispute belongs to **anthropology and soteriology** yet implicates **Christology** and **ecclesiology**, since Christ as the new Adam heals what Adam ruined and the church distributes grace through preaching and sacraments.

**Pelagianism** affirms that humans retain an unfallen **liberum arbitrium** and can fulfill divine commandments without interior transformation by grace, though grace is helpful as external law and example. **Semi-Pelagianism** concedes universal sin and the need of grace but posits a first step of faith arising from unaided will to which God responds with assisting grace. **Augustinianism** teaches that all humanity is a **massa perditionis** through Adam, that the will is bound by **concupiscence**, and that **prevenient and effectual grace** alone liberates the will unto faith and love.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
Genesis 3 portrays the primal transgression with covenantal consequences of **death, alienation, and curse**, which shape the narrative of Israel and the nations. Paul interprets the Fall in Romans 5.12–21 where through one man sin entered the world and death through sin, and death spread to all because all sinned. The crucial phrase *eph ho pantes hemarton* grounds **solidarity with Adam** and the universality of guilt and death. Augustine read the Latin in quo as in whom, which supported **real participation in Adam**, though later exegesis emphasizes causal and forensic connection.

Romans 3.9–20 declares all under sin with the noetic, volitional, and affective dimensions of **total depravity**, not absolute evil but pervasive bondage. Ephesians 2.1–5 speaks of being dead in trespasses and by nature children of wrath, with *phusei* marking a condition deserving **divine judgment** rather than a merely acquired habit. Johannine texts such as John 6.44 No one can come to me unless the Father draws him, and 1 Corinthians 2.14 The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit, underwrite **moral inability** and the need for **drawing grace**. Psalm 51.5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, though poetical, corroborates a doctrine of **innate corruption** rather than mere imitation.

The New Testament also grounds the antidote in **Christological headship**. Romans 5.18–19 and 1 Corinthians 15.22 link condemnation in Adam with justification and life in Christ. The structure of **imputation and union** supports Augustinian accounts of **federal headship**, while union by the Spirit grounds **regeneration** that precedes faith. The biblical pattern places **divine initiative** prior to human response, and treats faith itself as **gifted by grace**.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
Around 405–418 **Pelagius**, a British monk in Rome and later Palestine, taught that God commands only what humans can do, that Adam’s sin harmed himself alone, and that newborn infants are in Adamic mortality but not under Adamic guilt. His Letter to Demetrias and his Commentary on Romans argued for **moral ability** and for grace as law, example, and forgiveness rather than **interior renovation**. **Augustine of Hippo** responded in De Spiritu et Littera in 412, De Natura et Gratia in 415, and Contra Julianum in 421 with a sustained doctrine of **original guilt, concupiscence, and efficacious grace**.

Councils at **Carthage in 418** condemned Pelagian theses, including denial of infant baptism for the remission of sins, affirmation of natural ability, and the claim that grace is given according to merits. **Ephesus in 431** reaffirmed the condemnation as part of a wider settlement. A later movement in southern Gaul, associated with **John Cassian** and **Faustus of Riez** around 426–475, taught that the first movement toward faith can arise from the human will and that grace assists thereafter. The **Council of Orange in 529**, relying on Augustine and Prosper of Aquitaine, condemned Semi-Pelagian initiatory acts while affirming the universality of sin, the necessity of **prevenient grace**, and the gift character of perseverance.

Medieval scholasticism codified these trajectories. **Peter Lombard** gathered the sources in the Sentences. **Thomas Aquinas** in Summa Theologiae I–II question 109 taught that man needs **healing and elevating grace** for any salutary act, that the will can perform certain civil goods without grace, yet cannot begin to will the good of salvation apart from **divine prevenience**. Aquinas thus avoided Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian errors while articulating a rich account of habit and infusion.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
The Reformed synthesize Augustinian insights in **federal theology** and a robust doctrine of **total inability**. **Calvin** in the 1559 Institutes delineates the noetic effects of sin, the bondage of the will, and the necessity of **irresistible grace** in regeneration. The **Canons of Dort 1618–1619** respond to Remonstrant proposals by asserting the inability of the dead sinner to cooperate with grace and the **effectual calling** that infallibly brings the elect to faith. The **Westminster Confession 1646–1647**, chapter 6, affirms Adam as **covenant head**, the imputation of guilt, propagation of corruption, and the incapacity to will any spiritual good accompanying salvation until **regeneration**.

**Old Princeton** represented by **Charles Hodge** and **B. B. Warfield** defended a realistic yet federal view of **original sin**. Hodge’s Systematic Theology in 1872–1873 and Warfield’s essays on Augustine and the Pelagian controversy articulated **mediate imputation**, solidarity, and the necessity of **sovereign grace**. **Dutch Neo-Calvinism** in **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Bavinck** heightened Augustinianism while developing **common grace** to explain cultural goods and restraining grace among the unregenerate. Bavinck’s Reformed Dogmatics set **concupiscence and inability** within the broader drama of creation, fall, and redemption.

Reformed exegesis appeals to **Romans 5, Ephesians 2, and John 6** to anchor **bondage and effectual calling**. The anthropology is compatibilist, affirming that fallen actions are voluntary yet determined by **corrupt nature**, so moral responsibility remains, and the only liberator is **the Spirit’s regenerating work**.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
**Roman Catholic doctrine** condemns Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism while affirming **prevenient grace**. **Trent session V in 1546** teaches that Adam’s sin wounded nature and transmitted sin to all, that baptism removes guilt though concupiscence remains as **fomes peccati**. **Trent session VI in 1547** on justification asserts that the initiative of grace is prevenient and gratuitous, yet justification involves **cooperation** as grace heals the will to consent. Aquinas lies behind this synergy without collapsing into **self-initiated faith**.

**Lutheran theology** stands with **Augustinian monergism** on **the bondage of the will**. **Luther’s De Servo Arbitrio in 1525** contends that fallen humans cannot will the good apart from the **Word and Spirit**, and that faith is purely **gift**. The **Formula of Concord in 1577** rejects both Pelagian and synergistic positions, while its sacramental commitments accentuate the means by which **grace is delivered**.

Modern trajectories include **Wesleyan Arminian prevenient grace** that is universal and resistible, offsetting inherited inability without imputing damnable guilt to infants. **Schleiermacher** reconfigures sin as **God-consciousness diminution**, and **Ritschl** as ethical failure within community, both moving toward **Pelagianizing moralism**. **Charles Finney** in nineteenth-century revivalism taught moral government and denied **imputed guilt**, a stance close to **Pelagian denial of inherited guilt**.

Analytic theology has revisited **original sin** through models of **federal representation**, **realist participation**, and **condemnation by natural consequence**. **Oliver Crisp** proposes a moderate realism with federal features, while **Kevin Timpe** and **Robert Adams** discuss responsibility under **sourcehood conditions** rather than alternative possibilities. Debates over **compatibilism and libertarian freedom** draw on Frankfurt-style counterexamples and raise questions about the coherence of **moral inability** and culpability.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
One objection indicts **inherited guilt** as unjust since persons are liable for another’s act. Augustinians respond by appealing to **covenantal solidarity** and the structure of **Romans 5** where the same representational framework that condemns in Adam justifies in Christ. This symmetry suggests that rejection of **federal headship** jeopardizes **union with Christ** and **imputed righteousness**.

Another debate concerns **evolutionary origins**. If there was no single pair, how is **original sin** transmitted. Augustinian options include **genealogical Adam** within a larger population, **retrojection of covenant headship**, or models of **universal apostasy** under special revelation. Reformed thinkers argue that the dogmatic core is **universal corruption and death through a historical fall**, while exegetical latitude allows for various historical scenarios consistent with **Romans 5**.

Neuroscience and **free will** raise questions about **moral responsibility** under strong causal accounts. Compatibilists argue that responsibility tracks reasons-responsiveness and ownership rather than indeterminism. The Reformed claim that **regeneration** changes the heart’s dispositions without violating **creaturely freedom**. Pastoral questions persist regarding **infant salvation** and the fate of the unbaptized. The Reformed answer leans on **covenantal promise**, **electing grace**, and **Spirit-wrought union** that does not require conscious acts, while refusing **ex opere operato** accounts.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
The **Trinity** grounds the economy of **prevenient and effectual grace**. The Father elects, the Son merits, and the Spirit applies, displaying **inseparable operations** with a fitting order that preserves **monergism** in salvation. In **Christology**, the second Adam assumes our nature without sin, so his **active and passive obedience** becomes the means by which **imputed righteousness** answers **imputed guilt**. Union with the crucified and risen Lord through the Spirit heals **concupiscence** and reorders loves.

In **anthropology**, Augustine’s vision of the **will as love** shows that the problem is not lack of faculty but **disordered desire**. Nature remains good in ontology yet **vitiated in morality**, a doctrine of **privation** rather than Manichaean dualism. In **ecclesiology**, preaching and sacraments are instruments of **effectual calling**. Baptism signifies and seals remission of sins and introduces into the **covenant of grace**, though in Reformed teaching its efficacy is tied to **the Spirit’s timing**. In **ethics and sanctification**, the same grace that justifies also **renews the will**, securing **good works** as fruits rather than causes.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
A robust Augustinianism produces **humility, prayer, and hope**. Pastors teach penitents to confess **original sin** and actual sins, to renounce self-reliance, and to seek **grace that precedes and empowers**. The ancient **Kyrie eleison** and the collects of grace embody **prevenience**: we cannot please God apart from **the Spirit’s assistance**. Assurance rests not on the volatility of **free will** but on the stability of **divine promise** and **effectual calling**.

Catechesis should present **Adam and Christ** as covenant heads, trace **Romans 5** and **Ephesians 2**, and explain the difference between **moralism** and **gospel**. In counseling, the doctrine of **concupiscence and inability** reframes addictive patterns as bondage needing **liberating grace**, which drives to prayer, community, and sacramental participation. In mission, denying **Pelagian optimism** produces realistic expectations about **conversion**, leading to dependence on **word and Spirit** rather than technique.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
Against **Pelagian denial of inherited guilt** and **Semi-Pelagian first steps**, the church confesses with Augustine that sinners are saved only as **grace precedes, frees, and perfects the will** in Christ the second Adam.
