### ESSAY
To define the field with precision: Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and Augustinianism are rival construals of the relation between **original sin**, grace, and the human will in salvation. Pelagianism denies inherited guilt and the necessity of interior **prevenient grace** for the first motion of faith; grace is help but not the cause of believing. Semi-Pelagianism affirms the corruption of nature and the necessity of grace for growth and perseverance, but locates the initium fidei in the unaided or minimally aided will. Augustinianism asserts that fallen humanity is in the state of non posse non peccare, that the will is enslaved by concupiscence, and that both the beginning of faith and perseverance are gifts of **effectual grace** grounded in unconditional **predestination**. These are not mere difference of emphasis; they are metaphysically divergent accounts of causality, responsibility, and divine-human relations under the rule of **divine simplicity** and providence.

Pelagius stands at one pole. A British monk active in Rome in the late fourth and early fifth centuries, his moral intensity arose from pastoral alarm at laxity. His Letter to Demetrias and Commentary on Romans present a rigorous ethic built on the conviction that God’s commands imply human ability. He reads “Be perfect” as a sincere call that presupposes a natural capacity to obey. For Pelagius, Adam’s sin harmed posterity by bad example and the social spread of vice, not by transferring guilt or a corrupted nature. The will remains indifferent and capable of contrary choice at each moment. Grace is real but external: divine law, teaching, the exemplary obedience of Christ, and the remission offered in baptism. He admits infant baptism but denies it is for the remission of inherited guilt. He insists that many have achieved sinless perfection through strenuous asceticism. The soteriological engine is the unimpaired will, elevated by instruction and encouragement. The charge that Pelagius is a moralist who reduces grace to pedagogy and exemplar is not unfair; he explicitly defines grace as the created endowment of rational freedom plus the subsequent aids of revelation. Examiners sometimes press whether Pelagius denied grace altogether. The right answer is no; he affirmed grace, but he defined it thinly and extrinsically. He repudiated the idea that grace causes the first willing of faith. To the test whether Pelagius was condemned for saying something like what later Protestants say about moral responsibility, the answer is a clear negative: Pelagius denied **original sin** as guilt and denied the necessity of interior **prevenient grace** for conversion; those are precisely the propositions anathematized at Carthage and Ephesus.

Augustine of Hippo is the decisive counter. His theological formation through Scripture, anti-Manichaean controversies, and pastoral exposure to baptismal practice sharpened his sense that salvation must be of the Lord from beginning to end. In On Nature and Grace, On the Spirit and the Letter, and later in On the Predestination of the Saints and On the Gift of Perseverance, Augustine builds an integrated account of sin, grace, will, and predestination. His metaphysic of evil as privation preserves divine goodness under **divine simplicity**; evil is a deficiency in good wills, not a substance produced by God. His anthropology reads Romans 5 as teaching that Adam’s sin brought condemnation on all, now born under the reign of death and concupiscence. He will not divide nature from will: the will is part of nature. So a corrupted nature yields a bound will, what he labels non posse non peccare. In this condition, the will acts voluntarily and with preference, yet cannot rise to God. This is **compatibilist freedom** avant la lettre: free in acting according to one’s desires, unfree in relation to the truly good due to a morally disordered nature.

Grace, for Augustine, is not merely external assistance. It is the interior gift by the Holy Spirit that heals, enlightens, and delights the will, turning it to God. He distinguishes gratia praeveniens, which precedes and causes the first good motion, and gratia cooperans, which sustains and perfects. He calls faith itself a gift, citing Philippians 1 and Ephesians 2. The initium fidei is God’s work in us, not ours toward God. Perseverance to the end is likewise a specific gift bestowed on the elect. Predestination is God’s eternal purpose to bring some to faith and perseverance, not a bare foreknowledge of human choices. Yet Augustine carefully distinguishes God’s positive bestowal of grace from his just non-bestowal; he does not construct a symmetrical decree of damnation. To the recurrent examiner challenge, does Augustinianism make God the author of sin, Augustine replies through his doctrine of double agency: God as primary cause ordains and sustains all that exists, while sin is the deficient mode of a good nature’s act, for which secondary agents bear responsibility. Under **analogical knowledge**, we deny that causality in God and creatures is univocal; the same causal language cannot be flattened from the infinite to the finite.

Augustine’s pastoral application is unembarrassedly sacramental: infant baptism remits guilt because infants are guilty in Adam. Here the Reformed Augustinian must mark a line. Augustine’s soteriology is monergistic and thoroughly biblical; his sacramental doctrine, however, binds regeneration closely to the sacrament. The Reformed retain his monergism but relocate the instrumental cause to the preached Word applied by the Spirit in **effectual calling**, with baptism as sign and seal, not the efficient cause of regeneration. That differentiation is internal to Augustinianism’s reception and does not negate its doctrinal core.

Semi-Pelagianism arises as a pastoral and monastic corrector to Augustinian severity, especially in southern Gaul. Faustus of Riez is the definitive voice. A monk and later bishop, his treatise On Grace presents a carefully balanced rhetoric that confesses the fall while insisting on preserved libertas. For Faustus, grace is necessary in many ways, and he zealously denies the idea of predestination to evil. But he makes the initium fidei the act of the human will, which then receives grace for progress. He writes that God crowns our beginnings with grace. He accepts infant baptism and original sin as corruption but resists the claim that the will cannot begin to seek God without a prior interior work. In modern terms, Faustus represents synergism: the first motion toward God is ours, then grace cooperates. In opposing a reified double predestination he articulates an intuition many share: God cannot will evil. But his construction inevitably shifts causal primacy in salvation back to humanity, which Augustine refused. It is crucial to note the Council of Orange’s role here. Under Caesarius of Arles, Orange canonically rejected the Semi-Pelagian initium, insisting that even the beginning of faith is God’s gift and that no one can will or choose the good apart from **prevenient grace**. Orange did not endorse a symmetrical decree of reprobation, but it decisively ruled out Semi-Pelagianism. To the objection that Augustinian predestination was rejected at Orange, the reply is more precise: Orange affirms Augustinian monergism on the initium fidei and perseverance while bracketing further speculative claims about the mode of reprobation.

Prosper of Aquitaine, a lay intellectual and disciple of Augustine, was the most effective public defender of Augustinian grace in Gaul. His Against the Collator challenges the Cassianic thesis that the will can begin faith, showing how such a thesis undermines prayer and thanksgiving. If the initium is ours, then the decisive soteriological act is ours and doxology is misdirected. Prosper’s On the Calling of the Nations helpfully reframes the universality of the gospel in line with providence: grace calls peoples widely, but not all individuals are granted the internal gift. He insists that when Scripture says God wills all to be saved, it declares God’s saving will without specifying each mode of its execution. Prosper’s intellectual contribution is to pull Augustine’s doctrines into a broadly ecclesial and missional horizon: predestination is not a speculative curiosity; it is a doxological and pastoral claim that salvation is God’s work, securing humility and prayer. Examiners often test whether Prosper softens Augustine. He does not; he clarifies that predestination to life is God’s gift and that reprobation is a just leaving in sin. He is also a historical bridge to Orange and the centuries of Augustinian reception that follow.

John Calvin is the most mature Reformed Augustinian. In the Institutes and Bondage and Liberation of the Will, he reasserts the Augustinian thesis that all good in us is a gift of God, that faith is created by the Spirit through the Word, and that perseverance is a grace given to the elect. Where Calvin goes beyond Augustine is not in harshness but in analytical clarity. He frames **double predestination** as two aspects of one decree, not as symmetrical causality. Election is the decree to give saving grace in Christ; reprobation is the just decree to pass over and to ordain punishment for sin. His doctrine of **providence** secures the relation of primary and secondary causes, rejecting the claim that divine certainty collapses contingency or responsibility. He formalizes **federal theology**, integrating **original sin** into a covenantal structure. Adam functioned as federal head so that guilt is imputed to his posterity; Christ as second Adam bears guilt and imputes righteousness to his people. This is not a departure from Augustine but a juridical clarification of his realism of concupiscence. Calvin also relocates the locus of assurance and the application of grace to union with Christ. The Spirit’s **effectual calling** unites the elect to Christ, conferring the whole **ordo salutis** in seed. Faith itself is the bond of union, granted by God. He resists any notion that the regenerate can finally fall away, a position Augustine also held late in his career by making perseverance a distinct gift.

Internal debates within Augustinianism center on three pressure points. First, the metaphysics of freedom. Augustine and Calvin are **compatibilists**; the will is free when acting voluntarily according to its nature and desires. Medieval Augustinians like Thomas later refined this with a more detailed account of potency and act, while still denying the Pelagian indifferent will under sin. Second, the mode of reprobation. Augustine denied symmetric predestination. Reformed scholastics distinguish between the negative and positive aspects of the decree, protecting divine justice and secondary causes. When examiners ask if unconditional election necessitates reprobation in the same way, the answer is that the two sides operate under different causal descriptions: God positively bestows grace to elect; he justly withholds and permits sin and punishment for the rest. Third, means and monergism. The Spirit’s **effectual grace** does not negate means; it renders them efficacious. Augustine prayed and preached; Prosper argues that predestination energizes missions. Calvin integrates Word and sacrament as instrumental means under the Spirit’s sovereign agency. The monergism is not quietist. It is precisely because God works in us to will and to do that we work.

External debates sharpen the profile. Pelagianism, properly speaking, is not the position of later Arminians or Wesleyans. Arminius and his followers affirmed **original sin** and the necessity of **prevenient grace**, but made such grace universal and resistible. That is a more sophisticated synergism, not Pelagianism, and it retrieves the Semi-Pelagian impulse in a distinct register. Roman Catholic doctrine post-Trent rejects Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism and affirms **prevenient grace**, yet places the decisive role of free cooperation in a way that Reformed Augustinians judge synergistic. Eastern Orthodox theology affirms ancestral sin and synergy throughout, often rejecting legal imputation; its anthropology is more medicinal but still does not grant that the initium fidei is monergistic. Modern libertarian accounts of free will insist that responsibility requires the categorical ability to do otherwise in the same conditions, which Augustinian compatibilism denies.

Contemporary debates render the ancient issues urgent. Analytic philosophy of religion has refined the coherence of **compatibilist freedom** under exhaustive **providence**, exploring Frankfurt-style counterexamples to the principle of alternative possibilities and careful accounts of sourcehood. These developments arguably strengthen the Augustinian case that moral responsibility turns on deep ownership of action, not on the power of contrary choice. Open theism’s claim that God does not know the future free acts of creatures resurrects a Pelagian instinct in metaphysics, trading divine sovereignty and **divine simplicity** for univocal freedom and relational risk. Neuroscience, invoked to deny free will, is a false ally to Augustinianism. Augustinianism denies libertarian power in the unregenerate, not agency as such. If anything, the empirical demonstration that desires and habits govern the will underlines the biblical portrait of bondage to sin. Pastoral concerns around trauma and social conditioning call for a nuanced account of culpability at the level of individual acts, but they do not abolish the universal solidarity in Adam that grounds the need for grace.

I defend Augustinian monergism. First, Scripture. The argument does not begin with speculation but with the exegesis that compelled Augustine. Romans 5 teaches a real solidarity of guilt and death in Adam. Ephesians 2 describes the unregenerate as dead in trespasses and under wrath, saved by grace through faith, and specifies that this is not from ourselves. John 6 is devastating to synergism: no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; all that the Father gives me will come to me. These are not diagnostic slogans but soteriological causal claims. Romans 9 seals the case about **predestination** to mercy grounded in God’s purpose according to election, not in foreseen works or willing. If an examiner contests the reading of Romans 9 as national rather than individual, the point persists: Paul answers the charge of unfairness by appealing to God’s right as potter and to the display of mercy and justice, which does not apply coherently if the referent is only corporate destiny with individual contingency.

Second, metaphysical coherence. Augustinianism is not a fatalism. Under **divine simplicity**, God eternally wills himself and wills creatures in a single act, while creatures act through secondary causes. The necessity of the decree is not a coercion in the order of nature; it is the certainty of God’s infallible purpose. **Compatibilist freedom** secures responsibility because agents act according to their character and reasons. Sin as privation avoids the pitfall of making God the efficient cause of evil; moral evil is a defect in the mode of a creature’s action, not a positive entity. The Augustinian distinction between God’s willing to permit and his willing to effect is not a cosmetic move. It names differing relations between divine causality and the good of creatures. As applied to reprobation, God does not infuse evil or produce unbelief as unbelief; he withholds **effectual grace** and permits the sinner’s self-immolation, then justly punishes.

Third, catholicity and humility. Orange anathematizes Semi-Pelagian initium and affirms **prevenient grace**. The medieval and Reformed developments secure the same core. Augustine’s loci preserve doxology and prayer, since God’s grace precedes and causes our seeking. The Semi-Pelagian and Arminian schemes redirect the decisive soteriological cause to the human will, endangering humility, thanksgiving, and assurance. Conversely, the objection that Augustinianism kills evangelism and prayer is empirical and theological nonsense. Augustine, Prosper, Calvin, and the missionary enterprises nourished by Reformed churches testify otherwise. The decree establishes the means. The Spirit’s **effectual calling** comes through preaching. Prayer is energized by confidence that God can turn hearts of stone to flesh.

Two pressing examiner objections deserve explicit answers. First, is it unjust for God to condemn us for Adam’s sin. The reply is twofold. Solidarity with Adam is not a legal fiction but the structure of creation. Adam was not a private person; he was the public person of humanity under a covenant. His act is truly ours under **federal headship** and natural propagation. Scripture consistently reasons with this solidarity. Furthermore, your protest only makes sense if you want a salvation severed from Christ’s **federal** headship. If you refuse Adam as your representative, you lose Christ as your representative. Second, does monergism obliterate moral effort and sanctification. No, because **effectual grace** reconstitutes the will, granting a new delight in the law. Sanctification is synergistic in the regenerate in a derivative sense; God works in us such that we work. The ground and cause of our working remains grace. The Reformed doctrine of union with Christ clarifies this: we work from union, not toward it.

Finally, we must register where Augustine’s own formulations require cautious reception. His sacramental proximity of regeneration to baptism cannot be followed without qualification. His willingness to speculate about infants dying unbaptized we should not imitate. His pastoral willingness to assign perseverance as a distinct gift must be framed within the New Testament’s robust warnings. Yet these are adjustments inside the Augustinian house. On the defining questions of **original sin**, **prevenient grace**, the initium fidei, and **predestination**, Augustine is right. Pelagius evacuates grace by making it a spectator of autonomous virtue. Faustus resurrects human primacy by making our willing the decisive first mover. Prosper correctly sees that this redirects glory to man. Calvin integrates and clarifies the Augustinian inheritance, binding it to a rich doctrine of **providence** and covenant.

The contemporary church navigates the same fault lines, often under new vocabulary. Appeals to human dignity and responsibility must not be used to reinstall Semi-Pelagian premises. Appeals to divine love must not be defined against **divine simplicity** and sovereignty. Pastoral urgency demands we say what Scripture says. People do not need coaching toward heaven; they need resurrection. The gospel is not a therapeutic nudge; it is a creative fiat. The Spirit’s **effectual calling** is the decisive cause of faith. We preach, we pray, we baptize, and we teach, not because we trust the unaided will to take the first step, but because we trust the God who raises the dead. That trust supplies the theological architecture of humility, assurance, and mission that the church requires in every age.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Pelagianism denies inherited guilt and the necessity of interior **prevenient grace** for the initium fidei; Semi-Pelagianism affirms corruption and grace but makes the first motion toward God human; Augustinianism makes both the beginning of faith and perseverance gifts of **effectual grace** grounded in unconditional **predestination**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine of Hippo: monergistic grace, **compatibilist freedom**, predestination, perseverance as gift.
  - Pelagius: denies **original sin** as guilt, grace as law and example, libertarian free will and possible perfection.
  - Faustus of Riez: synergistic initium fidei, grace for progress, rejection of predestination to evil.
  - Prosper of Aquitaine: Augustinian defender, initium as gift, missions and prayer under predestination.
  - John Calvin: Reformed Augustinian, **double predestination** asymmetrically construed, **federal theology**, **effectual calling**.
- Debates:
  - Internal: compatibilism vs alternative accounts, asymmetry of reprobation, grace and means, sacramental mediation.
  - External: Pelagian naturalism, Semi-Pelagian synergism, Arminian and Wesleyan universal **prevenient grace**, Eastern synergy.
  - Contemporary: libertarian vs **compatibilist freedom**, open theism vs exhaustive **providence**, neuroscience and agency.
- Defended position: Augustinian monergism in which God grants the initium fidei and perseverance, preserving responsibility through **compatibilist freedom** and grounding salvation in **predestination** under **divine simplicity**.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does Augustinianism make God the author of sin? No; sin is privation and God’s causality differs from creaturely, with permission and secondary causes preserving responsibility.
  - Is Orange anti-Augustinian? No; it condemns Semi-Pelagian initium and affirms **prevenient grace**, while not defining reprobation.
  - How is Adam’s guilt ours? By **federal headship** and natural solidarity; the same structure grounds imputation in Christ.
  - Does monergism kill evangelism and prayer? No; **effectual grace** works through means, so predestination energizes missions and intercession.
  - What of Augustine’s baptismal views? Receive his monergism; relocate instrumental efficiency to Word and Spirit, with baptism as sign and seal.
