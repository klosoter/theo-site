# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth decisively rejected both **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**, insisting on the absolute primacy of **divine grace** and the utter incapacity of fallen humanity to contribute to its own salvation. Barth’s **Augustinianism** is distinctive: while affirming the radical effects of **original sin** and the necessity of **grace alone**, he reinterprets these doctrines christologically, centering all election and reconciliation in **Jesus Christ**.

- "Grace is the divine answer to the question posed by sin, and it is an answer which man cannot give himself." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics II/2 (The Doctrine of God: The Election of God)
- Church Dogmatics IV/1 (The Doctrine of Reconciliation)
- The Humanity of God
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- Karl Barth: Against Hegemony (George Hunsinger)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Rejection of Pelagianism**
    - Asserts that **human nature** is radically corrupted by sin and incapable of self-redemption.
    - Denies any human initiative or cooperation in the work of salvation.
    - Sees **Pelagianism** as a fundamental misunderstanding of both sin and grace.
    - Emphasizes the utter necessity of **God’s sovereign action** in salvation.
    - "Pelagianism is the most radical and consistent misunderstanding of the Christian message." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

2. **Critique of Semi-Pelagianism**
    - Rejects any synergistic model where human will cooperates with grace.
    - Argues that even the faintest human response is itself a work of **grace**.
    - Sees **Semi-Pelagianism** as a subtle form of self-assertion before God.
    - Maintains that salvation is monergistic, not synergistic.
    - "There is no cooperation between God and man; there is only the act of God." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

3. **Christocentric Augustinianism**
    - Reinterprets **Augustinian** doctrines of sin and grace through the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Locates both **election** and **reprobation** in Christ, not in abstract decrees.
    - Affirms the total depravity of humanity, but insists that Christ is the true Elect and Rejected One.
    - Sees all humanity as included in Christ’s redemptive work.
    - "In Jesus Christ, God has chosen man for Himself and Himself for man." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

4. **Universal Scope of Grace**
    - Stresses the objective reality of reconciliation accomplished in Christ for all.
    - Avoids classical **double predestination** by rooting election in Christ’s person.
    - Emphasizes the cosmic and universal dimensions of Christ’s atonement.
    - Maintains that the grace of God precedes and grounds all human response.
    - "The grace of God is not a possibility, but a reality accomplished in Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

5. **Sin as Radical Alienation**
    - Defines **sin** as a deep-seated alienation from God, not merely a series of acts.
    - Argues that human beings are incapable of returning to God apart from divine initiative.
    - Sees the **bondage of the will** as total, echoing and radicalizing Augustinian thought.
    - Insists that only the Word of God can break through human alienation.
    - "Sin is the contradiction of man’s being as determined by God." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s robust critique of **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism** reinvigorated the doctrine of **grace alone** in twentieth-century theology. His **Christocentric Augustinianism** shaped the contours of modern Protestant thought, challenging both liberal and conservative paradigms. Barth’s influence persists in contemporary debates over **election**, **universalism**, and the nature of **human agency** in salvation. His work remains a touchstone for discussions of grace, sin, and the sovereignty of God.
