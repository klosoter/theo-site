# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen staunchly defended **Augustinianism** against the errors of **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**, emphasizing the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation and the pervasive effects of **original sin**. He critiqued any theological system that diminished the seriousness of human depravity or the absolute dependence on **Christ’s atonement**, aligning himself with the historic **Reformed doctrine of total depravity**.

- "The grace of God is not merely an aid to human effort, but the creative force that alone can bring the dead to life." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Key Works

- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- The Christian View of Man (published posthumously, 1947)
- What Is Faith? (1925)
- The Origin of Paul's Religion (1921)
- Selected articles and lectures on sin and grace

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Original Sin**
    - Humanity is utterly fallen and incapable of self-redemption.
    - **Original sin** affects every aspect of human nature.
    - Pelagianism is rejected for denying the depth of human corruption.
    - Only **divine intervention** can overcome spiritual death.
    - "According to the Bible, man is lost in sin and cannot save himself." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Necessity of Sovereign Grace**
    - Salvation is entirely a work of **God’s sovereign grace**.
    - Human will is powerless to initiate or contribute to regeneration.
    - Semi-Pelagianism is critiqued for attributing any saving initiative to man.
    - Grace is not a supplement to human effort but the sole cause of salvation.
    - "If salvation is by grace, it is not by human merit in any degree." (What Is Faith?)

3. **Centrality of Christ’s Atonement**
    - The work of **Christ** is the only ground for acceptance with God.
    - Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views undermine the necessity of the cross.
    - Faith is trust in Christ’s finished work, not human achievement.
    - The atonement is effective only for those united to Christ by faith.
    - "The gospel is not an exhortation to save ourselves but a declaration of what God has done." (Christianity and Liberalism)

4. **Authority of Scripture**
    - Scripture alone defines the doctrines of sin and grace.
    - Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism are seen as departures from biblical teaching.
    - The Reformed confessions faithfully summarize the biblical doctrine.
    - The Bible’s anthropology is fundamentally Augustinian.
    - "The Bible presents man as lost and helpless apart from the supernatural work of God." (The Christian View of Man)

5. **Rejection of Human Autonomy in Salvation**
    - Any assertion of human ability in salvation is a denial of the gospel.
    - The Reformed tradition’s emphasis on monergism is essential.
    - Pelagianism is viewed as a form of rationalistic optimism.
    - True Christianity humbles man and exalts God’s initiative.
    - "The fundamental fault of the modern Church is that it is busily engaged in an absolutely impossible task—calling the righteous to repentance." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s robust defense of **Augustinian anthropology** and the necessity of **sovereign grace** shaped 20th-century American Presbyterianism and the broader evangelical movement. His critique of **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism** reinforced the centrality of the Reformed doctrine of salvation by grace alone. Machen’s influence endures in confessional Reformed circles, particularly through his insistence on the authority of Scripture and the seriousness of human sin. His legacy remains vital for those upholding the distinctives of historic Reformed theology.
