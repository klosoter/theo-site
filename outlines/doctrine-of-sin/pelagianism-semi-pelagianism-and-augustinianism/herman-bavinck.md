# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck robustly defended **Augustinianism** in the doctrines of **sin** and **grace**, sharply distinguishing it from both **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism**. He argued that human nature is radically corrupted by **original sin**, rendering salvation entirely dependent on **divine grace** rather than human initiative or cooperation.

- "Grace is not a supplement to nature, but a recreation of it." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation
- "The Sacrifice of Praise" (sermons and essays)
- Herman Bavinck on Preaching and Preachers (relevant for his views on grace and human inability)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Original Sin**
   - Humanity is wholly corrupted by **original sin** after the Fall.
   - There is no area of human life untouched by the effects of sin.
   - Human will is enslaved and cannot turn to God unaided.
   - Sin is both guilt and pollution, inherited from Adam.
   - "Sin is not merely an act but a condition, a state in which man finds himself." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

2. **Necessity of Sovereign Grace**
   - Salvation is initiated and completed by **God’s sovereign grace** alone.
   - Grace is not merely assistance but a total re-creation of the sinner.
   - Human cooperation plays no role in the inception of salvation.
   - Grace is both prevenient and efficacious, overcoming human inability.
   - "Grace does not merely heal but makes alive those who are dead in sin." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

3. **Rejection of Pelagianism**
   - Pelagianism denies the necessity of grace for salvation.
   - It affirms the natural ability of humans to obey God’s law.
   - Bavinck sees this as a fundamental denial of the gospel.
   - Pelagianism is incompatible with the biblical doctrine of sin.
   - "Pelagianism is the radical denial of original sin and the absolute necessity of grace." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

4. **Critique of Semi-Pelagianism**
   - Semi-Pelagianism allows for human initiative in the first step toward God.
   - Bavinck argues this undermines the totality of human depravity.
   - It introduces synergism, compromising the monergistic nature of salvation.
   - Even the faintest cooperation is excluded in true Augustinianism.
   - "Semi-Pelagianism is a halfway house that ultimately fails to do justice to the depth of human sin." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

5. **Augustinian Monergism**
   - Bavinck aligns with **Augustine** in affirming monergistic salvation.
   - Regeneration is a unilateral act of God, not a cooperative process.
   - Faith itself is a gift, not a human achievement.
   - Assurance and perseverance are grounded in God’s unchanging grace.
   - "Augustine’s doctrine of grace is the foundation of the Reformed faith." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s clear articulation of **Augustinianism** has profoundly shaped modern **Reformed theology**, especially in debates over **human depravity** and **divine grace**. His nuanced engagement with **Pelagianism** and **Semi-Pelagianism** continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of salvation and the necessity of grace. Bavinck’s synthesis of historical theology and biblical exegesis remains a touchstone for those defending the monergistic character of redemption.
