# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of the **nature and origin of sin**, emphasizing **original sin**, the **federal headship of Adam**, and the **total depravity** of humanity. Sin is defined as any **want of conformity unto, or transgression of, the law of God**, and its origin is traced to Adam’s first transgression, which is imputed to all his posterity. The Standards maintain that God is not the author of sin, yet in His **sovereignty** He permitted the fall for His own holy ends.

- "They being the root, and by God’s appointment, standing in the room and stead of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed; and the same death in sin and corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity." (Westminster Confession of Faith 6.3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin and Federal Headship**
   - Adam acted as the **federal representative** of all humanity.
   - Adam’s first sin resulted in the **imputation of guilt** and **corruption of nature** to all his descendants.
   - All mankind descending from Adam by ordinary generation inherit this sinful state.
   - The **corruption of original sin** extends to every part of human nature.
   - "The covenant being made with Adam, not only for himself, but for his posterity, all mankind... sinned in him, and fell with him in that first transgression." (WSC Q.16)

2. **Definition and Extent of Sin**
   - Sin is any **want of conformity unto, or transgression of, the law of God**.
   - Both **original** and **actual sins** are included in this definition.
   - Sin affects all faculties: mind, will, affections, and body.
   - Even the best works of believers are imperfect and defiled by sin.
   - "Sin is any want of conformity unto, or transgression of, the law of God." (WSC Q.14)

3. **Total Depravity**
   - The fall brought all mankind into an estate of **sin and misery**.
   - Human nature is wholly corrupted, making man unable to do any spiritual good.
   - The will is enslaved to sin, apart from regenerating grace.
   - This depravity is radical but does not destroy the image of God.
   - "From this original corruption... do proceed all actual transgressions." (WCF 6.4)

4. **God’s Sovereignty and Non-Complicity**
   - God ordained the fall for His own wise and holy ends.
   - He is not the **author of sin**, nor does He approve or tempt to evil.
   - God’s providence includes permitting, ordering, and governing all events, including the fall.
   - The mystery of God’s sovereignty and human responsibility is maintained.
   - "God, from all eternity, did... ordain whatsoever comes to pass; yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin..." (WCF 3.1)

5. **Transmission and Remedy of Sin**
   - Sin is transmitted by **ordinary generation** from Adam to all his descendants.
   - Christ, as the second Adam, provides the only remedy through His obedience and sacrifice.
   - Regeneration by the Holy Spirit is necessary to overcome the bondage of sin.
   - The guilt and corruption of sin are pardoned and mortified in believers, but not fully eradicated in this life.
   - "The corruption of nature, during this life, doth remain in those that are regenerated..." (WCF 6.5)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology’s doctrine of sin**, influencing confessional churches and theological education worldwide. Their careful articulation of **original sin**, **total depravity**, and the relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility remains foundational for Presbyterian and broader Reformed traditions. The Standards continue to serve as a benchmark for orthodoxy and a resource for addressing contemporary questions about human nature, sin, and redemption.
