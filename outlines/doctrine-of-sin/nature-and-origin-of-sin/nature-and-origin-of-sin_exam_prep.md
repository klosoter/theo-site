### ESSAY
The nature and origin of **sin** must be stated with conceptual strictness. Sin is not a substance or a co-eternal principle rivaling God. It is a moral **privation** of conformity to the law of God, a defect in an act of a rational creature that fails the rule of **original righteousness** and the end of the divine glory. Yet sin is not a mere nothing, as though culpability evaporates; it is a privation inhering in a positive act of a will, a bent action in which the agent withholds due order and pursues a disordered good. The origin of sin, in the biblical economy, is the first transgression of Adam, the public person, in a real **covenant of works**, by which the human race stood or fell in him. On that act, Adam’s guilt is imputed to his posterity and his corrupted nature is propagated to all by ordinary generation. The theological task is to explain this without making God the author of sin, defend the justice of **federal headship** and **immediate imputation**, and account for the universal sway of **concupiscence** while preserving the integrity of creaturely agency and the goodness of creation.

Augustine set the architecture of Western hamartiology by distinguishing sin’s moral privation from the goodness of created being, and by identifying the human race’s solidarity in Adam. Pressed by Pelagius, who insisted that moral inability undermines responsibility, Augustine answered that moral inability is voluntary in origin and inherited as habitus, not a metaphysical defect inflicted by God. Adam’s nature was good and mutable. His **original righteousness** was a rectitude of love, an ordered subordination of desires to reason enthralled by God. The fall was pride’s curving of love in upon self, a will’s refusal of the higher good for a lower. For Augustine, sin is non esse moris, a not-being of moral order that only arises in a positive act, and thus the act requires efficient causation while the defect does not. God is the cause of the act insofar as it has being, through **concursus** with secondary causes; God is not the cause of the defect qua defect because a defect is precisely the withholding of due rule. This metaphysical grammar guards divine goodness and places culpability squarely on the creaturely will. On origin, Augustine’s exegesis of Romans 5 argued that in Adam all sinned, not only by imitation but by participation, since the race was in him as its root and he stood as its head. He articulated both realism of natural solidarity and a juridical unity by which Adam’s person implicated his progeny. Thus guilt is not first earned by our acts but imputed from Adam’s act, and corruption follows as the habitual bias that makes sin inevitable though still voluntary. Augustine defended infant baptism because infants share both guilt and corruption before personal acts. He viewed **concupiscence** as sin in the regenerate as well as the unregenerate, because its very disorder violates the law of love, even if its reigning power is broken by grace. The Augustinian synthesis fixes three anchors: sin is a **privation** in an act, Adam’s transgression is the origin-point of race-wide culpability, and the bondage that follows is moral, not natural, so that responsibility remains.

Thomas Aquinas refined this Augustinian core by clarifying the relation of **original righteousness** and concupiscence. For Aquinas, God created man with a natural integrity of powers, but rectitude in the strict sense was a supernatural gift, the donum superadditum, ordering the lower powers to reason and reason to God. In losing this gift, the internal harmony fractured, so that concupiscence now disorders the passions and will. Original sin in Aquinas is the privation of that original justice, inhering in the soul as a habitus-disorder, and it is transmitted by generation because the whole nature is propagated in a state of destitution of its highest form. Aquinas thus explains how sin can be universal without imputing a physical stain or making God its cause: the propagation is of nature lacking a right relation, not of a positive evil substance. He holds with Augustine that sin is **lawlessness** and **privation**, but he locates the loss at the level of a forfeited rectitude that had united the powers. Aquinas also insists that God concurs with the being of every act while not causing the moral disorder, which is precisely a failure of order rather than a positive entity. The later Roman Catholic conclusion that **concupiscence** in the baptized is not strictly sin exploits Aquinas’s distinction, though it pushes beyond his own more Augustinian sensibility. This becomes a point of divergence with the Reformation, where concupiscence’s very disorder remains contrary to the law.

Martin Luther radicalized Augustine’s moral diagnosis at the level of subjectivity. Sin is the heart incurvatus in se, bent away from God in faithless desire. In Bondage of the Will he blows up the myth of an undetermined will, insisting that post-fall the will is enslaved to its loves and cannot choose God. Luther’s insistence that **concupiscence** is truly sin targets the idea that sinful desire is morally neutral until assented to. He maintains that the law judges not only outward acts but inward affections, so that the lingering disorder in the regenerate is sin requiring constant mortification. Yet Luther preserves, with the confessional tradition, that Adam before the fall possessed a true freedom ad utrumlibet within the boundaries of **original righteousness** under the **covenant of works**. The origin of sin lies in unbelief’s refusal of God’s word which breaks the order of trust. Luther’s polemical framing is indispensable as an antidote to semi-Pelagian evasions. It also sharpens the correlative doctrine of grace. However, Luther’s opponents press whether the depth of bondage compromises responsibility. Luther would respond that responsibility tracks the will’s love and intention, not a metaphysical power of contrary choice, a point later systematized by compatibilist accounts.

Francis Turretin supplies the Reformed scholastic precision on headship, imputation, and God’s non-authorship of sin. In Institutes of Elenctic Theology, he distinguishes the twofold of original sin, guilt and inherent corruption. He argues for **immediate imputation** of Adam’s guilt to his posterity by virtue of **federal headship**. Adam did not act merely as a private man but as a representative in a real probationary arrangement, the **covenant of works**. Hence the forensic relation is primary. The corruption of nature is propagated through generation and explains our inability and inclination to evil. Turretin rejects mediate imputation, which suspends guilt on the prior existence of corruption, as both biblically and conceptually confused. Romans 5 grounds condemnation in the one man’s act. He also wrestles with traducianism and creationism of souls. He allows for creationism if joined to **immediate imputation** so that the soul’s corruption is explained by its union to a corrupt nature and the withdrawal of original righteousness, not by a direct creation of moral defect by God. On divine concurrence, Turretin articulates the classical distinction of God’s decree and permission, efficient causality of the act qua act, and denial of efficient causality of the sin qua sin. God decrees and concurs with all that comes to pass according to his wise plan; the moral deficiency arises from the creaturely will’s failure of conformity. This principled asymmetry is not a sleight of hand but the outworking of **analogical knowledge** and the doctrine of **divine simplicity**. God’s will has no admixture of defect. Secondary causes can deviate; God’s willing is pure goodness.

Jonathan Edwards advances this architecture by providing a systematic account of freedom, moral necessity, and the constitution of the human race that undergirds original sin. In Freedom of the Will he dismantles the libertarian premise that responsibility requires a power of contrary choice. The will is as the greatest apparent good is. Voluntary acts are those that flow from the agent’s prevailing disposition. This is **compatibilism**: moral necessity is consistent with moral responsibility when the necessity is located in the agent’s disposition, not external compulsion. This grounds the Augustinian claim that inability can be culpable when it is an inability of heart-love. In Original Sin, Edwards defends the universality of sin by arguing that the facts of human history, infant death, and the biblical narrative point to a common ruin, not simply imitation. He articulates a federal-natural constitution: God constituted Adam and his posterity one moral person by covenant, so that his act is truly ours by divine appointment. This avoids crude realism yet grounds **immediate imputation** in an ontological-juridical union. Edwards answers the fairness objection: all human persons depend on divine appointment for their circumstances and relations; if we accept benefits through union with a head, it is not unjust to receive liabilities. Further, the gospel requires parallel logic in Christ, where his righteousness is imputed to those united to him by a new covenant headship. Edwards also treats the thorny question of the first sin’s emergence: how did a righteous will come to sin without prior sinful inclination. He posits the mutability of created holiness, the withholding of confirming grace under the **covenant of works**, and the presence of a finite appetite legitimately attracted to a lower good. The first sinful volition is not produced by an antecedent sinful nature but by a will that turns from God in a privative act, which then corrupts the nature. The event is comprehended in God’s decree without God’s causing its sinfulness. Edwards’s refined account allows one to say that pre-fall Adam had the natural liberty to choose differently, yet he did not, and his choice flowed from a mutable disposition that God permitted to fail for wise and just ends.

These five figures form a canonical line. Their proposals illuminate three layers of debate that a candidate must be prepared to face. Internally, Reformed theology has debated whether Adam’s guilt is imputed immediately or mediately through inherited corruption. Mediate imputation is often motivated by a desire to soften forensic offense, but it reverses Paul’s order and makes guilt a function of an already corrupt nature. The position defended here follows Turretin and Edwards: **immediate imputation** is biblically warranted and theologically necessary to preserve the forensic constitution of both covenants. Another internal debate concerns traducianism and creationism. Traducianists argue that the soul is propagated with the body, which explains corruption by inheritance without implicating God as author of moral evil. Creationists hold that God creates each soul, which then contracts corruption by union with a fallen nature and by the loss of **original righteousness** through imputation of Adam’s guilt. Either view can be held compatibly with confessional Reformed theology if joined to **federal headship** and denial that God directly creates moral defect. Regarding **concupiscence**, the Reformed affirm with Augustine and Luther that the disorder of desire is itself sin because it violates the law’s positive demand for perfect love. This diverges from the Roman Catholic claim that concupiscence in the baptized is not sin. Finally, some internal discussion surrounds the status of **original righteousness** as a superadded gift versus a created moral integrity. The Reformed resist the notion that Adam’s rectitude was merely extrinsic. It belongs to his created condition under the **covenant of works**, though always dependent on God. The label superadded need not be rejected if it simply marks the gratuitousness of the covenant, but it must not imply that man’s created nature did not include divine image with rectitude.

Externally, Pelagian and semi-Pelagian positions insist that moral responsibility requires unfallen power to obey, reject inherited guilt, and reduce original sin to bad examples or environmental influences. Augustine, Luther, and Edwards show why such schemes undercut grace and fail to explain the biblical universals of death and transgression. Eastern Orthodox theology often speaks of ancestral sin as mortality and corruption without imputing guilt. This preserves parts of the story but leaves the forensic dimension of Romans 5 and Ephesians 2 wanting. Roman Catholic theology after Trent affirms original sin, yet says **concupiscence** remains in the baptized without guilt per se. The Reformed reply that the moral law searches affections and that desires contrary to the law have the nature of sin, though they do not reign in the regenerate. Arminian accounts resist **immediate imputation** in favor of universal prevenient grace nullifying inherited guilt. Yet such positions struggle to account coherently for the universality and inevitability of sin and often weaken the analogy between Adam and Christ that grounds the gospel’s forensic core.

Contemporary debates test this doctrine anew. Evolutionary accounts pressure the historical Adam and the headship structure. If humanity descends from a population, can a single federal head meaningfully represent all? The defended position maintains the necessity of a historical Adam whose act is legally constitutive of the race under a real **covenant of works**. Federal representation does not require biological monogenesis in a narrow sense, but the biblical narrative and Pauline argument require that there be an original public person, the first man, whose act stands for his posterity. Claims that sin is merely an emergent evolutionary byproduct of survival strategies miss the moral nature of **lawlessness** and its God-relation. Structural accounts of sin are also prominent. Scripture knows powers and systems that entrench injustice, but these are parasitic on personal sin; they do not replace imputation and individual guilt. Psychological determinisms threaten responsibility from another angle, suggesting that trauma and neurochemistry dissolve guilt. A Reformed compatibilist response affirms real influences and diminished culpability in some cases without collapsing responsibility, since moral agency tracks the will’s love and intentionality relative to God’s law. Finally, analytic worries about God as author of sin arise from robust providence. The classical answer retrieves the metaphysics articulated from Augustine to Turretin. There is one decree and pervasive **concursus** such that God is the primary cause of all being and order. Sin is a **privation** within an act of a secondary cause. God’s decree wills to permit this defect for wiser goods, including the display of mercy and justice in Christ. Because of **divine simplicity**, there is no composition of will in God that could include a privative element. Author-of-sin charges rely on univocal causality and ignore the asymmetry in causing being and causing defect. The charge also fails to distinguish between a sufficient condition for a defect and the direct volition of defect as defect. The Reformed tradition denies the latter.

Two objections deserve extended answers. First, is **immediate imputation** unjust. Why should I bear guilt for Adam’s act. The reply is threefold. Covenantally, God justly ordains corporate persons whose actions bind those they represent. This appears across Scripture and human law. Ontologically, as Edwards argues, all human persons live by divine constitution that sets fundamental relations; justice evaluates fittingness within that order, not abstract autonomy. Redemptively, the gospel’s imputation of Christ’s righteousness presupposes Adamic imputation. To reject the latter is to undermine the former. Second, how can a good will sin in the first instance. Augustine answers with mutability and inordinate love; Aquinas with the loss of a rectitude dependent on God; Edwards with a mutable disposition permitted to fail. The decisive point is that the defect of the first sin has no efficient cause as defect. It is a meltdown of order in an agent capable of withholding right order. Once the fall transpires, corruption fixes a predisposition that explains the universality of sin without denying voluntariness.

The doctrine interlocks with adjacent loci. Providence and **concursus** shape the author-of-sin question. Anthropology clarifies the image of God, faculties, and the loss of **original righteousness**. Christology addresses the absence of original sin in Christ by the sanctifying work of the Spirit in the Incarnation and by the unique person of the Son, ensuring **impeccability**. Soteriology turns on the parity of the two Adams. Ecclesiology includes infant baptism as a public acknowledgement of inherited guilt and corruption. Ethics depends on recognizing that **concupiscence** is sin to be mortified, not a neutral impulse. Scripture is the norming norm, particularly Genesis 3, Romans 5, and Ephesians 2, which ground the account historically and forensically.

A final pastoral calibration. Calling **concupiscence** sin does not collapse all distinctions of culpability. The regenerate experience a real conflict in which sinful desires arise involuntarily. They are sin to be confessed yet, when not consented to, do not bring the same guilt as deliberate acts. Nor does **total depravity** mean utter depravity. It describes the pervasiveness of corruption across all faculties, not the absolute maximum of evil in every act. The natural image of reason, affections, and will remains, though marred, and is the instrument of grace’s renewal. The propagation of corruption does not render God the cause of sin but signals the deep solidarity of the race, the weight of Adam’s failure, and the necessity of a new Head. Under **federal headship**, God’s justice and goodness are displayed twice: first in condemning the race in Adam, and supremely in justifying a multitude in Christ by **immediate imputation** of his obedience. The first doctrine of sin thus presses us decisively into the second doctrine of grace.

The position defended, then, is Augustinian-Reformed. Sin is **privation** in an act of the will, a real culpable deviation from the law’s order and end. Its historical origin is Adam’s first transgression as covenant head under the **covenant of works**, by which his guilt is immediately imputed to his posterity and his corruption propagated through generation. **Concupiscence** is itself sin, though in the regenerate it does not reign. God decrees and concurs with all that is, permitting without causing the defect of sin, so that he is not its author. Human responsibility stands with **compatibilism**, since moral agency consists in acting from one’s prevailing loves. This framework withstands internal and external objections and remains resilient under contemporary pressures, because it is anchored in Scripture’s dual Adamic economy and in the metaphysical clarity of **privation**, **concursus**, and **federal headship**.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Sin** is a moral **privation** of conformity to God’s law occurring in a positive act of will; its origin for humanity is Adam’s first transgression under a **covenant of works**, yielding imputed guilt and propagated corruption.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: privation, race in Adam, guilt and corruption, concupiscence as sin.
  - Thomas Aquinas: **original righteousness** as donum, loss yields concupiscence, propagation without God causing defect.
  - Martin Luther: incurvatus in se, bondage of will, concupiscence truly sin.
  - Francis Turretin: **federal headship**, **immediate imputation**, **concursus** without authoring sin.
  - Jonathan Edwards: **compatibilism**, federal-natural constitution, defense of imputation and the first sin.
- Debates:
  - Internal: immediate vs mediate imputation; traducianism vs creationism; status of concupiscence; nature of original righteousness.

  - Contemporary: evolution and historical Adam; structural vs personal sin; psychological determinism; divine **concursus** and author-of-sin.
- Defended position: Augustinian-Reformed account with **federal headship**, **immediate imputation**, propagation of corruption, **concupiscence** as sin, under a permissive decree consistent with **divine simplicity** and **compatibilism**.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Why is immediate imputation just? Because covenantal representation is just and required to ground Christ’s imputed righteousness.
  - How is God not author of sin? Because sin’s defect has no efficient cause; God concurs with being and order, not with privation.
  - Is concupiscence sin in the regenerate? Yes, as disorder against the law, though it does not reign.
  - How did the first sin arise from a good will? By mutable rectitude withholding due order under divine permission, not by a prior sinful nature.
  - Can creationism of souls avoid making God create corruption? Yes, if joined to **immediate imputation** and the loss of **original righteousness** through union with Adam.
