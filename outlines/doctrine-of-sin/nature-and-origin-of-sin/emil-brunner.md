# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **nature and origin of sin** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the existential disruption of the **God-human relationship**. He rejected both a purely **Augustinian doctrine of original sin** and a liberal minimization of sin, instead describing sin as a relational rupture and an act of **human autonomy** against God’s will. Brunner saw sin as both universal and personal, rooted in the misuse of human freedom.

- "Sin is not a substance, but a relation, a relation of the creature to the Creator which has become false." ("Man in Revolt")

## Key Works

- "Man in Revolt" (Der Mensch im Widerspruch, 1937)
- "The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption" (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- "The Mediator" (1934)
- "The Divine-Human Encounter" (1943)
- "Revelation and Reason" (1946)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Relational Rupture**
    - Sin is fundamentally a broken relationship between humanity and God.
    - It is not a metaphysical substance or inherited essence.
    - The essence of sin is the refusal of creaturely dependence.
    - Sin is existential, affecting the whole person in their orientation toward God.
    - "Sin is the self-contradiction of man, the contradiction between what he is and what he ought to be." ("Man in Revolt")

2. **Rejection of Classical Original Sin**
    - Brunner critiques the traditional Augustinian view of inherited guilt.
    - He emphasizes personal responsibility and existential participation in sin.
    - Sin’s universality is explained by the solidarity of the human race, not biological transmission.
    - He maintains that every person reenacts Adam’s rebellion.
    - "We are not sinners because Adam sinned, but because we ourselves repeat Adam’s sin." ("Man in Revolt")

3. **Sin as Autonomy and Pride**
    - The root of sin is the human claim to autonomy from God.
    - Sin manifests as pride and the desire to be like God.
    - This autonomy leads to alienation from both God and neighbor.
    - Sin is the misuse of the freedom given by God.
    - "The essence of sin is man’s claim to be his own master." ("Man in Revolt")

4. **Universality and Inevitability of Sin**
    - All humans inevitably fall into sin due to the existential condition of humanity.
    - Sin is universal, but not a necessary part of human nature as created.
    - The universality of sin is a mystery, not a logical necessity.
    - Brunner avoids deterministic explanations, preserving human responsibility.
    - "The universality of sin is a fact, but its necessity is not a logical one." ("Man in Revolt")

5. **Sin and Revelation**
    - True knowledge of sin comes only through **divine revelation**.
    - Human reason cannot fully grasp the depth of sin’s reality.
    - The **Word of God** exposes the true nature of human rebellion.
    - Sin is revealed in the light of Christ’s person and work.
    - "Only in the light of revelation do we recognize the true depth of our sin." ("The Mediator")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s account of the **nature and origin of sin** shaped twentieth-century Protestant theology by emphasizing the relational and existential dimensions of sin over metaphysical or deterministic accounts. His critique of **original sin** and focus on human autonomy influenced later discussions in both Reformed and ecumenical circles. Brunner’s work remains a significant reference point for debates on **human freedom**, responsibility, and the theological anthropology of sin.
