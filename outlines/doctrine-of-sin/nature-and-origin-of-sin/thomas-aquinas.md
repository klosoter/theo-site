# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a nuanced understanding of the **nature and origin of sin**, emphasizing its privative character and its roots in the disordered will. For Aquinas, **sin** is fundamentally a turning away from the **divine law** and a failure to order human actions toward their **ultimate end** in God. He maintained that **original sin** is transmitted by propagation, not imitation, and that all actual sins flow from this inherited corruption.

- "Sin is nothing else than a morally bad act." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.71, a.6)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I-II, Questions 71–89)
- Summa Contra Gentiles (Book III, chs. 122–133)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard (Book II, Distinctions 30–42)
- De Malo (On Evil)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Privation of Good**
    - Sin is not a substance but a privation of due order in the will.
    - Evil, including moral evil, lacks ontological substance and is parasitic on the good.
    - Sin arises when the will turns away from the proper end, which is God.
    - The act itself is good in its being, but evil in its moral disorder.
    - "Sin, properly speaking, denotes a bad human act, which is an act lacking its due order." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.71, a.6)

2. **Origin of Sin in Free Will**
    - The immediate cause of sin is the misuse of **free will**.
    - The will chooses a lesser good over the highest good, God.
    - Intellect presents an apparent good, but the will is responsible for the disordered choice.
    - No external force compels the will to sin; it is self-determined.
    - "The cause of sin is in the free-will, as regards its act of turning away from God." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.75, a.1)

3. **Original Sin as Habitual Disorder**
    - **Original sin** is a habitual corruption inherited from Adam.
    - It is not an act but a deprivation of original righteousness.
    - All humans, except Christ, contract original sin by propagation.
    - The transmission is by human generation, not by imitation.
    - "Original sin is transmitted by way of origin, not by way of imitation." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.81, a.1)

4. **Distinction Between Mortal and Venial Sin**
    - **Mortal sin** destroys charity and severs the soul from God.
    - **Venial sin** wounds but does not break the relationship with God.
    - The gravity of sin depends on the object and the agent’s knowledge and consent.
    - Mortal sin merits eternal punishment; venial sin merits temporal punishment.
    - "Mortal sin is so called because it destroys the spiritual life which is the effect of charity." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.88, a.1)

5. **Role of Law and Reason in Defining Sin**
    - Sin is defined as a violation of **eternal law** and **natural law**.
    - Right reason, reflecting divine law, is the proximate rule of human acts.
    - Sin occurs when an act is contrary to reason and thus to God’s law.
    - Law provides the objective standard by which acts are judged sinful.
    - "Every sin is a disordered act, being contrary to reason and to the eternal law." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.93, a.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s account of the **nature and origin of sin** profoundly shaped both Roman Catholic and broader Christian theology, especially in articulating the privative nature of evil and the centrality of **free will**. His distinctions between **original sin**, mortal and venial sin, and the role of law in moral evaluation remain foundational in Catholic moral theology. Later theologians, including the Reformers, engaged deeply with his categories, either adopting or critically revising them. Aquinas’s synthesis continues to influence contemporary discussions on the metaphysics of evil and the anthropology of sin.
