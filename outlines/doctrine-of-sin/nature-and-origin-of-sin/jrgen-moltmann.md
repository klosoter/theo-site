# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets the **nature and origin of sin** through the lens of **eschatology**, **theodicy**, and the **relational nature of God**. He emphasizes that sin is not merely an individual moral failure but a disruption of **community** and **creation**, rooted in alienation from God and others. Moltmann situates sin within the broader context of **suffering**, **history**, and the hope for **redemption**.

- "Sin is not only guilt, but also the power of destruction and self-destruction in human life." ("The Crucified God")

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- God in Creation (1985)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God (1995)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Alienation from God and Others**
   - Sin is fundamentally a rupture in relationship, not just a legal transgression.
   - Alienation manifests in brokenness between humanity, God, and creation.
   - This alienation leads to both personal and communal suffering.
   - Sin’s origin is tied to humanity’s rejection of God’s relational intent.
   - "Sin is the experience of separation from God, from other men, and from oneself." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Sin in the Context of Suffering and Theodicy**
   - Moltmann connects sin to the reality of suffering and evil in the world.
   - He rejects the idea that suffering is always a direct result of personal sin.
   - The cross reveals God’s solidarity with those suffering under the power of sin.
   - Sin is both a cause and a consequence of historical and social evil.
   - "God suffers with those who suffer under sin and evil." (The Crucified God)

3. **Sin as Structural and Social, Not Merely Individual**
   - Sin is embedded in social structures and systems, not just individual acts.
   - Oppression, injustice, and violence are manifestations of collective sin.
   - Redemption must address both personal and societal dimensions of sin.
   - The church is called to confront systemic evil as part of its mission.
   - "The sin of the world is not only the sum of individual sins, but the structure of evil in history." (God in Creation)

4. **Eschatological Perspective on Sin and Redemption**
   - Sin is understood in light of God’s promised future and the coming kingdom.
   - The resurrection points to the ultimate defeat of sin and death.
   - Hope in God’s future empowers resistance against the present power of sin.
   - Eschatology reframes the origin and end of sin within God’s redemptive plan.
   - "Only in the light of hope can the full depth of sin be recognized." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Creation, Freedom, and the Possibility of Sin**
   - God creates humanity with genuine freedom, making sin possible but not necessary.
   - The risk of sin is inherent in the gift of freedom and relational love.
   - Creation’s goodness is marred, but not destroyed, by the reality of sin.
   - The Spirit’s work is to renew creation and restore freedom from sin’s bondage.
   - "Freedom is the presupposition of sin, but also of love and redemption." (God in Creation)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **sin**, especially by integrating the themes of **suffering**, **community**, and **eschatological hope**. His emphasis on the relational and structural dimensions of sin has influenced liberation, political, and ecological theologies. By situating the origin and nature of sin within the broader narrative of redemption, Moltmann offers a vision of hope that challenges both individualistic and deterministic accounts of evil. His work continues to inspire theologians to address sin as a reality that is both personal and cosmic, always in view of God’s promised future.
