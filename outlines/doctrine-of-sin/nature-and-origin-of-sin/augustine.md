# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **nature and origin of sin** is foundational for Western theology. He taught that **sin** is not a substance but a **privation of good**, originating from the **disordered will** of rational creatures, most notably in the **original sin** of Adam, which is transmitted to all humanity. Augustine’s account emphasizes the necessity of **divine grace** for liberation from the bondage of sin.

- "For when the will abandons what is above itself, and turns to what is lower, it becomes evil—not because that is evil to which it turns, but because the turning itself is wicked." (Confessions, Book VII)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- On the Free Choice of the Will (De Libero Arbitrio)
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- On Nature and Grace (De Natura et Gratia)
- On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins (De Peccatorum Meritis et Remissione)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Privation of Good**
    - Sin is not a created substance but a lack or corruption of the good that ought to be present.
    - Evil has no independent existence; it is parasitic on the good.
    - God is not the author of sin, since all He creates is good.
    - The will’s turning away from God is the source of moral evil.
    - "Evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'" (City of God, XI.9)

2. **Original Sin and Its Transmission**
    - All humanity participated in Adam’s first sin, resulting in universal guilt and corruption.
    - Original sin is transmitted by natural generation, not merely imitation.
    - Human nature is radically corrupted and unable to will the good apart from grace.
    - Baptism is necessary to cleanse the guilt of original sin.
    - "In Adam, all die; and in Christ, all shall be made alive." (On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, I.9)

3. **Bondage of the Will**
    - After the Fall, the human will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose the good unaided.
    - True freedom is the ability to love and serve God, which is lost through sin.
    - Only divine grace can liberate the will from its bondage.
    - Pelagian claims of unaided human ability are rejected as heretical.
    - "Without God’s help, man cannot turn from sin to righteousness." (On the Spirit and the Letter, 3)

4. **Divine Justice and Human Responsibility**
    - God’s justice is upheld even as He permits the fall and its consequences.
    - Humans are morally responsible for their sinful choices, despite inherited corruption.
    - The mystery of predestination does not negate accountability.
    - Divine grace does not coerce but heals and restores the will.
    - "God created us without us: but He did not will to save us without us." (Sermon 169)

5. **Necessity of Grace for Overcoming Sin**
    - Grace is absolutely necessary for the healing of the will and the forgiveness of sins.
    - Prevenient grace enables the first movement toward God.
    - Justification and sanctification are works of God’s free mercy.
    - The sacraments, especially baptism, are means of grace against sin.
    - "It is by God’s grace that the will is prepared for the reception of grace." (On Grace and Free Will, 32)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s doctrine of **original sin** and his understanding of the will’s bondage shaped the Western tradition, profoundly influencing both Roman Catholic and Reformation theology. His polemics against Pelagianism established the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation and the radical depth of human sinfulness. Later theologians, including Aquinas and the Reformers, developed their own positions in dialogue with Augustine’s insights on the nature and origin of sin. His thought remains a touchstone for debates on human nature, freedom, and redemption.
