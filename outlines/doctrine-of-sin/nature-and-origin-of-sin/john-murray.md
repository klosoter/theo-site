# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a robust and nuanced account of the **nature and origin of sin**, emphasizing its reality as a violation of **God’s law**, its transmission through **Adam’s federal headship**, and its pervasive corruption of human nature. He upheld the **Reformed doctrine of original sin**, stressing both the imputation of Adam’s guilt and the inherited depravity affecting all humanity, while carefully distinguishing between **guilt** and **corruption**.

- "Sin is essentially lawlessness, and lawlessness is the contradiction of the will of God." ("The Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

## Key Works

- "The Imputation of Adam’s Sin" (1959)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray," Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "Romans" (NICNT Commentary, esp. on Romans 5:12–21)
- "Principles of Conduct" (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Lawlessness**
   - Sin is fundamentally the transgression of the **moral law of God**.
   - It is not merely a privation but an active opposition to God’s revealed will.
   - Murray rejects any reduction of sin to mere imperfection or finitude.
   - The ethical character of sin is central to its definition.
   - "Sin is not simply a defect; it is positive and purposeful opposition to God." ("Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

2. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
   - Adam acted as the **federal representative** for all humanity.
   - Adam’s first sin is judicially imputed to his descendants.
   - This imputation establishes the legal ground for the universality of sin.
   - The solidarity of the human race in Adam is both covenantal and forensic.
   - "The sin of Adam is the judicial ground of the condemnation of all." ("Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

3. **Original Sin: Guilt and Corruption**
   - Original sin includes both **imputed guilt** and **inherited corruption**.
   - All humans are born under condemnation and with a depraved nature.
   - Murray distinguishes but never separates guilt and corruption.
   - The propagation of sin is both judicial and existential.
   - "Original sin consists in the loss of original righteousness and the corruption of the whole nature." ("Collected Writings," Vol. 2)

4. **Total Depravity**
   - The corruption from original sin extends to every aspect of human nature.
   - No part of human faculties remains untouched by sin.
   - Total depravity does not mean utter depravity, but pervasive corruption.
   - Human inability is both moral and spiritual, not metaphysical.
   - "There is no area of the human personality that is not affected by sin." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

5. **Rejection of Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian Views**
   - Murray firmly opposes any denial of the transmission of Adam’s sin.
   - He critiques views that see sin as merely imitation or environmental.
   - The necessity of **divine grace** is absolute due to the depth of human depravity.
   - Human will is in bondage and cannot initiate its own recovery.
   - "The doctrine of original sin is the only adequate explanation of the universal need for redemption." ("Principles of Conduct")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of **original sin** and its transmission remains influential in Reformed theology, especially for its careful exegesis and doctrinal precision. His defense of **federal headship** and the dual aspects of guilt and corruption shaped subsequent discussions on the doctrine of sin. Murray’s work continues to be a standard reference for those seeking a biblically grounded and confessionally robust account of the **nature and origin of sin**.
