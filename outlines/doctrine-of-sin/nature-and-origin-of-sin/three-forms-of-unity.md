# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust doctrine of the **nature and origin of sin** within the framework of **Reformed orthodoxy**. Sin is defined as a **corruption of human nature** inherited from Adam through the **Fall**, resulting in **total depravity** and the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation. These confessions emphasize both the **imputation of Adam’s guilt** and the ongoing presence of **original sin** in all humanity.

- "We believe that by the disobedience of Adam original sin has been spread through the whole human race." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Articles 14–15
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Days 2–4 (Questions 3–8)
- Canons of Dort, Third and Fourth Main Points of Doctrine, Articles 1–4
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (compiled editions)
- Lyle D. Bierma, *An Introduction to the Heidelberg Catechism* (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin Originates in Adam’s Fall**
    - Humanity was created good but fell through Adam’s willful disobedience.
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** of the human race, so his guilt and corruption are imputed to all.
    - The Fall resulted in the loss of original righteousness and the entrance of sin into human nature.
    - Sin is not merely imitation but a real transmission from Adam to his descendants.
    - "Therefore we reject the error of the Pelagians who say that this sin is only a matter of imitation." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.2)

2. **Total Depravity of Human Nature**
    - After the Fall, every aspect of human nature is corrupted by sin.
    - Humans are incapable of doing any spiritual good apart from grace.
    - The will is enslaved to sin and cannot turn to God on its own.
    - This depravity is universal and affects all people without exception.
    - "We are so corrupt that we are totally unable to do any good and inclined toward all evil." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q/A 8)

3. **Original Sin and Its Transmission**
    - Original sin is both the guilt and corruption inherited from Adam.
    - It is present from conception and affects the whole person.
    - This inherited sin makes all people liable to God’s judgment.
    - The confessions distinguish between original and actual sins but see both as stemming from the same root.
    - "Original sin is a corruption of the whole nature and an inherited depravity." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

4. **Sin as Lawlessness and Rebellion**
    - Sin is defined as any lack of conformity to or transgression of God’s law.
    - It includes both inward corruption and outward acts.
    - The confessions stress the seriousness of sin as rebellion against God’s majesty.
    - Even the smallest sins are worthy of eternal punishment.
    - "God’s justice requires that sin committed against the most high majesty of God be punished with everlasting punishment." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q/A 11)

5. **Necessity of Divine Grace for Deliverance**
    - Human beings cannot free themselves from sin by their own efforts.
    - Only the regenerating work of the **Holy Spirit** can overcome the bondage of sin.
    - Grace is necessary for both the forgiveness of guilt and the renewal of nature.
    - The confessions reject all forms of synergism or human merit in salvation.
    - "Unless we are regenerated by the Spirit of God, we are incapable of any saving good." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped the **Reformed doctrine of sin**, establishing a confessional standard for churches in the Dutch and continental Reformed tradition. Their clear articulation of **original sin**, **total depravity**, and the need for **sovereign grace** continues to inform theological education, preaching, and pastoral care. These documents remain foundational for understanding the human condition and the necessity of redemption in classic Reformed theology.
