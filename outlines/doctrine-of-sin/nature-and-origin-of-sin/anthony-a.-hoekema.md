# Anthony Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony Hoekema approached the **nature and origin of sin** from a distinctly **Reformed** and **biblical-theological** perspective, emphasizing the seriousness of **original sin** and its pervasive effects on human nature. He maintained that sin is not merely an act but a **corruption of the whole person**, rooted in the historical fall of Adam, and propagated to all humanity. Hoekema insisted on the reality of **total depravity** while upholding human responsibility.

- "Sin is not something accidental or superficial, but something that has penetrated to the very core of man's being." ("Created in God's Image")

## Key Works

- Created in God's Image (1986)
- The Four Major Cults (1963) [for contrasts with orthodox doctrine]
- Saved by Grace (1989)
- The Bible and the Future (1979) [for eschatological implications of sin]
- "The Reformed Doctrine of Total Depravity" (various articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as a Corruption of Human Nature**
   - Sin is not merely external behavior but a deep-seated corruption affecting every aspect of the person.
   - The **image of God** in humanity is marred but not destroyed by sin.
   - Sin involves both **guilt** and **pollution**.
   - The whole person—mind, will, emotions—is affected by the fall.
   - "Sin is a spiritual disease which has infected every part of man's being." (Created in God's Image)

2. **Historical Fall and Original Sin**
   - The origin of sin is traced to the historical Adam and Eve in the Garden.
   - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity, so his sin is imputed to all.
   - Original sin includes both the guilt of Adam's first sin and the corruption inherited by all.
   - Hoekema rejects any notion of sin as a mere myth or symbol.
   - "The doctrine of original sin teaches that we are sinners not only because we sin, but that we sin because we are sinners." (Created in God's Image)

3. **Total Depravity and Human Responsibility**
   - Total depravity means every part of human nature is affected by sin, not that humans are as bad as possible.
   - Despite depravity, humans retain **responsibility** and are accountable before God.
   - The will is bound by sin but not annihilated.
   - Hoekema opposes both Pelagianism and deterministic fatalism.
   - "Man is totally depraved, but he is still man, still responsible, still addressed by God." (Created in God's Image)

4. **Sin as Rebellion Against God**
   - Sin is fundamentally **rebellion** and **alienation** from God.
   - It is a violation of the created order and the law of God.
   - Sin distorts relationships—with God, self, others, and creation.
   - The essence of sin is self-centeredness and autonomy from God.
   - "Sin, at its heart, is the desire to be independent of God." (Created in God's Image)

5. **The Ongoing Effects and Defeat of Sin**
   - Sin's effects are ongoing in the world and in believers, even after regeneration.
   - Sanctification involves a lifelong struggle against the remnants of sin.
   - The final defeat of sin awaits the **eschatological** renewal of creation.
   - The work of Christ provides both the basis for forgiveness and the power for transformation.
   - "The Christian life is a constant battle against sin, but victory is assured in Christ." (Saved by Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of **original sin** and its consequences has shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology, especially in discussions of the **image of God** and human responsibility. His clear, biblically grounded approach has influenced evangelical theology and provided a robust defense against both liberal and Pelagian tendencies. Hoekema’s work remains a standard reference for understanding the depth and seriousness of sin within a Reformed framework.
