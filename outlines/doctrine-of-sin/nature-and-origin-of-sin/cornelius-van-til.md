# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **nature and origin of sin** from a consistently **Reformed** and **presuppositional** standpoint, emphasizing the **Creator-creature distinction** and the **covenantal context** of human existence. He argued that sin is fundamentally **ethical rebellion** against God, rooted in the creature’s attempt to assert autonomy, and that its origin must be understood within the **sovereign decree** of God without making God the author of sin.

- "Sin is ethical, not metaphysical; it is rebellion, not limitation." ("The Defense of the Faith")

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith (especially chapters on the fall and human nature)
- Christian Theistic Ethics
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- A Survey of Christian Epistemology
- Common Grace and the Gospel

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - Sin arises when the creature denies its dependence on the Creator.
    - The distinction is absolute; any blurring leads to idolatry and rebellion.
    - The origin of sin is not a metaphysical flaw but an ethical revolt.
    - Human autonomy is the essence of the sinful impulse.
    - "The essence of sin consists in man’s effort to efface the Creator-creature distinction." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenantal Context of Sin**
    - Sin must be understood within the framework of the covenant relationship.
    - Adam’s fall was a breach of the covenant of works.
    - The covenant provides the context for both obedience and rebellion.
    - The consequences of sin are both individual and corporate due to federal headship.
    - "The covenantal relationship is the presupposition of both the possibility and actuality of sin." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

3. **Sovereignty of God and the Decree**
    - God’s sovereign decree encompasses even the fall, without making Him the author of sin.
    - The origin of sin is ultimately mysterious but under divine providence.
    - Human responsibility is maintained alongside divine sovereignty.
    - The decree establishes the certainty, not the necessity, of sin.
    - "God foreordains whatsoever comes to pass, yet so as not to be the author of sin." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Ethical, Not Metaphysical, Nature of Sin**
    - Sin is not a defect in being but a willful ethical act.
    - The problem is not finitude but rebellion against God’s law.
    - The origin of sin is not to be sought in creaturely limitation.
    - Sin is a moral, not an ontological, problem.
    - "Sin is not a metaphysical limitation but an ethical revolt." (A Survey of Christian Epistemology)

5. **Antithesis and Noetic Effects**
    - Sin introduces an antithesis between believer and unbeliever.
    - The noetic effects of sin distort human reasoning and understanding.
    - The origin of sinful thought is the heart’s rebellion, not intellectual error alone.
    - Only regeneration can overcome the effects of sin on the mind.
    - "The antithesis is rooted in the ethical rebellion of man against God." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **nature and origin of sin** has profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and theology, especially through his emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the ethical character of sin. His presuppositional approach has influenced generations of theologians and apologists, reinforcing the necessity of grounding all discussion of sin in the context of God’s sovereignty and covenant. Van Til’s legacy endures in debates over the relationship between divine sovereignty, human responsibility, and the epistemological consequences of the fall.
