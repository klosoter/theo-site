# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen articulated a robust doctrine of the **nature and origin of sin** grounded in **Reformed anthropology** and **federal theology**. He emphasized the corruption of **original sin** inherited from Adam, the bondage of the human will, and the pervasive effects of **total depravity** on all faculties of the soul.

- "Sin aims always at the utmost; every time it rises up to tempt or entice, might it have its own course, it would go out to the utmost sin in that kind." ("Indwelling Sin in Believers")

## Key Works

- "The Nature, Power, Deceit, and Prevalency of the Remainders of Indwelling Sin in Believers"
- "A Display of Arminianism"
- "The Doctrine of the Saints’ Perseverance Explained and Confirmed"
- "The Works of John Owen," Vol. 6: "Temptation and Sin"
- "A Brief Declaration and Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity" (for anthropological context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin Originates in Adamic Covenant Breaking**
    - Humanity's fall is rooted in Adam's federal headship.
    - All humans inherit **original guilt** and corruption from Adam.
    - The imputation of Adam’s sin is both legal and real.
    - Sin’s entrance is a judicial consequence of covenant violation.
    - "We fell in Adam, and in him lost all original righteousness, and became wholly corrupt." ("Indwelling Sin in Believers")

2. **Total Depravity of Human Nature**
    - Every aspect of human nature is corrupted by sin.
    - The mind, will, and affections are all affected.
    - There is no spiritual good in fallen man apart from grace.
    - Sin is not merely a series of acts but a condition of the soul.
    - "The mind is darkened, the affections polluted, the will perverted." ("Indwelling Sin in Believers")

3. **Indwelling Sin Remains in Believers**
    - Regeneration does not eradicate the presence of sin.
    - Believers experience ongoing conflict with indwelling corruption.
    - The **mortification of sin** is a continual necessity.
    - Sin’s power is weakened but not destroyed in this life.
    - "Though its dominion be broken, its life is not extinguished." ("Indwelling Sin in Believers")

4. **Sin as Law and Principle**
    - Sin operates as an internal law contrary to God’s law.
    - It exerts a constant influence, inclining the soul toward evil.
    - The metaphor of “law” highlights sin’s power and persistence.
    - Deliverance requires the work of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - "Sin is a law in the members, rebelling against the law of the mind." ("Indwelling Sin in Believers")

5. **Necessity of Divine Grace for Deliverance**
    - Human effort alone cannot overcome sin’s power.
    - The **Holy Spirit** alone can mortify sin and renew the heart.
    - Grace is both prevenient and sustaining in sanctification.
    - The believer’s hope is in Christ’s victory over sin.
    - "Mortification from a self-strength, carried on by ways of self-invention, unto the end of a self-righteousness, is the soul and substance of all false religion in the world." ("Mortification of Sin")

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s doctrine of the **nature and origin of sin** profoundly shaped later **Reformed theology**, especially in its emphasis on the depth of human depravity and the necessity of sovereign grace. His careful distinctions regarding **indwelling sin** and the ongoing struggle in the Christian life became foundational for Puritan spirituality and pastoral practice. Owen’s insights continue to influence contemporary discussions on sin, sanctification, and the anthropology of the fallen human condition.
