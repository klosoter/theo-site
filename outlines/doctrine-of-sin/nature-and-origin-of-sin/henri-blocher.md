# Henri Blocher (1937–)

Henri Blocher offers a nuanced account of the **nature and origin of sin**, emphasizing the historical reality of the **Fall** and the mysterious character of **original sin**. He upholds the **Augustinian** tradition while engaging critically with **modern biblical scholarship**, insisting on the theological necessity of a real **Adam** and a non-mythical **Genesis 3**. Blocher’s approach is marked by careful exegesis and a willingness to acknowledge the **enigma** at the heart of evil’s entry into creation.

- "The origin of evil is the supreme enigma, the mystery of mysteries." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

## Key Works

- "Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle" (1997)
- "In the Beginning: The Opening Chapters of Genesis" (1984)
- "Evil and the Cross: An Analytical Look at the Problem of Pain" (1994)
- "The Faith of the Christian Church" (1984, French orig. 1976)
- "Sin" in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson et al.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Adam and the Fall**
    - Affirms the necessity of a real, historical Adam for a coherent doctrine of **original sin**.
    - Argues that **Genesis 3** is not myth but a unique, foundational narrative.
    - Maintains that the Fall is a real event with cosmic and anthropological consequences.
    - Sees the denial of Adam’s historicity as undermining the **gospel** and **redemption**.
    - "If Adam is only a myth, the doctrine of original sin collapses." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

2. **Sin as Enigma and Mystery**
    - Stresses that the **origin of sin** is ultimately inexplicable—evil has no positive ontological ground.
    - Rejects attempts to rationalize or explain evil’s emergence from a good creation.
    - Upholds the **Augustinian** insight that evil is a privation, not a substance.
    - Warns against speculative theodicies that diminish the radical mystery of sin.
    - "We must recognize the irrationality of sin, its character as a riddle." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

3. **Transmission of Original Sin**
    - Argues for a real transmission of **original sin** from Adam to all humanity.
    - Rejects both strict traducianism and Pelagian individualism.
    - Proposes a “realist” understanding: solidarity in Adam as the representative head.
    - Emphasizes the universality and inevitability of sin after the Fall.
    - "We are all implicated in Adam’s sin, not by imitation but by participation." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

4. **Sin’s Relationship to Human Freedom**
    - Maintains that Adam’s first sin was a genuinely free act, not necessitated by nature.
    - After the Fall, human will is enslaved to sin, yet responsibility remains.
    - Distinguishes between **prelapsarian** and **postlapsarian** freedom.
    - Insists that the mystery of sin does not absolve human culpability.
    - "The freedom of Adam was real, and so is the bondage that followed." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

5. **Biblical-Theological Method**
    - Employs careful exegesis of both Old and New Testament texts on sin.
    - Engages with **systematic theology** and historical confessions.
    - Integrates insights from philosophy and contemporary science, while remaining confessionally orthodox.
    - Seeks to let the **biblical narrative** shape doctrinal formulations.
    - "We must listen to the whole of Scripture to illumine the darkness of sin’s origin." ("Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle")

## Legacy and Impact

Blocher’s work on the **nature and origin of sin** has shaped contemporary evangelical and Reformed discussions, especially regarding the **historicity of Adam** and the theological reading of Genesis. His insistence on the **mystery of evil** has encouraged humility in theological reflection and cautioned against reductionist explanations. Blocher’s synthesis of exegetical rigor and doctrinal fidelity continues to influence debates on **original sin** and the doctrine of humanity.
