# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **nature and origin of sin** through the lens of **existentialist interpretation** and **demythologization**. He understood sin not as a metaphysical inheritance but as the existential condition of **alienation from God**, rooted in human autonomy and self-assertion. For Bultmann, the biblical narrative of the **Fall** is a mythological expression of the universal human tendency to ground one's existence apart from God.

- "Sin is not a substance handed down from Adam, but the existential possibility of every man." ("Theology of the New Testament")

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann" (1960)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Existential Estrangement**
    - Sin is fundamentally **alienation from God**, not a biological or metaphysical transmission.
    - It is the existential reality of living "in the flesh," apart from authentic faith.
    - The biblical account of Adam is a mythological depiction of every person's situation.
    - Sin is the self's attempt to secure life on its own terms, rejecting divine authority.
    - "Adam is every man; his story is the story of all." ("Theology of the New Testament")

2. **Demythologization of the Fall**
    - The Genesis narrative is not literal history but myth expressing existential truth.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind biblical symbols.
    - The "Fall" describes the universal human condition, not a historical event.
    - Sin's origin is thus reinterpreted as the ever-present possibility of human existence.
    - "The mythological event of the Fall is a representation of the existential situation of man." ("New Testament and Mythology")

3. **Sin as Unbelief**
    - Sin is defined as **unbelief**—the refusal to trust in God's word and grace.
    - Unbelief manifests as self-reliance and autonomy from God.
    - The New Testament's language of sin is existential, not ontological.
    - Faith is the only true response to the human condition of sin.
    - "Sin is the turning away from God to the visible, to the world, to oneself." ("Theology of the New Testament")

4. **Rejection of Original Sin as Inherited Guilt**
    - Bultmann denies the traditional doctrine of **original sin** as inherited guilt or corruption.
    - Each person is responsible for his or her own sin, not Adam's.
    - The universality of sin is existential, not genealogical.
    - The doctrine of inherited sin is a mythological way of expressing the pervasiveness of human estrangement.
    - "The idea of inherited sin is a mythological expression for the fact that all men sin." ("Theology of the New Testament")

5. **Sin and Authentic Existence**
    - Authentic existence is possible only through **faith** and openness to God's revelation.
    - Sin is the inauthentic mode of existence, characterized by anxiety and self-centeredness.
    - The call of the gospel is to move from inauthentic to authentic existence.
    - The existential decision for or against God is at the heart of the human condition.
    - "Faith is the possibility of existence in which man is freed from himself." ("Existence and Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's existential interpretation of the **nature and origin of sin** profoundly shaped twentieth-century **New Testament theology** and the dialogue between theology and philosophy. His method of **demythologization** remains influential, especially in discussions of biblical anthropology and the relevance of Christian doctrine in the modern world. While controversial for his rejection of traditional doctrines such as **original sin**, Bultmann's work continues to provoke critical engagement with the existential dimensions of sin and human existence before God.
