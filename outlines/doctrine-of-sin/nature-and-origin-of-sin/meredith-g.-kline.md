# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the **nature and origin of sin** through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the **federal headship of Adam** and the **covenantal structure** of God’s relationship with humanity. He argued that sin originated in the historical **fall** of Adam, whose disobedience constituted a breach of the **Covenant of Works** and brought **corporate guilt** and corruption upon all his descendants. Kline’s distinctive focus on the **kingdom-prologue** and the **legal-judicial framework** of Scripture shaped his understanding of sin’s entry into the world.

- "The entrance of sin into the world is to be understood in terms of the breaking of the covenantal order established by God at creation." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Images of the Spirit
- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- Treaty of the Great King: The Covenant Structure of Deuteronomy

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Covenant Violation**
    - Sin is fundamentally the violation of the **Covenant of Works** established with Adam.
    - Adam’s disobedience was not merely personal but a legal breach affecting all humanity.
    - The covenantal context frames sin as rebellion against God’s sovereign lordship.
    - The judicial consequences of sin are rooted in the terms of the original covenant.
    - "Sin is the transgression of the stipulations of the divine covenant." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam acted as the **federal representative** for all his descendants.
    - The guilt and corruption resulting from Adam’s sin are imputed to the human race.
    - This imputation is legal and covenantal, not merely biological or existential.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is foundational for understanding redemption.
    - "The federal principle is essential to the biblical doctrine of the origin and propagation of sin." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Historical Fall and Original Sin**
    - The origin of sin is located in a real, historical event: Adam’s fall.
    - Original sin is both guilt and corruption inherited from Adam.
    - The narrative of Genesis is interpreted as a covenant lawsuit documenting humanity’s fall.
    - Sin’s universality is explained by the solidarity of the human race in Adam.
    - "The fall is a historical, covenantal catastrophe with universal consequences." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Judicial and Eschatological Dimensions**
    - Sin introduces judicial liability and eschatological curse into creation.
    - The curse motif is central: sin brings exile from God’s presence and forfeiture of blessing.
    - The legal-judicial framework governs both the penalty and hope for restoration.
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in God’s promise to overcome sin’s effects.
    - "The curse pronounced in the covenant lawsuit is the judicial response to sin." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Context**
    - The origin and nature of sin are understood within the broader typological structure of Scripture.
    - Adam’s failure prefigures Israel’s covenant breaking and the need for a new Adam.
    - Sin’s story is inseparable from the unfolding of redemptive history.
    - The typological method highlights the unity of the biblical witness to sin and salvation.
    - "The typological structure of Scripture reveals the recurring pattern of covenant breaking and divine judgment." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and **federal theology** has significantly shaped Reformed discussions of the **nature and origin of sin**, especially in relation to the legal and judicial aspects of the fall. His emphasis on the **covenant structure** of Scripture has influenced generations of biblical theologians and contributed to a renewed appreciation for the unity of redemptive history. Kline’s work continues to provoke debate and reflection on the relationship between **law, covenant, and sin** in the Reformed tradition.
