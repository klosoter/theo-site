### TITLE
Inherited Corruption, Adamic Guilt, and the Goodness of God: Reformed Elucidation of the Nature and Origin of Sin

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How can human beings be truly responsible for **original sin** and pervasive **total depravity** if sin originates in Adam’s first transgression under **federal headship**, under the sovereignty and goodness of God.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Jonathan Edwards.
- Relevant traditions: Augustine’s Latin doctrine of **original sin**, medieval scholastic refinement, Reformation and post-Reformation **Reformed orthodoxy**, with contrast to Pelagian and contemporary analytic or revisionist accounts.
- Debates: Internal Reformed debates on **imputation** and the nature of concupiscence; external debates with Pelagian, semi-Pelagian, and libertarian accounts of freedom; contemporary debates about evolutionary origins, structural sin, psychological determinism, and theodicy.
- Defended position: A classical Augustinian–Reformed account in which all humans, by virtue of **federal representation** and **natural generation** from Adam, inherit both guilt and corruption, such that sin is a privative yet powerfully enslaving disorder of the will, fully under divine providence yet wholly imputable to human agents.

### ESSAY
The doctrine of the **nature and origin of sin** stands at a crucial intersection of theological loci. It touches **anthropology**, since it defines what it means to be human after the fall; **Christology** and **soteriology**, since it defines what kind of Savior and salvation are necessary; and **theology proper**, because it forces us to ask how the holy God stands in relation to a world permeated by moral evil. To defend a position here in an oral examination, one must be able to state concisely what sin is, where it comes from, how its origin can be reconciled with divine goodness and sovereignty, and why the Reformed account of **original sin** is not only exegetically but conceptually superior to alternatives.

The starting point must be a careful definition of sin’s nature. Following Augustine and the Reformed tradition, we define sin primarily as **lawlessness** in relation to God, that is, a morally culpable lack of conformity to and transgression of the divine moral law. Ontologically, sin is not a positive substance but a privation, a bentness or disordered lack in rational creatures that corrupts what God made good. To preserve the Creator–creature distinction and divine holiness, sin cannot be a created thing. Yet if sin is merely privation, an examiner will immediately press: How can a mere lack exercise such powerful causal influence, enslaving the will and corrupting all human faculties Typically, the answer must distinguish between sin as metaphysical privation and sin as morally qualified act and habitus. As a privation, sin has no positive being ordained by God; as a moral quality of a rational act or state, it is real enough to ground responsibility. The corruption of the will is a disorder of its ordering to God as last end, and that disorder inheres in real acts, habits, and dispositions of the soul. Thus the privation account does not reduce sin to a mere absence, but locates its “positivity” in the disordered acts and patterns of the creature, not in a substance produced by God.

Historically, Augustine is decisive at every turn. In his anti-Pelagian writings, especially On Nature and Grace, On the Spirit and the Letter, and Against Julian, and most synthetically in the Enchiridion, he forges the conceptual grammar that Western theology largely inherits. He argues that Adam was created upright in true **original righteousness**, with the posse non peccare, the ability not to sin. Through the first sin, a turning from the higher to the lower good out of pride, the human race fell into a condition of non posse non peccare, an inability not to sin. For Augustine, this is not simply imitation but **solidarity** with Adam as the root of the human race. He speaks of all humanity being “in Adam” as in a mass or lump. Through that one man, sin and death entered and passed to all. Children are born already under condemnation and with a vitiositas, a disease and perversity of the will. This is original sin, defined as both the guilt of Adam’s first sin and the corruption of nature we all inherit.

An examiner will likely push on whether Augustine teaches a realistic or federal view of transmission. Do we sin in Adam because we were somehow numerically included in his soul, or because he represented us By and large, Augustine’s language is more realistic and biological than the later Reformed federal schema, but he does employ legal and representative categories. The crucial point is that, for Augustine, the whole human race is one in Adam, so that Adam’s sin is both the sin of the individual and the sin of the massa. Pelagius objected that this makes God unjust and collapses moral responsibility. Pelagius redefined sin primarily as actual transgression and maintained that Adam’s sin injured only himself, leaving his descendants morally neutral and free to obey. Grace, on this view, becomes essentially external aid and example. Augustine saw this as a direct assault on the necessity of grace and on the church’s practice of infant baptism. If infants need baptism for the remission of sins, they must have some sin needing remission. That sin cannot be merely imitation, so it must be inherited **original sin**.

Here the external debate between Augustinianism and Pelagianism defines the contours of Western doctrine. Augustine insists that the universality of death and the pervasive bondage of the will testify that all are truly guilty in Adam. Yet he insists equally strongly that God is not the author of sin. How does he preserve both divine sovereignty and divine innocence He appeals to **divine providence** that orders even evil acts to good ends, while locating the moral origin of sin wholly in the creature’s will. God permits the fall, foreknows and ordains to permit it, and sovereignly uses it, but is in no way the efficient cause of the will’s defect. The defect is a turning from God to self that has no efficient cause in God, because defect by nature lacks the kind of being that would require a cause. Examiners will press the coherence of this “permission” under a strong providence. An Augustinian answer leans on the metaphysical asymmetry between being and nonbeing: God positively causes all creaturely being and every good inclination, while sin, as defect, is allowed rather than produced. This line of defense will later be elaborated by Reformed scholastics using doctrines of **concurrence** and **secondary causes**.

Thomas Aquinas receives Augustine’s doctrine of sin and clarifies its conceptual structure within the high medieval synthesis. In the Summa Theologiae, especially in the prima secundae questions 71 to 89, he expounds sin as a privation of due order in an act of a rational creature. For Aquinas, the first sin of Adam is a disordered choice of a created good as ultimate end, an act of pride. Original sin is the privation of original justice, which ordered the lower powers to reason and reason to God. When original justice is lost, the lower appetites rebel against reason, and concupiscence and disorder spread throughout human nature. Thomas’s account of **concupiscence** is central in later debates. For him, concupiscence is a disordered movement of the sensitive appetite, in itself involuntary and not yet formally sin unless consented to by the will. Yet it is a punishment of sin and an inclination to sin that all inherit by generation.

Aquinas also makes an important move in integrating Augustine’s realism with a more juridical account. Original sin is in all men as one sin of nature, not multiplied individually as actual sins are. It is not that God simply imputes Adam’s guilt extrinsically; more fundamentally, human nature, which is numerically one in Adam and his posterity, has been vitiated. The formal aspect of original sin is the privation of justice; the material aspect is concupiscence. Examiners may challenge: Does this not make God unjust by condemning persons for a sin that is formally in the nature rather than their individual choice Aquinas’s reply hinges on the unity of the human race in Adam as principle of nature. Nature is not an abstract essence; it is concretely communicated through generation. Thus the injustice would lie in denying that those derived from Adam share in his moral condition.

Thomas also refines Augustine’s theodicy. God is not morally responsible for sin, because sin as such is a falling short of order, which does not have God as cause. Yet God as first cause moves the created will to act, and no act escapes providence. When the creature defects in the mode of acting, that defect has no efficient cause in God but arises from the limited nature of the creature. Critics object that this seems to smuggle in a positive defect in the creature’s design. Aquinas counters that finitude is not itself sinful. Sin arises only when a rational creature, with sufficient natural and supernatural help, voluntarily turns away from due order. Thus the origin of sin lies in the will’s misuse of its real though dependent freedom.

The Reformation inherits the Augustinian–scholastic structure but sharpens it in polemical contexts. Martin Luther’s decisive contribution concerns the radicality of **bondage of the will** and the interiority of sin. In The Bondage of the Will against Erasmus and in his Romans lectures, Luther intensifies the Augustinian insight that sin is not primarily a catalog of acts but a deep curvature of the whole person away from God. Sin is unbelief, a theocentric revolt in which the sinner seeks to justify himself before God and to serve the creature rather than the Creator. For Luther, this inward corruption renders the human will unfree in spiritual things. It chooses according to its deepest inclination, and apart from regenerating grace that inclination is always away from God. He interprets concupiscence itself as sin, not merely an occasion for sin, because it is already a disordered movement contrary to the law of God.

At this point, examiners will press the internal debate with the Roman Catholic tradition, which, following Aquinas and clarified at Trent, identifies concupiscence as “from sin and inclining to sin” but not itself sin in the baptized. The Reformed side responds that Scripture’s depiction of the “flesh” and of inner desires contrary to the Spirit fits better with concupiscence as truly sinful. Calvin, in the Institutes especially book 2, expands on this and gives the classic Reformed formulation. He defines **total depravity** not as absolute evil in every act, but as the pervasive corruption of all faculties of soul and body such that man is utterly unable to convert himself or do any spiritual good. For Calvin, original sin is both hereditary depravity and imputed guilt. Children are born not only corrupted but already under condemnation because of Adam’s transgression.

Calvin clarifies more explicitly than Augustine or Aquinas the notion of **federal headship**. Adam is not only the natural root but the covenantal representative of humanity under a **covenant of works**. When he violates that covenant, its curse falls on all whom he represents. This lends strong juridical precision to the Reformed doctrine of **imputation**. Paul’s parallelism in Romans 5 between Adam and Christ grounds the doctrine: just as the many were constituted sinners through one man’s disobedience, so believers are constituted righteous through the obedience of the one. Examiners will likely question whether this forensic imputation is morally coherent. How can I be guilty of a sin I did not personally commit The Reformed answer is to defend corporate personality or federal representation as an inescapable feature of both biblical theology and ordinary moral life. Parents’ actions bind children, governments’ decisions bind citizens; more fundamentally, God has the right to constitute humanity under a public person. Adam’s representative role is not arbitrary but fitting, since he is the natural head from whom all descend. Moreover, the very same covenantal structure that exposes us to Adamic guilt is the means by which we receive the righteousness of Christ, which clearly we have not personally performed. To reject imputation in Adam is, by the Pauline parallel, to shake the ground of justification in Christ.

Within the Reformed orbit, Jonathan Edwards offers a particularly penetrating analysis of both the nature and origin of sin, using a more explicit philosophical psychology. In Original Sin and in Freedom of the Will, Edwards defends the reality of inherited depravity and guilt against Arminian critics. Conceptually, he argues that moral responsibility is compatible not with a power of contrary choice in the moment but with the ability to act according to one’s strongest motive and inclination. This is a compatibilist account of freedom that undergirds both human responsibility and **divine sovereignty** in ordaining the fall. For Edwards, humans are free when they act voluntarily from their own dispositions, even if those dispositions are themselves determined by antecedent causes under God’s providence. Thus original sin, as a fixed moral tendency away from God, does not remove responsibility but in fact explains the consistency of human wickedness.

On the specific mode of transmission, Edwards defends a form of “identity of the race” with Adam. Human nature is an abstract, yet really shared, thing that God upholds in existence through successive individuals. When God withdraws original righteousness from this nature upon Adam’s sin, all who share this nature are born destitute of that righteousness and inclined to evil. At the same time, Adam’s first sin is imputed to them as their own because of the moral union of nature, somewhat analogous to the way the sins of a community can be truly the sins of each member. Edwards here mediates between stricter “immediate imputation” and “mediate imputation” views that later Reformed theologians debate internally. Immediate imputation holds that Adam’s guilt is imputed to his posterity directly, with corruption as a just punishment. Mediate imputation makes corruption itself the basis for the imputation. While churches in the Westminster tradition historically favor immediate imputation, one must be able to articulate why both seek to preserve the inseparability of guilt and corruption. In oral defense, you should argue that Scripture’s language, especially Romans 5, and the parallel to justification, favor a model in which a real forensic act stands at the origin of our condemnation, not merely the recognition of an already corrupt condition.

The external debates remain pressing. Against Pelagianism and semi-Pelagianism, the Augustinian–Reformed tradition insists that the human race is not a collection of neutral choosers but a fallen mass under Adamic guilt and enslaving corruption. Sin’s origin for each individual is both historical and ontological. Historically, it traces back to Adam’s primal transgression. Ontologically, it is communicated by natural generation within a corrupted nature. Against libertarian accounts of freedom, which claim that responsibility requires the power of contrary choice, Augustinian compatibilism maintains that what matters morally is the congruence between the act and the agent’s character, not metaphysical indeterminism. Examiners will ask whether this makes sin inevitable and thus excusable. The answer must emphasize that inevitability under a corrupt disposition does not exonerate, because the sinner still acts voluntarily in accordance with what he loves. The necessity is moral, not physical. Likewise, with respect to God, the decree that permits the fall and ordains all that comes to pass does not compel the will but establishes the framework within which the will chooses according to its inclinations.

Contemporary debates raise new stress points on the doctrine’s coherence. One pressing challenge is the apparent conflict between a historical Adam and evolutionary accounts of human origins. If humanity emerged gradually from a population of hominins, how can a single first sin by a covenantal head ground universal guilt and corruption Various evangelical proposals attempt to model Adam as a representative drawn from a larger population or to reinterpret original sin as merely the universal pattern of individual sin. A robust Reformed position that respects Scripture’s covenantal structure and Romans 5’s historical Adam must at minimum affirm a real first human pair under a specific covenantal arrangement whose disobedience is historically first and theologically constitutive. Without this, the connection between Adam and Christ is undermined, and sin’s origin becomes a mere aggregate of individual missteps rather than a covenantal catastrophe.

Another contemporary issue is the rise of structural and systemic accounts of evil. Liberation theologies, critical race theory, and various social analyses highlight the ways unjust structures, institutions, and cultural patterns shape and amplify sin. A Reformed defense should gladly affirm that sin’s corruption extends to structures, laws, and cultures, not only individuals. Yet one must maintain that such structural sins presuppose and flow from personal sin. If examiners ask whether the doctrine of original sin underplays social evil, the response is that classical **total depravity** explains why every human project, including ostensibly neutral institutions, tends toward injustice when not ordered to God. Structural accounts without original sin risk explaining the crookedness of the world by other crooked lines rather than by a primal fall.

Psychology and neuroscience introduce further challenges. If certain harmful behaviors correlate with brain structures, genetic predispositions, or trauma, how can individuals be held responsible The Reformed position can acknowledge the complexity of factors that incline one person to certain sins more than another, and can affirm that such factors may mitigate human judgment. But it insists that the moral core of sin remains a willful turning from God to self within the measure of light one has. The universality and early onset of self-centeredness, deceit, and rebellion in children fits the doctrine of **inherited corruption** better than optimistic anthropologies. The therapeutic tendency to replace moral categories with medical ones must be resisted at the doctrinal level, even as pastoral practice carefully distinguishes between culpable sin and nonmoral suffering.

Finally, the doctrine of sin’s nature and origin bears directly on theodicy. Examiners will press you: Why did God permit the fall at all, if he foresaw the ocean of misery that would follow Augustine and Edwards point in the same direction. God’s purpose in permitting sin is to manifest the full range of his perfections, including justice and mercy, in a way impossible in an unfallen world. Without the fall, there would be no incarnation as Redeemer, no cross, no display of **substitutionary atonement**, no experience of **grace** against the dark backdrop of judgment. This does not mean sin is good in itself, but that God is so supremely good as to bring a greater good out of the permission of evil than would have existed without that permission. The crucial distinctions between God willing sin as such and God willing to permit sin for wise and holy ends must be jealously guarded. Otherwise, we collapse into either a dualism that limits God’s control or a fatalism that makes God the direct author of evil.

In sum, the nature and origin of sin, classically understood, is that all humans are born in a state of **original sin**, comprising both Adamic guilt and inward corruption, by virtue of their **federal union** and natural descent from Adam, the first covenant head of the race. Sin is a real though privative disorder of the will and affections, not a substance created by God, yet one that enslaves and permeates all of human life. It arises from a free though creaturely act in Adam, under divine providence but not caused by God as sin, and is transmitted by generation within a nature deprived of original righteousness. Alternative accounts, whether Pelagian, semi-Pelagian, libertarian, evolutionary, or merely structural and therapeutic, fail either to do justice to Scripture’s testimony, to maintain divine holiness and sovereignty together, or to explain the depth and universality of human wickedness. Only an Augustinian–Reformed account of **original sin**, wedded to **federal theology** and a strong doctrine of providence, can hold together the data of revelation and experience while preserving the integrity of the gospel, in which the second Adam undoes the catastrophe of the first.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Sin is a culpable privation and disorder of the will and life in relation to God’s law, and **original sin** is the inherited state of Adamic guilt and pervasive corruption communicated to all humans by **federal headship** and natural generation.
- Decisive figures: Augustine – mass of perdition, inherited guilt and corruption under adamic solidarity; Aquinas – sin as privation, original sin as loss of original justice and concupiscence in a unified nature; Luther – radical **bondage of the will**, concupiscence itself as sin; Calvin – **total depravity**, forensic **imputation** under a covenant of works; Edwards – compatibilist freedom, identity of the race with Adam and philosophical defense of inherited sin.
- Debates: Internal – immediate vs mediate imputation, concupiscence as sin, nuances of federal vs realist transmission; External – Pelagian and semi-Pelagian denial of inherited guilt, libertarian freedom, moral objections to imputation; Contemporary – historical Adam vs evolution, structural sin vs personal guilt, psychological determinism, and theodicy of God’s permission of the fall.
- Defended position: A classic Augustinian–Reformed view that all humans are truly guilty and corrupted in Adam by covenantal and natural union, that sin is a privation but powerfully enslaving, and that God sovereignly permits but does not cause sin as sin, using even the fall to magnify his justice and mercy in Christ the second Adam.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - How can God be sovereign over the fall without being the author of sin By distinguishing God’s positive causation of being and good from his permissive decree of defect as privation in secondary causes.
  - Why is inherited guilt just Because God constituted humanity under Adam as a righteous public person, whose representative act genuinely binds his posterity, just as Christ’s obedience binds his people.
  - Is concupiscence itself sin Yes, as a disordered inclination contrary to the law of God, though its presence can be distinguished from its consent and outward act.
  - How does this doctrine relate to Christ’s sinlessness Christ assumes true human nature without Adamic guilt or corruption, being conceived by the Spirit, thus qualifying as the new head who can bear and remove our sin.
  - What is lost if we reject original sin We lose the necessity and nature of regenerating grace, the coherence of justification by the righteousness of another, and a satisfying explanation of the depth and universality of human evil.
