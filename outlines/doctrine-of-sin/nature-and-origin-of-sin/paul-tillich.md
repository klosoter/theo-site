# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **nature and origin of sin** through an existential and ontological lens, framing sin as a state of **estrangement** from the **Ground of Being** rather than merely a moral infraction. For Tillich, sin is fundamentally about **alienation**—from God, self, and others—rooted in the existential condition of **finite freedom** and the anxiety of separation.

- "Sin is separation. To be in the state of sin is to be in the state of separation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

- The Protestant Era

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Estrangement**
   - Sin is primarily defined as **estrangement** from God, self, and community.
   - This estrangement is existential, not merely ethical or legal.
   - The human condition is marked by a state of separation from the **Ground of Being**.
   - Estrangement manifests in personal, social, and spiritual dimensions.
   - "Sin is the separation of man from the ground of his being, from other men, and from himself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Ontological, Not Merely Moral, Nature of Sin**
   - Sin is rooted in the structure of human existence, not just in individual acts.
   - It is a distortion of being, a falling away from essential nature.
   - The **ontological** dimension means sin is a universal human reality.
   - Sin is inseparable from the anxiety and ambiguity of finite existence.
   - "Sin is not a matter of isolated acts but of the whole state of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Sin as Unbelief and Hubris**
   - Unbelief is the refusal to accept one's dependence on the **Ground of Being**.
   - Hubris is the attempt to make oneself the center of existence.
   - Both are expressions of the will to autonomy and self-sufficiency.
   - These attitudes deepen the state of estrangement and reinforce separation.
   - "Unbelief is the expression of the state of estrangement from the ground of being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Origin of Sin in Existential Freedom**
   - The possibility of sin arises from human **freedom** and the anxiety it generates.
   - Freedom allows for the choice of separation as well as union with God.
   - The origin of sin is not a historical event but an existential reality for every person.
   - This existential origin underscores the universality and inevitability of sin.
   - "The origin of sin is the freedom of man to separate himself from his ground." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Sin’s Universality and Ambiguity**
   - All humans participate in the state of sin; it is a universal condition.
   - The ambiguity of human existence means good and evil are intertwined.
   - Sin is not simply the violation of a law but the distortion of being itself.
   - This universality points to the need for **reconciliation** and **grace**.
   - "Every man is in the state of sin, and every act participates in the ambiguity of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential analysis of **sin as estrangement** has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in conversations about the human condition and the relevance of Christian doctrine in a secular age. His ontological approach reframed sin beyond legal or moral categories, emphasizing its depth as a universal and existential reality. While some criticize his abstraction and departure from traditional doctrines of **original sin**, his work remains pivotal for understanding sin in dialogue with philosophy, psychology, and contemporary culture.
