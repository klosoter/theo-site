# Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758)

Jonathan Edwards developed a profound and nuanced doctrine of the **nature and origin of sin**, emphasizing the reality of **original sin** and the **bondage of the will**. He argued that sin arises from the **corrupt inclinations** of fallen humanity, rooted in Adam’s first transgression, and that all humans inherit a **sinful nature** apart from any personal act.

- "The ruin that Adam brought upon himself and all his posterity... was the loss of original righteousness, and the corruption of nature." (Original Sin)

## Key Works

- Original Sin
- Freedom of the Will
- The Great Christian Doctrine of Original Sin Defended
- Miscellanies (selected entries on sin and human nature)
- The Works of Jonathan Edwards (Yale Edition, vols. 1, 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Inherited Corruption**
    - All humanity participates in Adam’s first sin by virtue of **federal headship**.
    - The corruption of nature is transmitted to every human at conception.
    - Sin is not merely imitation but a real, inward depravity.
    - This depravity renders all people guilty and liable to condemnation.
    - "All mankind are, in consequence of Adam’s sin, born into the world with a corrupt nature." (Original Sin)

2. **Bondage of the Will**
    - Fallen human will is enslaved to sinful inclinations.
    - True moral freedom is lost apart from **regenerating grace**.
    - The will always chooses according to the strongest motive, which is corrupted in sinners.
    - Human inability is moral, not natural; sinners are responsible though unable to do good.
    - "The will is always determined by the strongest motive." (Freedom of the Will)

3. **Sin as Privation of Good**
    - Sin is fundamentally a lack or privation of original righteousness.
    - It is not a substance or positive entity but a disorder of the soul.
    - The loss of the image of God is central to the sinful condition.
    - Sinful acts flow from this privative state of the heart.
    - "Sin is the ruin or privation of that principle of holiness and righteousness." (Original Sin)

4. **Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God ordains all things, including the fall, without being the author of sin.
    - Human choices are real and morally significant within God’s providence.
    - The mystery of God’s sovereignty is compatible with genuine human culpability.
    - The origin of sin is permitted for the greater display of God’s glory.
    - "God’s permission of sin is not his being the author of it." (Freedom of the Will)

5. **Necessity of Regeneration**
    - Only the supernatural work of the **Holy Spirit** can overcome the bondage of sin.
    - Regeneration imparts a new principle of spiritual life and holiness.
    - Without regeneration, the sinner remains under the dominion of sinful nature.
    - The new birth restores the capacity for true obedience to God.
    - "A new and divine principle must be implanted in the soul." (Original Sin)

## Legacy and Impact

Edwards’s doctrine of **original sin** has profoundly shaped Reformed and evangelical understandings of human depravity and the necessity of grace. His rigorous defense of the **bondage of the will** and the moral inability of fallen humanity influenced later theologians such as Charles Hodge and B. B. Warfield. Edwards’s integration of **divine sovereignty** with human responsibility remains a touchstone in debates on the nature and origin of sin. His work continues to be foundational for discussions of anthropology and soteriology in the Reformed tradition.
