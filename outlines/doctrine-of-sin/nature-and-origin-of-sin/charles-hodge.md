# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a classic **Reformed doctrine of sin**, emphasizing its **origin in Adam’s transgression** and its propagation through **imputation and inherited corruption**. He maintained that **sin is not merely privation but positive enmity against God**, and that its entrance into the world is rooted in the **federal headship of Adam**. Hodge’s account upholds both the **sovereignty of God** and the **responsibility of man** in the context of original and actual sin.

- "Sin is any want of conformity unto, or transgression of, the law of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin Originates in Adam’s First Transgression**
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity in the covenant of works.
    - The guilt of Adam’s first sin is **imputed** to all his descendants.
    - This imputation is both **judicial** and **representative** in nature.
    - The entrance of sin is historical and not mythological.
    - "The sin of Adam is the judicial ground of the condemnation of his race." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Original Sin as Both Guilt and Corruption**
    - Original sin consists of both **imputed guilt** and **inherited depravity**.
    - All humans are born with a **corrupt nature** inclined toward evil.
    - This corruption is total, affecting every faculty of the soul.
    - The doctrine preserves the **distinction between guilt and pollution**.
    - "Original sin, therefore, as it exists in the human race, includes both guilt and pollution." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Sin as Positive Enmity, Not Mere Privation**
    - Sin is not simply the absence of good but active **opposition to God**.
    - The will is not neutral but **hostile** to divine law.
    - Human depravity is expressed in both **omission and commission**.
    - The moral inability of man is real, not hypothetical.
    - "Sin is not a mere negation, but a positive evil." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God is not the **author of sin**, though He sovereignly permits its existence.
    - Human beings are **morally responsible** for their sinful acts.
    - The permission of sin serves the **greater purposes of God’s glory**.
    - The mystery of sin’s origin does not undermine divine justice or goodness.
    - "God is not the author of sin, but its permitter." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Transmission of Sin by Natural Generation**
    - Sinful nature is transmitted through **ordinary generation**, not by creation.
    - The unity of the human race is both **natural and moral**.
    - The propagation of sin is not by imitation but by **hereditary descent**.
    - This view upholds the **solidarity of humanity** in both sin and redemption.
    - "The Scriptures teach that men are born in sin, and that their depravity is innate." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s formulation of the **nature and origin of sin** became a standard reference for American Presbyterian and Reformed theology. His careful articulation of **original sin, imputation, and inherited depravity** shaped generations of theologians at Princeton and beyond. While later theologians have nuanced or challenged aspects of his federal theology, Hodge’s work remains a touchstone for discussions of **human depravity** and the justice of God in permitting sin. His influence endures in both confessional Reformed circles and broader evangelical thought.
