# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther understood the **nature and origin of sin** as rooted in the radical corruption of human nature following the **Fall**. He emphasized **original sin** as a total depravity that affects every aspect of the human person, rendering humanity incapable of turning to God apart from **divine grace**. For Luther, sin is not merely a series of acts but a deep-seated condition of the will and heart.

- "Original sin is not a slight, but so deep a corruption of human nature that no reason can understand it; it must be believed because of the revelation in the Scriptures." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis
- The Bondage of the Will
- Commentary on Romans
- Small and Large Catechisms
- Heidelberg Disputation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Sin as Total Depravity**
    - Sin is not just an act but a pervasive condition inherited from Adam.
    - Human faculties—mind, will, and affections—are all corrupted.
    - Original sin renders humans incapable of fulfilling the **Law of God**.
    - The image of God is profoundly marred, though not annihilated.
    - "All men are full of evil lust and inclination from their mothers’ wombs." (Large Catechism)

2. **Sin as Unbelief and Rejection of God**
    - The essence of sin is unbelief, a turning away from God’s self-revelation.
    - Sin is fundamentally a matter of the heart’s orientation, not just external acts.
    - Even good works, apart from faith, are tainted by sin.
    - The first commandment is the root of all others; breaking it is the root of all sin.
    - "The root and source of sin is unbelief and turning away from God." (Heidelberg Disputation)

3. **Bondage of the Will**
    - The human will is in bondage to sin and cannot choose good apart from grace.
    - Free will, after the Fall, is a “mere word” without reality in spiritual matters.
    - Only the **Holy Spirit** can liberate the will to respond to God.
    - Human effort is powerless to overcome sin’s dominion.
    - "Man’s will is like a beast standing between two riders." (The Bondage of the Will)

4. **Sin’s Origin in the Fall**
    - Sin entered the world through Adam’s disobedience.
    - All humanity participates in Adam’s guilt and corruption.
    - The transmission of sin is both legal (guilt) and existential (corruption).
    - The Fall is a historical event with ongoing consequences for all.
    - "Through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin." (Commentary on Romans)

5. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - The **Law** reveals sin but cannot cure it.
    - The **Gospel** alone brings forgiveness and renewal.
    - The Law’s function is to drive sinners to despair of self-righteousness.
    - Sin is exposed and magnified by the Law, but only grace can heal.
    - "The Law says, ‘Do this,’ and it is never done. The Gospel says, ‘Believe this,’ and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s doctrine of **original sin** and the **bondage of the will** profoundly shaped Protestant understandings of human nature and salvation. His emphasis on the radical depth of sin underscored the necessity of **grace alone** for salvation and influenced later Reformed and Lutheran confessions. Luther’s insights continue to inform debates on **anthropology**, the role of the Law, and the nature of human freedom in relation to divine sovereignty.
