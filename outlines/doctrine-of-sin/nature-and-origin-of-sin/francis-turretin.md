# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust account of the **nature and origin of sin** within the framework of **Reformed orthodoxy**. He emphasized the distinction between **original sin** and **actual sin**, defended the doctrine of **imputed guilt**, and maintained that sin originated from the **free will** of Adam, not from God’s creative act, thus preserving **divine holiness** and **human responsibility**.

- "Sin is not a substance or a being, but an accident and corruption of a good nature." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Topics 8–10)
- Synopsis of Purer Theology (with Amandus Polanus and others)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)
- The Doctrine of Original Sin (in Institutes, Topic 9)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Privation and Corruption**
    - Sin is defined as a **privation** of original righteousness, not a substance in itself.
    - It is a **corruption** of human nature, affecting the whole person.
    - Turretin rejects any notion that sin is a positive entity created by God.
    - The **goodness of creation** is upheld; sin is a defect, not a substance.
    - "Sin is not a substance, but a privation and corruption of a substance." (Institutes, 9.2.1)

2. **Origin of Sin in Human Will**
    - The first sin originated in the **free will** of Adam, not by necessity.
    - Adam’s will was mutable, capable of both obedience and disobedience.
    - God permitted, but did not cause, the fall, thus preserving **divine impeccability**.
    - The **efficient cause** of sin is the creature’s will, not God’s decree.
    - "God is not the author of sin, but its permitter and orderer." (Institutes, 9.7.6)

3. **Transmission of Original Sin**
    - **Original sin** is transmitted to all Adam’s descendants by **natural generation**.
    - Both **guilt** (imputed) and **corruption** (inherited) are passed on.
    - Turretin affirms the **federal headship** of Adam in the covenant of works.
    - The whole human race is implicated in Adam’s first transgression.
    - "All men sinned in Adam as their representative and head." (Institutes, 9.9.3)

4. **Distinction Between Original and Actual Sin**
    - **Original sin** refers to the inherited state; **actual sins** are personal acts.
    - Actual sins flow from the corrupted nature received from Adam.
    - Both forms of sin render humanity liable to **divine judgment**.
    - The distinction safeguards the doctrine of **total depravity**.
    - "Original sin is the root; actual sins are the fruits." (Institutes, 9.11.1)

5. **God’s Providence and the Permission of Sin**
    - God’s **providence** extends to the permission of sin without being its author.
    - Sin occurs within God’s sovereign plan, yet God remains **holy** and **just**.
    - The distinction between God’s **decretive will** and **preceptive will** is crucial.
    - Turretin upholds **compatibilism**: human responsibility is compatible with divine sovereignty.
    - "God concurs in the act, but not in the evil of the act." (Institutes, 9.7.10)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s nuanced articulation of the **nature and origin of sin** became a standard within the Reformed scholastic tradition, shaping later confessional statements and theological education. His careful distinctions between **privation**, **corruption**, and **imputed guilt** influenced both continental and Anglo-American Reformed thought. Turretin’s defense of **divine holiness** and **human responsibility** continues to inform contemporary discussions on the doctrine of sin and theodicy.
