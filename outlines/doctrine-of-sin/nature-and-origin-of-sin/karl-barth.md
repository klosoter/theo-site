# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth approached the **nature and origin of sin** through the lens of **Christocentric revelation**, emphasizing that sin is fundamentally a rejection of the **divine command** and a distortion of genuine human freedom. For Barth, sin is not a metaphysical necessity but an **ontological impossibility** actualized by human disobedience, always defined in relation to the **grace of God** revealed in Jesus Christ.

- "Sin is the impossible possibility." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/2 (Doctrine of God)
- Church Dogmatics II/1 (Doctrine of God)
- Church Dogmatics II/2 (Election and Command)
- Church Dogmatics IV/1 (Doctrine of Reconciliation)
- The Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as the Impossible Possibility**
    - Sin is not a necessary aspect of human nature but a contradiction of true humanity.
    - It is described as an "impossible possibility"—real, yet fundamentally alien to God's intention.
    - Sin has no independent existence; it is parasitic on the good.
    - The reality of sin is only understood in light of **God's grace** and **revelation**.
    - "Sin is that which ought not to be, and which, in the deepest sense, cannot be." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Sin as Rejection of Divine Command**
    - Sin originates in humanity's refusal to obey the **divine command**.
    - It is an act of prideful autonomy, setting oneself against God's will.
    - The origin of sin is not explained by a causal mechanism but by the mystery of human freedom.
    - Barth resists speculative explanations of the Fall, focusing instead on the existential act of disobedience.
    - "Sin is man's refusal to accept his creatureliness." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

3. **Christological Definition of Sin**
    - Sin is defined in relation to the person and work of Jesus Christ.
    - Only in the light of **Christ's obedience** does the true nature of sin become clear.
    - Sin is exposed and judged by the revelation of God's righteousness in Christ.
    - The cross is the ultimate demonstration of both the seriousness of sin and the triumph of grace.
    - "Only in the light of Christ do we know what sin is." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Sin as Alienation and Estrangement**
    - Sin is the alienation of humanity from God, self, and others.
    - It disrupts the intended fellowship between Creator and creature.
    - This estrangement is not merely ethical but ontological, affecting the whole person.
    - Reconciliation is necessary to overcome this alienation, accomplished in Christ.
    - "Sin is the contradiction of the relationship in which man is set by God." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

5. **Universality and Radicality of Sin**
    - All humanity is implicated in sin; there are no exceptions.
    - Sin is not just individual acts but a pervasive condition.
    - The universality of sin highlights the necessity of **divine grace** and **election**.
    - Human efforts are insufficient; salvation is wholly God's work.
    - "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth's doctrine of sin profoundly shaped modern **Reformed theology**, challenging both liberal and traditional accounts by grounding the understanding of sin in **Christology** and divine revelation. His insistence on the "impossible possibility" of sin redirected theological focus from speculative origins to the existential reality of disobedience and the priority of grace. Barth's approach continues to influence discussions on **original sin**, human freedom, and the relationship between anthropology and soteriology.
