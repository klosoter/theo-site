# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin taught that **sin** is a pervasive corruption of human nature, originating in the **fall of Adam** and transmitted to all humanity. He emphasized the **total depravity** of the will and intellect, asserting that sin is not merely a series of acts but a profound disordering of the entire person, rooted in **original sin** and resulting in **guilt** and **alienation from God**.

- "Original sin, therefore, seems to be a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature, diffused into all parts of the soul." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 2.1.8)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 1–5)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on Genesis (especially Genesis 3)
- Sermons on Romans (notably Romans 5)
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)
- Calvin and the Reformation (ed. William Stacy Johnson)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Inherited Depravity**
   - Sin is not just imitation but a **hereditary corruption** passed from Adam to all his descendants.
   - Every aspect of human nature—mind, will, affections—is tainted by sin.
   - This depravity is present from conception and birth.
   - The universality of sin demonstrates humanity’s solidarity in Adam.
   - "We are so vitiated and perverted in every part of our nature that by this great corruption we stand justly condemned and convicted before God." (Institutes 2.1.8)

2. **Total Depravity**
   - Human faculties are thoroughly corrupted, not merely weakened.
   - No part of the person remains untouched by sin.
   - Even good deeds are tainted by sinful motives apart from grace.
   - The will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose true good without divine intervention.
   - "Man’s nature is not only bereft of all good, but so prolific in all kinds of evil that it can never be idle." (Institutes 2.1.9)

3. **Sin as Privation and Rebellion**
   - Sin is both a **privation** (lack of original righteousness) and an active rebellion against God.
   - It involves both guilt (legal standing) and corruption (moral pollution).
   - Sin is fundamentally directed against God’s law and order.
   - The disorder of sin affects both individual and communal life.
   - "Sin is not only the absence of good, but the active opposition to God’s righteousness." (Commentary on Genesis 3)

4. **Adam as Federal Head**
   - Adam acted as the **representative** of all humanity in the covenant of works.
   - His disobedience is imputed to all his descendants, resulting in universal guilt.
   - The transmission of sin is both legal (imputation) and real (corruption).
   - Christ, as the second Adam, reverses the effects of the fall for the elect.
   - "Adam, by his fall, not only ruined himself, but involved his posterity in the same ruin." (Institutes 2.1.6)

5. **Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
   - God is not the author of sin, though He sovereignly ordains all that comes to pass.
   - Human beings are fully responsible for their sinful actions.
   - The mystery of providence does not excuse or diminish human guilt.
   - God’s justice and holiness are upheld even in the permission of sin.
   - "For the proper and genuine cause of sin is not God’s hidden counsel but the evident will of man." (Institutes 3.23.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of the **nature and origin of sin** became foundational for the **Reformed tradition**, shaping subsequent confessions and catechisms. His articulation of **total depravity** and the federal headship of Adam influenced later theologians such as Turretin and the Westminster divines. Calvin’s careful distinction between God’s sovereignty and human responsibility continues to inform debates on the problem of evil and the anthropology of sin. His legacy endures in both academic theology and the practical piety of Reformed churches.
