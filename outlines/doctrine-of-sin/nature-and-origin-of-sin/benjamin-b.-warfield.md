# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated a robustly **Augustinian** understanding of the **nature and origin of sin**, emphasizing its reality as a moral corruption inherited from **Adam** through **original sin**. He maintained that sin is not merely a privation or weakness, but a positive inclination of the will against God, transmitted by **imputation** and **natural generation** to all humanity.

- "The race, having fallen in Adam, is born in sin and under condemnation." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Original Sin")

## Key Works

- "The Biblical Doctrine of Original Sin" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Human Development of Jesus" (in The Person and Work of Christ)
- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "Calvin and Augustine"
- "Perfectionism"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Moral Corruption**
   - Sin is a real, positive corruption of human nature, not merely the absence of good.
   - It involves the entire person: intellect, will, and affections.
   - Sin is fundamentally **rebellion against God** and His law.
   - This corruption is universal and affects all descendants of Adam.
   - "Sin is not a mere privation, but a positive perversion of human nature." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Original Sin")

2. **Original Sin and Imputation**
   - All humans are implicated in Adam's first transgression by **imputation**.
   - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity.
   - The guilt and corruption of Adam's sin are transmitted to his posterity.
   - This doctrine safeguards the necessity of **redemption in Christ**.
   - "We are sinners by nature because we are sinners in Adam." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Original Sin")

3. **Total Depravity**
   - Every aspect of human nature is affected by sin.
   - There is no part of man left untouched by depravity.
   - This does not mean utter depravity, but pervasive corruption.
   - Human inability to do spiritual good is a result of this depravity.
   - "The inability of man is not physical but moral." ("The Plan of Salvation")

4. **Transmission of Sin**
   - Sin is transmitted both by **natural generation** and **imputation**.
   - Warfield rejects Pelagian and semi-Pelagian accounts of sin’s origin.
   - He affirms the unity of the race in Adam as the basis for transmission.
   - The propagation of sin is a mystery, but biblically attested.
   - "The Scriptures teach that the race fell in Adam, and in him became subject to sin and death." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Original Sin")

5. **Necessity of Divine Grace**
   - Human beings are utterly dependent on **sovereign grace** for salvation.
   - The depth of sin highlights the necessity of regeneration by the Holy Spirit.
   - No human effort or natural ability can overcome original sin.
   - Grace is both necessary and sufficient to restore fallen humanity.
   - "It is only by the creative power of God that the sinner can be made alive." ("Perfectionism")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **original sin** and its transmission shaped twentieth-century Reformed theology, reinforcing the classical **Augustinian** and **Calvinistic** doctrines against modernist and Pelagian tendencies. His rigorous exegesis and theological clarity provided a bulwark for **orthodox Presbyterianism** and influenced generations of theologians at Princeton and beyond. Warfield’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of sin, human responsibility, and the necessity of grace.
