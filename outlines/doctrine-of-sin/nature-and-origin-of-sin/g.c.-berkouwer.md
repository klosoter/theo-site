# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **nature and origin of sin** with a strong emphasis on its existential reality and its disruption of the **created order**. He rejected both deterministic and dualistic explanations, insisting that **sin** is a profound act of **human responsibility** that corrupts the **imago Dei** and alienates humanity from God, yet always within the context of divine sovereignty and grace.

- "Sin is not a metaphysical given, but a disruption of the relationship between God and man." (Sin, p. 25)

## Key Works

- Sin (De zonde), Studies in Dogmatics
- Man: The Image of God, Studies in Dogmatics
- The Providence of God, Studies in Dogmatics
- General Revelation, Studies in Dogmatics

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Ethical, Not Metaphysical**
    - Sin is not a substance or ontological principle but an ethical rupture.
    - It arises from the misuse of human freedom, not from creation itself.
    - Berkouwer opposes any view that would make sin a necessary or eternal reality.
    - Sin is always parasitic upon the good, never self-sustaining.
    - "Sin is not a metaphysical given, but a disruption of the relationship between God and man." (Sin, p. 25)

2. **Human Responsibility and Guilt**
    - Sin is rooted in the willful act of man, not in divine causality.
    - The doctrine of original sin underscores solidarity in Adam, but not at the expense of personal guilt.
    - Berkouwer stresses the existential seriousness of guilt before God.
    - He rejects any explanation that would diminish human accountability.
    - "The reality of sin is inseparable from the reality of guilt." (Sin, p. 89)

3. **Rejection of Dualism**
    - Berkouwer denies any cosmic dualism between good and evil.
    - Sin is not an independent principle but a distortion of God’s good creation.
    - He critiques Gnostic and Manichaean tendencies in theology.
    - The origin of sin is always traced to the creature, not to God or an evil principle.
    - "Sin is not a second principle alongside God, but a revolt within His creation." (Sin, p. 41)

4. **Sin and the Imago Dei**
    - Sin corrupts but does not annihilate the image of God in humanity.
    - The imago Dei remains the basis for human dignity and responsibility.
    - Redemption is understood as the restoration of the image, not its replacement.
    - Berkouwer emphasizes the ongoing significance of the image even after the Fall.
    - "The image of God is not lost, but distorted and corrupted by sin." (Man: The Image of God, p. 72)

5. **Sin in the Context of Divine Providence**
    - God’s sovereignty is never compromised by the reality of sin.
    - Berkouwer maintains that God permits but does not cause sin.
    - The mystery of sin’s origin is preserved without resorting to speculation.
    - Providence includes God’s redemptive response to human rebellion.
    - "God’s providence is not threatened by the reality of sin, but encompasses even the fall." (The Providence of God, p. 110)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced treatment of **sin** influenced Reformed theology by emphasizing its ethical and relational dimensions rather than metaphysical speculation. His insistence on **human responsibility** and the rejection of dualism provided a corrective to both deterministic and existentialist trends. Berkouwer’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the **doctrine of sin**, especially in its relation to the **imago Dei** and divine providence. His careful engagement with both classical and contemporary sources continues to shape theological reflection on the nature and origin of sin.
