# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **nature and origin of sin** through the lens of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing God's **sovereignty**, the reality of **human responsibility**, and the mysterious compatibility of divine ordination with creaturely rebellion. He insists that sin is fundamentally **rebellion against God’s lordship**, arising from the heart, and that its origin, though permitted by God’s decree, is not caused by Him in a way that implicates Him in evil. Frame’s analysis is marked by his **triperspectivalism**, integrating normative, situational, and existential perspectives on sin.

- "Sin is irrational, for it is rebellion against the ultimate rationality, the wisdom of God." ("Doctrine of God")

- Perspectives on the Doctrine of God (2008)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty and the Decree**
   - God ordains all that comes to pass, including the existence of sin, without being the author of sin.
   - Divine sovereignty is compatible with genuine human responsibility.
   - The decree of God is ultimate, but it does not violate the moral agency of creatures.
   - The origin of sin is permitted for God’s wise and holy purposes, though its ultimate rationale remains mysterious.
   - "God’s sovereignty is so comprehensive that it includes even the sinful acts of his creatures, though he himself is not morally culpable." (Doctrine of God)

2. **Sin as Rebellion Against Lordship**
   - Sin is fundamentally a rejection of God’s authority and a refusal to submit to His law.
   - The essence of sin is autonomy—seeking to live independently of God.
   - Sin distorts every aspect of human existence: thought, will, and emotion.
   - The biblical narrative frames sin as treason against the Creator-King.
   - "Sin is the refusal to acknowledge God’s lordship in every area of life." (Doctrine of the Christian Life)

3. **Triperspectival Analysis of Sin**
   - Sin can be analyzed normatively (violation of God’s law), situationally (in context of God’s world), and existentially (in the heart of the sinner).
   - Each perspective is interdependent and necessary for a full understanding of sin.
   - The normative perspective highlights the objective standard of God’s command.
   - The existential perspective focuses on the subjective motives and desires that give rise to sinful acts.
   - "We must see sin from the perspective of God’s norm, the situation in which we act, and our own hearts." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Human Responsibility and Moral Agency**
   - Humans are morally accountable for their sin, even though God ordains all things.
   - The mystery of compatibilism: divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both true.
   - Scripture affirms that God is not the author of sin, yet nothing falls outside His providence.
   - The will is not coerced; sinners act freely according to their corrupt desires.
   - "Scripture never relieves us of responsibility for sin, even as it affirms God’s comprehensive control." (Doctrine of God)

5. **Theological Mystery and Antinomy**
   - The origin of sin involves a genuine theological mystery that cannot be fully resolved by human reason.
   - Frame warns against rationalistic attempts to explain away biblical tensions.
   - The coexistence of God’s sovereignty and human sinfulness is an antinomy to be accepted, not solved.
   - Humility before Scripture is required when addressing the problem of evil and sin’s origin.
   - "We must be content to accept the biblical teaching, even when it transcends our understanding." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s treatment of the **nature and origin of sin** has shaped contemporary Reformed thought, especially through his emphasis on **triperspectivalism** and the balance of divine sovereignty with human responsibility. His work has provided clarity and nuance to debates on the problem of evil, influencing pastors, theologians, and students in the Reformed tradition. Frame’s insistence on theological humility and fidelity to Scripture continues to guide discussions on the most challenging doctrines of the Christian faith.
