# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the classical **attributes of God**—such as **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**—by grounding them in the **feeling of absolute dependence** and the immediacy of **religious experience**. He critiqued traditional metaphysical approaches, insisting that the doctrine of God must be shaped by the dynamics of human consciousness rather than abstract speculation.

- "All attributes ascribed to God can only be expressions of the feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redefinition of Divine Simplicity**
    - Rejects classical metaphysical simplicity as speculative and detached from religious experience.
    - Argues that **simplicity** should be understood as the unity of God’s action in the world.
    - Emphasizes God’s unity as experienced in the **feeling of absolute dependence**.
    - Sees doctrinal formulations as secondary to the immediacy of religious consciousness.
    "The unity of the divine essence is not a logical or metaphysical abstraction, but the living unity experienced in piety." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Aseity as Relational Dependence**
    - Maintains that God is not dependent on the world, but this is known only through the human sense of dependence.
    - Reinterprets **aseity** as God’s absolute causal activity, not as isolation from creation.
    - Denies that aseity means God is wholly other or inaccessible.
    - Stresses that God’s aseity is manifest in the ongoing relationship with the world.
    "God is the whence of our self-consciousness, not an object among objects." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Immutability as Faithfulness, Not Stasis**
    - Critiques the notion of God’s **immutability** as unchangeability in being or will.
    - Proposes that immutability refers to God’s constancy in relation to creation.
    - God’s faithfulness is experienced in the unchanging ground of religious feeling.
    - Rejects the idea that immutability excludes divine responsiveness.
    "The divine immutability is the constancy of the divine causality in the world." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Impassibility Reinterpreted Through Divine Sympathy**
    - Discards the classical notion of **impassibility** as freedom from all emotion or suffering.
    - Argues that God is affected by the world in a way consistent with divine perfection.
    - Sees divine sympathy as essential to God’s relationship with humanity.
    - Maintains that impassibility must be compatible with God’s loving engagement.
    "God is not impassible in the sense of being unaffected, but in the sense of being perfectly loving." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Primacy of Religious Experience Over Metaphysics**
    - Asserts that doctrines about God’s attributes must arise from the experience of faith.
    - Rejects speculative metaphysics as the basis for understanding God.
    - Prioritizes the **feeling of absolute dependence** as the source of theological knowledge.
    - Holds that all talk of God’s attributes is secondary to the immediacy of piety.
    "Dogmatic theology is nothing other than the scientific exposition of the religious self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of the **divine attributes** marked a decisive shift from classical theism to a modern, experiential approach to the **doctrine of God**. His influence is seen in later liberal theology, process thought, and existentialist approaches to religion. By grounding theology in the **feeling of absolute dependence**, he challenged metaphysical accounts and opened the way for new discussions on divine relationality and responsiveness. His legacy remains controversial among confessional theologians but foundational for modern discussions of God’s nature.
