# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity—comprising the **Belgic Confession**, **Heidelberg Catechism**, and **Canons of Dort**—articulate the classic Reformed doctrine of **God’s attributes**, including **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. These confessions affirm that God is wholly self-sufficient, unchanging, and not subject to passions as creatures are, grounding these attributes in the unity and perfection of the divine being. Their formulations serve as foundational standards for Reformed orthodoxy on the doctrine of God.

- "We believe in one only God, who is a simple and spiritual Being; He is eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, immutable, infinite, almighty, perfectly wise, just, good, and the overflowing fountain of all good." (Belgic Confession, Art. 1)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 1–2
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 26–28
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. First Head, Article 7
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English edition)
- The Reformed Confessions: Harmonized Index and Commentary (ed. James Dennison, for reference)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity**
   - God is not composed of parts, qualities, or changeable elements.
   - His attributes are identical with His essence; there is no division in God.
   - Simplicity undergirds the unity and perfection of the divine being.
   - The confessions explicitly deny any composition or mutability in God.
   - "We believe in one only God, who is a simple and spiritual Being..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 1)

2. **Divine Aseity**
   - God exists from Himself and depends on nothing outside Himself.
   - He is the "overflowing fountain of all good," the source of all being.
   - Aseity distinguishes God from all created things, which are contingent.
   - The confessions stress God’s self-sufficiency and independence.
   - "He is...the overflowing fountain of all good." (Belgic Confession, Art. 1)

3. **Divine Immutability**
   - God does not change in His being, purposes, or promises.
   - Immutability is linked to God’s faithfulness and reliability.
   - The confessions affirm that God remains the same eternally.
   - This attribute assures believers of God’s steadfastness in salvation.
   - "He is...immutable..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 1)

4. **Divine Impassibility**
   - God is not subject to emotional fluctuations or suffering as creatures are.
   - Impassibility protects the Creator-creature distinction.
   - The confessions imply impassibility by denying change and composition in God.
   - God’s love and wrath are understood as perfections, not passions.
   - "He is...immutable..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 1)

5. **Theological Method: Confessional and Scriptural Foundation**
   - The Three Forms ground their doctrine of God in Scripture and the catholic tradition.
   - They use biblical language to describe God’s attributes, emphasizing revelation.
   - The confessions aim to safeguard the mystery and majesty of God.
   - Their formulations serve as boundaries for Reformed theological reflection.
   - "We know Him by two means: first, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe...second, by His holy and divine Word..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped the **Reformed doctrine of God**, establishing enduring confessional boundaries for understanding divine attributes such as **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. Their formulations continue to guide Reformed churches worldwide, providing a standard for orthodoxy and theological reflection. By rooting these doctrines in both Scripture and the catholic tradition, the Three Forms have ensured their ongoing relevance in systematic theology and ecumenical dialogue.
