### ESSAY
The doctrine that God is a se, simple, immutable, and impassible is one doctrine articulated through coordinated negations and affirmations. **Aseity** names God’s from-himselfness: God is not derived, composed, or caused. That aseity entails **divine simplicity**: if God has no cause he has no prior principles, no composition of act and potency, essence and existence, form and matter, substance and accidents, nature and really distinct attributes. From simplicity, **immutability** follows: what has no potency cannot undergo real change. And from immutability follows **impassibility**: the divine life is not vulnerable to passions or suffering as effects imposed from without. These are not speculative decorations but entailments of the God confessed in Scripture who creates ex nihilo, who is perfect, whose name is I am, who is light with no shadow of change, who does not repent as a man, who is love. The conceptual grammar that clarifies them is not an alien imposition but an analytic of biblical monotheism and trinitarian confession, binding together the loci of God, creation, providence, Christology, and salvation.

Augustine begins the Western articulation by binding biblical confession to a converted Platonism. Confronting Manichean dualism and Arian subordination, he reorients theology to the one simple and immutable God. In Confessions and De Trinitate he renders a grammar in which God is the immutable truth, eternity as the timeless present, the creator who gives being without diminution, and the triune life as subsistent relations of origin in the one simple essence. His doctrine of **eternity** as the totum simul denies temporal succession in God, safeguarding **immutability**; God does not become what he was not. Augustine’s interpretive method, guided by Scripture and attuned to **analogical predication**, reads anthropomorphic and anthropopathic passages as accommodated revelation that truly signifies God’s actions and will while refusing to attribute creaturely passions as such to God. When Scripture says God repents, he explains, this signifies a change in the creature’s relation and a different administration of the one immutable will, not a fluctuation in God. When Scripture depicts divine anger, Augustine construes it as the just will opposing evil, not a storm of affect. He thereby seeds a distinction later sharpened as **extrinsic denomination**: there are real changes in effects and relations on the creature’s side, and new names for God from us, without intrinsic change in God.

Augustine’s trinitarian doctrine is crucial for defending simplicity. The Father, Son, and Spirit are not parts of God. The three are one because the divine essence is identically and wholly possessed by each person. The persons are truly distinct, not by accidents, but by eternal relations of origin, without composition in the essence. This structure answers a perennial examiner’s challenge: if God is simple, how are there three persons? The answer is that the divine essence is numerically one and simple, while the real personal distinctions are relations of origin immanent to that essence. Augustine supplies the grammar of a God without parts who is triune, bringing the whole edifice of **divine simplicity** under the rule of the Trinity rather than at odds with it.

Thomas Aquinas receives and systematizes Augustine into a metaphysical clarity that Westminster examiners will expect a candidate to command. In Summa Theologiae I.3–26 and De ente et essentia he argues that letting composition into the first cause destroys **aseity**. Composition requires a composer or a prior principle. But God as first cause is uncaused. Therefore God is not composed of essence and existence; God is ipsum esse subsistens, the subsisting act of to be. God is not compounded of form and matter, act and potency, genus and difference, substance and accident. From that framework **immutability** follows: change is the reduction of potency to act; God as **actus purus** has no potency and thus cannot change. From immutability **impassibility** follows: passion presupposes the patient receiving the act of another; but in God there is no reception introducing new actuality. Thomas’s aim is not an abstract coldness but the intensification of divine life: God is pure actuality of intellect and will; he is not deprived of life but is life most eminently. This also secures **aseity** in the order of knowledge and goodness. If God’s goodness were something added to him, he would depend on it. But in God essence and perfections are identical in re even if our concepts distinguish them. Divine attributes are many to us by different rationes but one in God. When pressed with the classic query, is God identical to his attributes, the classical answer is yes in reality, not by synonomy of terms but by identity of the simple act, so that love, wisdom, justice name one res under differing formalities.

Thomas’s account of **analogical predication** likewise prevents the two failures examiners will probe for: equivocity that empties Scripture of cognitive content, and univocity that drags God into the creaturely genus. We name God from creatures as first cause and final end; the perfections that are pure are in God preeminently and are said analogically. Thomas’s method allows one to affirm concrete biblical claims under a controlled logic: God truly knows, wills, loves, speaks, repents in the sense of changing the economy to match his eternal will, yet does not suffer change or passion. This also finances a precise distinction between passions and affections in God. In us love is often a passion presupposing change; in God, love is pure act of will. Hence the older Reformed language that God is without passions does not deny divine love but purges it of creaturely passivity.

Two further Thomistic clarifications address contemporary debates. First, the fear that **divine simplicity** entails modal collapse. If God is identical to his act of willing, and necessarily exists, then is the world necessary? Thomas answers by distinguishing absolute necessity in God from the contingency of effects. God necessarily wills himself and wills creatures not from compulsion but by free choice. The content of the divine decree concerning creatures is not necessary by nature; it is contingent because it could have been otherwise, and the necessity of the decree is hypothetical from the standpoint of creatures. The decree is eternal and immutable, but what it specifies can be contingent in the effect. The key is that the relation of God to the world is extrinsic; God’s willing is not measured by temporal succession. What is necessary in God does not transfer necessity to the creaturely effect per se; thereby **extrinsic denomination** protects contingency without implying divine passivity. Second, the problem of prayer and temporal responsiveness. A Thomist answers: God wills from eternity the free prayers of creatures as secondary causes and the consequent changes in providence. There is a real relation from creatures to God and a semantic change in divine relational names, but no real change in God.

John Duns Scotus is decisive because his corrections and departures frame later internal debates. Scotus affirms **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** but thinks the Thomist apparatus risks theological vacuity. He insists on the **univocity** of being for the minimal concept of being without which we cannot meaningfully reason from creatures to God. He also introduces the **formal distinction**, a middle way between real and purely conceptual distinction. In God, certain formalities such as wisdom and power are not really distinct things but formally distinct aspects irreducible to one another even in the one essence. This aims to avoid the collapse worry, preserve real differentiation of attributes, and underwrite the intelligibility of theology. He sharpens divine freedom, pressing that God could have willed an alternative moral order, and that divine will is the supreme principle.

The Scotist program offers resources against certain modern criticisms, yet it pressures the Augustinian–Thomist confidence in **analogical predication**. If the cost of preserving intelligibility is univocity, one risks making God a member of the genus being and reintroducing a composition of God and properties as really or quasi really distinct aspects. The classical defense is that analogy, not univocity, is the only way to honor the Creator–creature distinction without equivocation. The necessity of a minimal univocal concept is overstated; we can know God truly though not comprehensively by causal remotion and eminence. And the formal distinction, while ingenious, invites reifying aspects into parts and risks undermining **simplicity**. The counter is that the Thomist rationes already preserve differentiation at the level of thought without multiplying distinctions in re. Examiners will ask whether this makes attributes verbal distinctions only; the answer is no. The distinctions are grounded in God’s simple act as termini of true predication, yet without real composition.

John Calvin represents the Reformed reception and sharpening of this doctrine in an exegetical and pastoral key. He is relentless about the Creator–creature distinction and the necessity of **aseity**. God needs nothing; all things are from him. He affirms **immutability** and **impassibility** in his commentaries and in the Institutes. Yet he divests the doctrine of scholastic pedantry by placing it within biblical economy. God speaks baby talk to us; anthropomorphic and anthropopathic language is a condescension in covenant. To say God repents is to say his administration toward us alters according to his one eternal will. To say God is angry is to say he judges. This is not semantic trickery but reverence for the distance between God and our concepts. Calvin’s Christology solidifies the doctrine. Through the extra Calvinisticum he refuses to collapse divinity into the humanity of Christ. The Son truly suffered and died according to the human nature he assumed, but the divine nature remained immutable and impassible. This is not docetism but Chalcedonian two-natures precision refracted through **impassibility**. The Reformed confessions codify this grammar. Westminster Confession 2.1 identifies God as without parts or passions. The point is not that God lacks concern but that in God there is no pathos of passivity. Here Reformed scholastics like Turretin and later orthodox voices align with Augustine and Thomas, while defending the absolute sovereignty of divine will and the contingency of the world through a decree that is eternal, free, and not conditioned by creatures.

A live internal Reformed debate concerns whether the confession’s “without passions” can be harmonized with talk of God’s suffering in love. Some recent proposals define passibility as an aspect of covenantal vulnerability. The classical Reformed response insists that covenantal responsiveness does not require ontological passibility. The covenant is the free arena of God’s immutable will; all relational language is accommodated and speaks truly of God’s works and determinations. One can speak, with patristic precedent, of God’s **impassible love**, meaning love as the pure actuality of willing good, maximal and unlosable, not dependent and wounded. When asked whether this drains biblical pathos, answer that it intensifies it by grounding it in the sheer act of God’s goodness rather than in creaturely turbulence.

Jürgen Moltmann stands as a modern alternative that forces the question. In The Crucified God he argues that the aftermath of Auschwitz and the pathos of Scripture require a suffering God. The classical doctrine of **impassibility**, he says, is metaphysical insulation that mutes love. Trinitarianly reframed, God suffers in differentiated ways in the persons. Moltmann’s proposal places the cross in God. This promised a pastoral immediacy and a theological revolution. But it dissolves **immutability** and risks conflating act and potency in God. It reconfigures the doctrine of God by a modern metaphysic of becoming and compromises **aseity** by making God’s identity essentially related to history’s contingencies. It also creates a methodological inversion, judging the metaphysics by a modern existential imperative rather than by Scripture’s whole counsel interpreted under the rule of faith and creeds. A classical reply affirms with full force that God is not apathetic. The Son of God suffered and died for us according to his assumed humanity. The cross reveals the eternal love of the triune God, not a new becoming in God. It is precisely **impassibility** that secures the depth of divine compassion: God’s love is not reactive sentiment but the free, antecedent, and invincible determination to save. If asked whether the Father forsook the Son in being, answer no; there is no rupture in the Trinity. There is the economic dereliction of the incarnate Son according to his human experience under the curse, while the eternal communion of the persons remains impassible. Pastoral solicitude is not purchased by ontological change in God but by the hypostatic union and the economy of redemption.

Alvin Plantinga, representing analytic theism, presses a different set of challenges that sharpen **aseity** and **simplicity**. In Does God Have a Nature he argues that classic simplicity is difficult to render coherent on a contemporary property theory. If God is identical to his properties, oddities follow: God is a property, properties are persons, and the distinction among attributes evaporates. Moreover, **aseity** seems threatened by necessary abstracta such as propositions and numbers; if these exist necessarily and independently of God, **aseity** fails. And if they are divine thoughts identical with God, then God depends on them for his nature, or the identity claims trivialize theology. Plantinga prefers a robust theism that admits some complexity in God and denies that God is identical to his nature, opposing the medieval package.

The classical response recruits both Augustine and Thomas. On the property problem, the medievals do not treat attributes as abstracta in the modern sense. They are modes of predication indicating one simple reality through diverse concepts. To say God is identical to his goodness is not to assert identity with a Fregean property but to deny composition: there is no universal Goodness added to God. It is a metaphysical rather than a set-theoretic identity claim. The worry that identity erases differentiation is answered by the doctrine of many rationes grounded in one res. Moreover, divine knowledge and will are not accidental to God but identical with the essence. The distinction among mercy and justice, for example, is real in effects and conceptually distinct with respect to their terminus, yet is one in God. On **aseity** and abstract objects, the Augustinian–Thomist doctrine of divine ideas takes the perfections of creatures as precontained eminently in the simple act of God’s knowing. There are not necessary abstracta existing alongside God. Rather, the necessity of numbers and propositions is a created or conceptual necessity grounded in God’s **aseity**, not violations of it. When an examiner presses whether this collapses mathematics into God’s will and threatens its objectivity, answer that the divine ideas are not arbitrary products of will but the necessary knowledge God has of himself as the exemplar of all possible participation. This secures both necessity and **aseity** without a Platonic realm. On modal collapse, the classical reply, already sketched, insists on the difference between the necessity of the divine willing and the contingency of the object of that will, preserved by **extrinsic denomination**, the freedom of indifference in God concerning creatures, and the fact that divine power extends to alternatives that are not actualized.

Bringing these strands together, the classical Reformed position defended here is that **aseity** is the controlling principle. It excludes composition and dependence and so yields **divine simplicity** as the structural truth about God’s being. From there, **immutability** and **impassibility** are not ad hoc add-ons but entailments: no potency, no change; no passivity, no passions. The Trinity rests on the simplicity of the essence and the real personal distinctions as eternal **Trinitarian relations of origin**. The incarnation is the person of the Son assuming a passible human nature without change in the divine nature, secured by the extra Calvinisticum. Providence is the execution in time of the one eternal decree, with genuine secondary causes that pray and act, whose relations to God are real on the creature’s side. The language of Scripture is true under **analogical predication** and accommodated pedagogy; it is not evacuated by the doctrine. God’s love is not threatened but clarified by **impassibility** as perfect act. The pastoral worry about a distant deity is answered by our being united to the Son who brings us to the Father in the Spirit, not by importing passivity into God.

Anticipating two final objections, first, that **divine simplicity** is a philosophical import foreign to Scripture. The right answer is that ex nihilo creation, I am who I am, the denial that God is like a man that he should repent, and the universal providence of the one Lord demand a metaphysics that excludes dependence and parts. The church’s sustained reasoning, from Augustine to Thomas to Reformed orthodoxy, is not an imposition but a disciplined hearing. Second, that simplicity is incompatible with the Trinity. The classical answer is precise: the divine essence is simple. The three persons are not parts or accidents but subsisting relations whose opposition to each other does not introduce composition in the essence. This is not an evasion but the settled grammar of catholic trinitarianism. If asked to state it bluntly: simplicity secures monotheism; relations of origin secure trinity; their conjunction is the only way to avoid tri-theism and modalism.

The stakes are high because these attributes discipline the whole system. Without **aseity** God shares the order of being with creatures. Without **simplicity** God is caused by his parts or by properties more basic than he is. Without **immutability** God is measured by time and becomes relative to history. Without **impassibility** God’s love and knowledge are subject to pathos. The result would be a god among gods, a personal being maximally great by degree but not the holy Creator. The classical confession, conversely, gives us the triune Lord whose life is pure act, whose freedom is the font of creaturely contingency, whose love is invincible, and whose nearness is not the nearness of a co-sufferer but of the one who can save. In oral defense, one must keep predicate discipline: we predicate perfections of God analogically as pure, in him eminently and identically; we predicate mixed perfections with negations and eminence; we treat passions as metaphors for volitional perfections and just judgments. We guard the border between intrinsic and extrinsic change. We keep Christology Chalcedonian. And we let **divine simplicity** do the heavy lifting that Scripture’s God requires, not as a desert of attributes but as the luminous unity of the living God.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Aseity** means God is from himself, without cause; this grounds **divine simplicity** as absence of all composition, which entails **immutability** as absence of real change and **impassibility** as absence of passivity or passions, all under **analogical predication**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: Scripture-governed simplicity, **eternity**, triune relations, anthropopathic accommodation, extrinsic change.
  - Thomas Aquinas: God as ipsum esse subsistens, **actus purus**, identity of attributes with essence, **extrinsic denomination**, freedom without **modal collapse**.
  - John Duns Scotus: **univocity** and **formal distinction** to preserve intelligibility and differentiate attributes; affirms simplicity but modifies its account.
  - John Calvin: Reformed reception, covenantal accommodation, WCF “without parts or passions,” extra Calvinisticum securing **impassibility** in Christology.
  - Jürgen Moltmann: rejects **impassibility** for a suffering God; classical critique defends immutability and triune love without divine becoming.
  - Alvin Plantinga: analytic critique of simplicity and **aseity** via properties and abstracta; classical reply via divine ideas and non-Fregean reading of attribute identity.
- Debates:
  - Internal: analogy vs univocity, real vs formal vs rational distinctions of attributes, compatibility of simplicity with Trinity and freedom, Reformed construal of “without passions.”
  - External: **process theology**, **open theism**, theistic personalism, analytic property-theoretic objections.
  - Contemporary: modal collapse, prayer and providence under **immutability**, abstract objects and **aseity**, biblical pathos and **impassible love**.
- Defended position: A classical Augustinian–Thomist account, received in Reformed orthodoxy, in which **aseity** entails **simplicity**, which entails **immutability** and **impassibility**, all coherent with triune relations, incarnation, creaturely contingency, and biblical revelation.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does simplicity contradict the Trinity? No, persons are subsistent relations of origin in the one simple essence, not parts.
  - Does immutability make prayer pointless? No, prayers are secondary causes willed eternally, producing real changes in effects via **extrinsic denomination**.
  - Is impassibility unloving? No, it secures love as pure act, not reactive passion; Christ suffered according to his human nature.
  - Does simplicity cause modal collapse? No, God necessarily wills himself but freely wills contingents; necessity in God does not transfer to effects.
  - What about abstract objects and aseity? Divine ideas ground necessary truths in God’s **aseity**; there is no co-eternal realm of abstracta.
