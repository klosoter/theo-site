# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, robustly defended the classical attributes of God, including **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. He maintained that these perfections are essential to the **divine nature**, ensuring that God is wholly independent, unchangeable, and unaffected by external forces, while still affirming God's personal engagement with creation.

- "God is independent, self-existent, and immutable; and therefore, all that is in Him is necessary and eternal." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons
- "God" in The Princeton Review (various articles)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity**
    - God is not composed of parts or passions; His attributes are identical with His essence.
    - Simplicity safeguards the unity of the divine nature against all forms of division or composition.
    - All divine perfections are fully and equally present in God at all times.
    - Simplicity is foundational for understanding other divine attributes.
    - "The attributes of God are not so many different parts of his essence, but only different modes in which his essence exists." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Aseity of God**
    - God exists from Himself and depends on nothing outside Himself.
    - Aseity undergirds God's independence from creation and His absolute self-sufficiency.
    - This attribute distinguishes the Creator from all creatures.
    - God's aseity is the basis for His sovereignty and authority.
    - "God is self-existent, that is, He exists by the necessity of His own being, and is not dependent on anything out of Himself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Immutability**
    - God is unchangeable in His being, perfections, purposes, and promises.
    - Immutability ensures the reliability and faithfulness of God.
    - Change is incompatible with the perfection and infinity of the divine nature.
    - Scriptural testimony is central to Hodge’s affirmation of this doctrine.
    - "God is absolutely immutable in his essence and attributes." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Impassibility**
    - God is not subject to suffering, pain, or involuntary passions.
    - Impassibility preserves the transcendence and perfection of God.
    - Hodge distinguishes between metaphorical language about God’s emotions and literal divine experience.
    - This attribute does not negate God’s active love or care for creation.
    - "The Scriptures attribute to God affections, but they are not to be understood as implying change or passion in Him." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Personal Engagement with Creation**
    - God’s attributes do not preclude His real relationship with the world.
    - Hodge affirms that God acts, loves, and responds in accordance with His eternal purpose.
    - Divine perfections are compatible with God’s providence and redemptive acts.
    - The classical attributes safeguard, rather than undermine, God’s covenant faithfulness.
    - "God is not an abstract being, but a personal Spirit, who enters into covenant with His people." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** became a benchmark for Reformed orthodoxy in America. His influence shaped generations of theologians at Princeton and beyond, reinforcing the classical doctrine of God against modern revisions. While later theologians have debated aspects of his approach, Hodge’s systematic clarity and biblical grounding continue to inform contemporary discussions of the divine attributes.
