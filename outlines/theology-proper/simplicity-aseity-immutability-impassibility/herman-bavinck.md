# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck robustly affirms the **divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility** as essential attributes of the classical Christian doctrine of God. He insists that God is wholly independent, unchanging, and not subject to passions, while also emphasizing that these attributes must be understood in harmony with God’s living, personal nature as revealed in Scripture. Bavinck seeks to uphold the **unity of God’s being** and the **distinction between Creator and creature** without compromising the fullness of God’s self-revelation.

- "God is absolutely simple; his being is identical with all his attributes." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Volume II: God and Creation
- Philosophy of Revelation
- The Doctrine of God (abridged selections)
- "The Catholicity of Christianity and the Church" (essay)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity is Foundational**
    - God’s essence is not composed of parts or attributes; all that is in God is God.
    - Simplicity safeguards the unity and indivisibility of the divine being.
    - Rejects any notion of real composition or division in God.
    - Attributes are not additions to God’s essence but identical with it.
    - "God is not composed of various parts; he is simple, pure being." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

2. **Aseity as Absolute Self-Existence**
    - God exists from himself and is dependent on nothing outside himself.
    - Aseity undergirds God’s independence and self-sufficiency.
    - All things exist through God, but God exists through himself alone.
    - Aseity is the basis for God’s sovereignty and transcendence.
    - "God is the only being who has the ground of his existence in himself." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

3. **Immutability Without Stasis**
    - God does not change in being, purpose, or promise.
    - Immutability is not inertness; God is living and active.
    - God’s covenantal actions do not imply change in his essence.
    - Immutability assures the reliability of God’s word and character.
    - "God is immutable in his being, but not immobile in his activity." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

4. **Impassibility and Divine Affections**
    - God is not subject to involuntary passions or suffering.
    - Impassibility protects God’s transcendence and perfection.
    - Divine affections in Scripture are analogical, not literal passions.
    - God’s love and wrath are expressions of his immutable will, not emotional fluctuations.
    - "God’s impassibility does not mean apathy, but the fullness and constancy of his divine life." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

5. **Creator-Creature Distinction Maintained**
    - God’s attributes set him apart from all created reality.
    - The distinction is necessary to preserve both God’s majesty and his condescension.
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - The incomprehensibility of God is upheld alongside true knowledge of him.
    - "Between the Creator and the creature there is an infinite qualitative difference." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s articulation of **divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility** has deeply influenced Reformed dogmatics, providing a careful balance between classical theism and biblical revelation. His nuanced approach has shaped contemporary discussions on the doctrine of God, especially regarding the relationship between God’s transcendence and immanence. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold the classical attributes of God while remaining faithful to the richness of Scripture.
