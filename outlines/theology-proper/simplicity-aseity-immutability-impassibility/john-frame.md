# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the doctrines of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** with a commitment to classical orthodoxy, yet he reexamines these attributes through his **multiperspectival** method and a strong emphasis on **biblical theology**. He affirms God's transcendence and independence while also stressing the importance of God's covenantal presence and dynamic relationship with creation, sometimes nuancing or critiquing traditional formulations to avoid philosophical abstraction.

- "God’s attributes are not abstract properties, but ways in which he relates to us and rules over his creation." (The Doctrine of God)

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Simplicity as Biblical Coherence**
   - Affirms **divine simplicity** but resists overly philosophical definitions that obscure biblical revelation.
   - God’s attributes are not separable parts but unified in his lordship.
   - Emphasizes that simplicity means God is not composed or divisible.
   - Warns against formulations that undermine God’s personal nature.
   - "God’s simplicity is not a denial of the richness of his character, but an affirmation of his unity." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Aseity as Self-Existence and Independence**
   - God exists **a se**—from himself—and depends on nothing outside himself.
   - Stresses that God’s aseity is foundational for his **lordship** and sovereignty.
   - Relates aseity to God’s covenantal faithfulness and reliability.
   - Rejects any view that would make God contingent on creation.
   - "God is utterly independent, owing his existence and character to nothing outside himself." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Immutability as Faithful Consistency**
   - Affirms that God is **unchanging** in his being, purposes, and promises.
   - Distinguishes between God’s unchangeable character and his dynamic actions in history.
   - Argues that biblical immutability is not static but covenantally reliable.
   - Critiques philosophical immutability that denies God’s real interaction with creation.
   - "God’s immutability is not a lack of relationship, but the guarantee of his faithfulness." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Impassibility Reconsidered**
   - Recognizes the classical doctrine of **impassibility** but seeks a biblically balanced understanding.
   - Argues that God is not subject to involuntary passions or suffering.
   - Maintains that God genuinely responds to his creatures in history.
   - Rejects any view that would make God emotionally detached or unfeeling.
   - "God’s impassibility means he is never overwhelmed, but it does not mean he is indifferent." (No Other God)

5. **Multiperspectival Approach to Divine Attributes**
   - Applies his **multiperspectivalism** to understand God’s attributes from normative, situational, and existential perspectives.
   - Sees each attribute as interrelated and mutually interpreting.
   - Emphasizes the practical and covenantal implications of divine attributes.
   - Seeks to avoid both philosophical abstraction and reductionistic biblicism.
   - "We must always seek to understand God’s attributes as Scripture presents them, in the context of his lordship over us." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame has significantly influenced contemporary **Reformed theology** by challenging theologians to root doctrines like simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility in the **biblical narrative** rather than in abstract philosophical categories. His **multiperspectival** method has encouraged a more integrated and practical approach to the doctrine of God. Frame’s work has sparked ongoing debates about the relationship between classical theism and biblical revelation, shaping discussions in both academic and pastoral contexts.
