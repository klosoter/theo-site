# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg critically reinterpreted the classical **attributes of God**—including **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**—in light of his commitment to the **historicity of revelation** and the dynamic nature of God's relationship with the world. He challenged traditional metaphysical formulations, arguing that the biblical God is not static but is revealed in the unfolding of **history** and is genuinely affected by creation. For Pannenberg, God's self-revelation in **Jesus Christ** and the eschatological consummation are central to understanding divine attributes.

- "God’s deity is his rule over the world, and this rule is not a static possession but is realized in the history of the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (1991)
- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Theology and the Philosophy of Science (1976)
- Basic Questions in Theology (1970–1973)
- Revelation as History (1968, ed. with R. E. C. Browne)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Absolute Simplicity**
    - Argues that the classical doctrine of **simplicity** is too closely tied to Greek metaphysics.
    - Emphasizes that God’s unity is dynamic and eschatologically revealed, not a static oneness.
    - Maintains that God’s identity is constituted in relation to history and the world.
    - Suggests that God’s being is not abstract but is revealed in the plurality of divine actions.
    - "God’s unity is not an abstract simplicity but the unity of his self-realization in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Aseity Reconceived through Relationality**
    - Affirms that God’s **aseity** means self-sufficiency, but not isolation from creation.
    - God’s being is open to the world and is realized in relation to creation.
    - Divine self-existence is compatible with genuine engagement with history.
    - God’s freedom includes the freedom to be affected by the world without being dependent.
    - "God’s self-sufficiency is not threatened but fulfilled in his relationship to the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Immutability as Faithfulness, Not Static Unchangeability**
    - Critiques the classical notion of **immutability** as incompatible with biblical revelation.
    - Proposes that God’s immutability is best understood as **faithfulness** to promises.
    - God’s constancy is seen in his steadfast purpose, not in metaphysical unchangeability.
    - Divine responsiveness does not compromise God’s reliability or deity.
    - "God is unchangeable in his faithfulness, not in the sense of being unaffected by the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Qualified Impassibility**
    - Rejects the idea that God is completely **impassible** and unaffected by creation.
    - Argues that the God revealed in Christ suffers with and for humanity.
    - Divine love entails the capacity to be affected by the suffering of the world.
    - God’s openness to suffering is a sign of strength, not weakness.
    - "The God who is love cannot be impassible in the sense of being incapable of suffering." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Eschatological Realization of Divine Attributes**
    - Asserts that the fullness of God’s attributes is revealed eschatologically.
    - God’s being and attributes are not timelessly given but are disclosed in the consummation of history.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the proleptic revelation of God’s identity and attributes.
    - Divine perfection is future-oriented, realized in the completion of God’s purposes.
    - "Only at the end will God’s deity be manifest in its fullness." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s reconfiguration of **divine attributes** has significantly influenced contemporary theology, especially in debates over the compatibility of classical theism with biblical revelation. His emphasis on the **historicity of God’s self-revelation** and the eschatological orientation of theology has encouraged a more dynamic and relational understanding of God. While some critics argue that he departs too far from traditional doctrines, his work remains a touchstone for those seeking to articulate divine transcendence and immanence in a post-metaphysical context.
