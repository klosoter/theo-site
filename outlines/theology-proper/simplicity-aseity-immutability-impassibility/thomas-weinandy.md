# Thomas Weinandy (1946– )

Thomas Weinandy is a contemporary Roman Catholic theologian known for his vigorous defense of the **classical doctrine of God**, especially the attributes of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. He argues that these divine perfections are essential for a proper understanding of **God’s transcendence** and for maintaining the integrity of **Trinitarian theology** in the face of modern revisionist trends.

- "If God is truly God, then he must be simple, immutable, impassible, and eternal." (Does God Suffer?)

## Key Works

- Does God Suffer? (2000)
- Does God Change? The Word’s Becoming in the Incarnation (1985)
- Does God Feel Our Pain? Theological and Pastoral Perspectives (2000)
- The Father’s Spirit of Sonship: Reconceiving the Trinity (1995)
- “The Immutability of the God Who Suffers” (Theological Studies, 1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity is Foundational**
    - God is not composed of parts, properties, or potentialities.
    - Simplicity ensures that God’s attributes are identical with his essence.
    - Rejects any notion that God’s being is a composite or aggregate.
    - Upholds simplicity as necessary for true **divine transcendence**.
    "God is not a being who possesses goodness, but is Goodness itself." (Does God Suffer?)

2. **Aseity as God’s Self-Existence**
    - God exists entirely from himself and depends on nothing outside himself.
    - Aseity grounds God’s independence from creation.
    - Affirms that God’s life, knowledge, and will are not conditioned by the world.
    - Aseity is inseparable from simplicity and immutability.
    "God is the one who is wholly self-sufficient, who exists from himself and for himself." (Does God Suffer?)

3. **Immutability as Divine Perfection**
    - God does not change in being, character, or purpose.
    - Change would imply imperfection or potentiality in God.
    - Immutability secures the reliability of God’s promises and actions.
    - Distinguishes between God’s unchanging nature and his dynamic relationship with creation.
    "God’s immutability is not a static immobility but the fullness of perfect being." (Does God Suffer?)

4. **Impassibility and Divine Love**
    - God does not suffer emotional fluctuations or be affected by creation.
    - Impassibility protects God’s freedom and sovereignty.
    - God’s love is not diminished by impassibility; rather, it is perfect and unwavering.
    - Rejects the idea that God’s compassion requires passibility.
    "God’s impassibility is the ground of his perfect, unwavering love." (Does God Suffer?)

5. **Incarnation and the Classical Attributes**
    - The Word’s assumption of human nature does not compromise divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, or impassibility.
    - Christ’s suffering is experienced in his human nature, not in the divine nature.
    - The communication of idioms (communicatio idiomatum) preserves the distinction between natures.
    - The Incarnation reveals, rather than negates, the classical attributes of God.
    "The suffering of Christ is the suffering of the Word made flesh, not the suffering of the divine nature as such." (Does God Suffer?)

## Legacy and Impact

Weinandy’s work has been pivotal in the modern retrieval of the **classical doctrine of God**, especially among those seeking to uphold the integrity of **divine attributes** in contemporary theology. His rigorous defense of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** has influenced both Catholic and Protestant discussions, providing a robust response to trends that seek to revise or abandon these doctrines. Weinandy’s scholarship continues to shape debates on how the **Incarnation** relates to the unchanging nature of God.
