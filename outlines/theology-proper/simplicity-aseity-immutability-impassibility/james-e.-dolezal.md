# James Dolezal (1979–)

James Dolezal is a contemporary Reformed theologian who staunchly defends the **doctrine of divine simplicity** and its corollaries: **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. He critiques modern revisions of classical theism, insisting that God is **pure act** and utterly free from composition, change, or dependence on anything outside Himself.

- "God is not composed of parts, nor is he in any way dependent upon what is not God in order to be God." ("All That Is in God," p. 40)

## Key Works

- All That Is in God: Evangelical Theology and the Challenge of Classical Christian Theism (2017)
- God without Parts: Divine Simplicity and the Metaphysics of God's Absoluteness (2011)
- "Simplicity, Aseity, and the Evangelical Crisis" (in The Doctrine of God: Explorations in Constructive Dogmatics, 2016)
- "Classical Theism, Classical Christian Theism, and the Importance of God’s Simplicity" (Themelios, 2019)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity is Foundational**
   - God is not composed of parts, properties, or attributes that are more basic than His essence.
   - All of God's attributes are identical with His essence and with each other in God.
   - Simplicity safeguards the unity and ultimacy of God's being.
   - Any denial of simplicity leads to a mutable or dependent deity.
   - "To deny simplicity is to compromise the very absoluteness of God’s being." (All That Is in God, p. 45)

2. **Aseity as Absolute Independence**
   - God exists entirely from Himself, owing nothing to anything outside Himself.
   - Divine aseity means God’s being and attributes are not derived or caused.
   - Aseity undergirds God’s sovereignty and self-sufficiency.
   - Any form of dependence would compromise God’s ultimacy.
   - "God is not the effect of any cause, nor is he actualized by anything other than himself." (God without Parts, p. 99)

3. **Immutability as Unchangeableness**
   - God cannot undergo any change in being, will, or emotion.
   - Immutability is a necessary consequence of simplicity and aseity.
   - Change would imply potentiality, which is incompatible with God’s pure actuality.
   - God’s promises and purposes are utterly reliable because He does not change.
   - "If God were mutable, he would be less than fully actual and thus less than God." (All That Is in God, p. 67)

4. **Impassibility as Freedom from Passion**
   - God does not experience emotional changes or suffering caused by creatures.
   - Impassibility follows from immutability and simplicity.
   - God’s love and wrath are not passions but perfections of His simple essence.
   - Affirming impassibility preserves God’s transcendence and independence.
   - "God’s impassibility is not indifference but the perfection of his immutable love and justice." (All That Is in God, p. 109)

5. **Critique of Theistic Mutualism**
   - Dolezal rejects views that posit real relational change or dependence in God.
   - Theistic mutualism undermines classical attributes by introducing composition and contingency.
   - He warns that mutualist revisions lead to a diminished, temporalized deity.
   - True worship requires affirming God’s absolute otherness and perfection.
   - "The God of theistic mutualism is not the God of classical Christian theism." (All That Is in God, p. 23)

## Legacy and Impact

James Dolezal has become a leading voice in the **recovery of classical theism** among Reformed and evangelical theologians. His rigorous defense of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** has sparked renewed debate about the doctrine of God in contemporary theology. Dolezal’s work challenges modern trends that compromise divine transcendence, urging a return to the historic confessional understanding of God’s absolute perfection. His influence is evident in both academic and ecclesial discussions on the nature of God.
