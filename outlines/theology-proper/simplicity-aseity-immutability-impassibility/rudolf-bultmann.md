# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the doctrines of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** through the lens of existential interpretation and **demythologization**. He regarded traditional metaphysical attributes of God as products of ancient worldviews, emphasizing instead the **encounter with God** in existential faith rather than in abstract ontological categories. For Bultmann, the significance of God’s attributes lies in their existential meaning for the believer, not in their philosophical formulation.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Divine Attributes**
    - Traditional attributes like **simplicity** and **immutability** are seen as mythological projections.
    - Bultmann seeks to reinterpret these concepts existentially, focusing on their meaning for faith.
    - He rejects metaphysical speculation in favor of existential encounter with God.
    - The language of divine attributes is meaningful only as it relates to human existence.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation over Metaphysics**
    - The reality of God is encountered in personal decision, not in abstract attributes.
    - **Aseity** and **impassibility** are not affirmed as ontological properties but as existential realities.
    - The focus is on the individual's response to the call of God in the present.
    - Theological language must be reinterpreted to speak to modern existential concerns.
    - "Faith is the abandonment of every attempt to justify oneself by means of one's own achievements." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Static Divine Immutability**
    - Bultmann critiques the idea of God as unchangeable in a metaphysical sense.
    - He emphasizes the dynamic, relational nature of God’s interaction with humanity.
    - Immutability is meaningful only as God’s faithfulness in relationship, not as ontological stasis.
    - The biblical witness is prioritized over philosophical categories.
    - "God is not a thing or substance but the power that encounters man in his existence." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **God’s Transcendence as Existential Encounter**
    - **Aseity** is understood as God’s radical otherness, not as self-sufficient substance.
    - God’s transcendence is experienced in the call to authentic existence.
    - The divine is not accessible through human categories but through existential response.
    - The focus is on the event of revelation, not on divine attributes as such.
    - "God reveals himself only in the event of the word." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Impassibility Reinterpreted through the Cross**
    - Bultmann rejects classical impassibility as incompatible with the biblical narrative.
    - The cross reveals God’s involvement and suffering with humanity.
    - Divine impassibility is seen as a mythological concept needing existential reinterpretation.
    - God’s love and engagement are central, not metaphysical detachment.
    - "The cross is the event in which God is revealed as the one who gives himself for man." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **divine attributes** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, challenging traditional metaphysical formulations and prompting widespread debate about the relevance of classical doctrines. His method of **demythologization** influenced both biblical studies and systematic theology, encouraging theologians to reconsider how doctrines like **simplicity** and **immutability** function in contemporary faith. While often criticized by confessional traditions, Bultmann’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between faith, history, and modernity.
