# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a staunch defender of the **classical doctrine of God**, emphasizing the **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** of the divine nature. He argued that these attributes are essential for maintaining the absolute **sovereignty** and **self-sufficiency** of God, and he consistently opposed any theological trends that would compromise the **unchangeableness** or **perfection** of God’s being.

- "God is all that He is in every moment of His existence, and nothing that He is not." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "Biblical and Theological Studies" (especially essays on the doctrine of God)
- "The Person and Work of Christ"
- "Calvin and Calvinism"
- "The Idea of Systematic Theology"
- "Revelation and Inspiration"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity is Foundational**
    - God is not composed of parts; His attributes are identical with His essence.
    - Simplicity safeguards the unity and indivisibility of the divine nature.
    - Rejects any notion that God’s attributes are separable or in tension.
    - Upholds that all of God’s perfections are fully present in every act.
    - "The attributes of God are not so many qualities distinct from His essence, but are that very essence itself presented in its different aspects." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

2. **Aseity as Absolute Self-Existence**
    - God exists from Himself and depends on nothing outside Himself.
    - Aseity undergirds God’s independence from creation and history.
    - Affirms that God’s being and life are wholly self-derived.
    - Any denial of aseity undermines divine sovereignty.
    - "God is the only being who is absolutely self-existent, owing His existence to no one and nothing." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

3. **Immutability as Unchangeableness**
    - God does not change in His essence, purposes, or promises.
    - Immutability is necessary for trust in God’s faithfulness and reliability.
    - Change in God would imply imperfection or dependence.
    - Scripture’s anthropomorphic language must be interpreted analogically.
    - "With Him there is no variableness, neither shadow that is cast by turning." (James 1:17, cited in Biblical and Theological Studies)

4. **Impassibility as Divine Inviolability**
    - God is not subject to suffering or emotional fluctuation as creatures are.
    - Impassibility protects the perfection and blessedness of God.
    - Divine love and wrath are real but not passions that disturb God’s being.
    - Warfield distinguishes between God’s covenantal actions and His essential nature.
    - "God’s impassibility is not indifference, but the guarantee of His perfect and constant love." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

5. **Classical Theism and Reformed Orthodoxy**
    - Warfield aligns with the historic Reformed confessions on the doctrine of God.
    - He resists modern revisions that introduce process or relational change in God.
    - Emphasizes continuity with **Calvin** and the **Westminster Standards**.
    - Sees these doctrines as vital for a robust doctrine of **providence** and **redemption**.
    - "The God of the Bible is the God of the Reformed faith: absolute, sovereign, immutable, and impassible." (Calvin and Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s rigorous defense of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians and remains a benchmark for classical theism in the modern era. His work provided a bulwark against the encroachment of liberal theology and process thought, ensuring that the **unchangeable perfection of God** remained central in confessional Protestantism. Warfield’s articulation of these doctrines continues to inform contemporary debates on the nature of God and the boundaries of orthodox Christian theology.
