# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** of God as essential attributes, consistent with the classical Christian tradition. While not systematizing these doctrines as later Reformed theologians did, Luther upheld the absolute **divine transcendence** and **unchangeableness** of God, especially in contrast to all created things, and insisted that God's being is not affected by the world or human actions.

- "God’s essence is unchangeable, and His will is unchangeable, because He Himself is unchangeable." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis
- The Bondage of the Will
- Disputation Against Scholastic Theology
- Large Catechism
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 22: Sermons on the Gospel of St. John

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Simplicity is Affirmed**
    - God is not composed of parts or changeable qualities.
    - Divine attributes are identical with God’s essence.
    - Rejects any notion that God is a composite being.
    - Emphasizes the unity of God’s will and action.
    - "God is sheer being, not a being compounded of many things." (Disputation Against Scholastic Theology)

2. **Aseity as God’s Self-Existence**
    - God exists from Himself and depends on nothing outside Himself.
    - All creatures are contingent, but God alone is necessary.
    - God’s life and being are not derived or sustained by creation.
    - Aseity undergirds God’s absolute sovereignty and freedom.
    - "God is the being who is from Himself, and all things are from Him." (Lectures on Genesis)

3. **Immutability of God’s Essence and Will**
    - God does not change in His being, purposes, or promises.
    - Human perception of change in God is due to our limited understanding.
    - God’s faithfulness is grounded in His unchangeable nature.
    - Immutability distinguishes Creator from creature.
    - "God’s will is unchangeable, because He Himself is unchangeable." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Impassibility: God is Not Subject to Suffering**
    - God cannot be affected by external forces or passions.
    - Divine impassibility preserves God’s transcendence and perfection.
    - Christ’s suffering is according to His human nature, not His divine.
    - God’s mercy and wrath are expressions of His will, not emotional fluctuations.
    - "God in His own nature cannot suffer or be changed." (The Bondage of the Will)

5. **Distinction Between Hidden and Revealed God**
    - God’s essence (deus absconditus) remains inaccessible and unchanged.
    - God reveals Himself (deus revelatus) in Christ and the Word, without compromising His attributes.
    - The distinction safeguards divine simplicity and immutability.
    - Human knowledge of God is always mediated and partial.
    - "We must make a distinction between God as He is in Himself and as He is revealed to us." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s affirmation of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** shaped early Protestant theology and provided continuity with the broader catholic tradition. His distinction between the hidden and revealed God influenced later Lutheran and Reformed thought, especially regarding the limits of human knowledge of God’s essence. While Luther’s Christology introduced new discussions about divine suffering, he maintained the classical attributes in his doctrine of God, ensuring their centrality in confessional Lutheranism.
