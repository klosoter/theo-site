# Richard Muller (1948–)

Richard Muller is a leading scholar of **Reformed scholasticism**, whose work has clarified the historical development and nuanced articulation of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** in post-Reformation theology. He emphasizes the continuity and careful distinctions made by early modern Reformed theologians, showing that these doctrines were not mere repetitions of medieval thought but were critically appropriated and biblically grounded within the **Reformed orthodox** tradition.

- "The doctrine of divine simplicity, as articulated by the Reformed orthodox, is not a speculative abstraction but a necessary implication of the biblical witness to God’s unity and independence." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: The Divine Essence and Attributes
- Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology
- After Calvin: Studies in the Development of a Theological Tradition
- "Divine Simplicity, Aseity, and the Knowledge of God" (in various essays and articles)
- The Unaccommodated Calvin: Studies in the Foundation of a Theological Tradition

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Simplicity as Foundational to Divine Attributes**
   - Asserts that **simplicity** means God is not composed of parts, metaphysical or physical.
   - Emphasizes that all divine attributes are identical with God's essence, not accidental additions.
   - Argues that simplicity safeguards the unity and uniqueness of God.
   - Maintains that simplicity is biblically warranted and not merely a philosophical imposition.
   - "Simplicity is the ontological ground for the unity of the divine attributes." (PRRD, vol. 3)

2. **Aseity as Divine Self-Existence**
   - Teaches that **aseity** denotes God's absolute independence from all else.
   - Connects aseity to God's role as Creator and sustainer of all things.
   - Insists that aseity undergirds God’s freedom and sovereignty.
   - Shows that Reformed orthodox theologians distinguished aseity from pantheism or deism.
   - "Aseity is the affirmation that God is a se, from himself, and not ab alio, from another." (PRRD, vol. 3)

3. **Immutability as Consistency of Divine Being**
   - Holds that **immutability** means God does not change in essence, will, or purpose.
   - Clarifies that immutability is compatible with God’s dynamic relation to creation.
   - Argues that immutability preserves the reliability of God’s promises and actions.
   - Notes that Reformed scholastics nuanced immutability to avoid static conceptions of God.
   - "Immutability is not immobility; it is the constancy of God’s being and purpose." (PRRD, vol. 3)

4. **Impassibility as Freedom from Creaturely Passions**
   - Defines **impassibility** as God’s incapacity to suffer or be overwhelmed by external forces.
   - Explains that impassibility does not deny God’s affections or relational engagement.
   - Shows that impassibility protects divine sovereignty and aseity.
   - Highlights the careful distinctions made by Reformed orthodox to avoid Stoic or Platonic extremes.
   - "Impassibility, rightly understood, is not the absence of affection but the absence of passivity." (PRRD, vol. 3)

5. **Historical and Dogmatic Contextualization**
   - Stresses the importance of reading Reformed doctrines in their historical and confessional context.
   - Argues that Reformed scholastics critically appropriated patristic and medieval sources.
   - Warns against anachronistic readings that impose modern categories on early modern theology.
   - Emphasizes the continuity and development within the **Reformed confessional** tradition.
   - "The Reformed orthodox did not simply repeat medieval dogmatics but reshaped it in light of Scripture and confessional commitments." (After Calvin)

## Legacy and Impact

Muller’s scholarship has profoundly shaped the study of **Reformed orthodoxy**, correcting misconceptions about the doctrines of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** as rigid or unbiblical. His careful historical and theological analysis has restored appreciation for the sophistication and biblical grounding of early modern Reformed theology. Muller's work continues to influence systematic theologians, historians, and confessional traditions seeking to articulate classical theism in continuity with the Reformed heritage.
