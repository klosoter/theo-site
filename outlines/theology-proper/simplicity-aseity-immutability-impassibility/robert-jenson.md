# Robert Jenson (1930–2017)

Robert Jenson reinterpreted the classical **divine attributes**—especially **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**—in light of God's dynamic involvement in history. He challenged traditional metaphysical categories, insisting that God's **identity** is inseparable from His acts, particularly as revealed in the narrative of **Jesus Christ**. For Jenson, the triune God's life is not static but eschatologically open, and the church's confession must reflect this narrative ontology.

- "God is identified by and with the particular plotted sequence of events that make the narrative of Israel and her Christ." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1: The Triune God (1997)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2: The Works of God (1999)
- The Triune Identity: God According to the Gospel (1982)
- "The Bible and the Trinity" in The Triune God (2002)
- Essays in Theology of Culture (1995)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Simplicity Reconceived as Narrative Unity**
    - Rejects classical metaphysical **simplicity** as abstract oneness.
    - Argues that God's unity is the unity of the divine narrative centered in Christ.
    - God's being is not a static substance but the living coherence of Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - Divine simplicity is realized in the unity of God's story, not in metaphysical abstraction.
    - "God’s simplicity is the narrative coherence of his triune identity." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

2. **Aseity as Relational Freedom**
    - Affirms that God is not dependent on creation for His being.
    - Redefines **aseity** as God's freedom to be Himself in relation to the world.
    - God’s self-existence is not isolation but the freedom of triune love.
    - God’s being is constituted by His self-giving, not by withdrawal from history.
    - "God’s aseity is the freedom of his love, not the closure of his being." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

3. **Immutability as Faithfulness, Not Stasis**
    - Rejects immutability as mere unchangeability or impassivity.
    - Defines **immutability** as God’s unwavering faithfulness to His promises.
    - God’s constancy is His reliability in fulfilling His covenant, not metaphysical immobility.
    - God’s being is dynamic, marked by steadfastness in action.
    - "God is immutable because he is faithful, not because he is inert." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

4. **Impassibility as Triune Passion**
    - Critiques the classical doctrine of **impassibility** as incompatible with the cross.
    - Argues that the triune God is capable of genuine passion and suffering in Christ.
    - God’s love entails vulnerability and involvement in the world’s pain.
    - The cross reveals that God’s impassibility is the constancy of His loving purpose, not absence of feeling.
    - "The God who is love must be able to suffer, for love suffers." (The Triune Identity)

5. **Trinitarian Ontology and Eschatological Identity**
    - God’s being is constituted by the **Trinitarian** relations and eschatological fulfillment.
    - The divine attributes must be interpreted through the narrative of Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - God’s identity is open to the future He promises and enacts.
    - The church’s confession of God must be shaped by the biblical story, not Greek metaphysics.
    - "God is the one who will keep his promises; his identity is eschatological." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Jenson’s revisionist approach to the **divine attributes** has profoundly influenced contemporary trinitarian and narrative theology. His insistence that God's being is inseparable from the biblical narrative has challenged classical theism and inspired new explorations of **Trinitarian ontology**. While controversial among traditional Reformed theologians, Jenson’s work has become a touchstone for those seeking to articulate a more Christocentric and historically engaged doctrine of God. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between **God’s transcendence** and His involvement in history.
