# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer critically engaged the classical doctrines of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**, seeking to uphold the transcendence of God while emphasizing His dynamic relationship with creation. He questioned static philosophical formulations, arguing that biblical revelation presents a God who is both wholly other and genuinely involved with His people. Berkouwer’s approach sought to balance **classical theism** with a robust doctrine of **revelation**.

- "The confession of God’s immutability must not lead us to a static concept of God, but must be understood in the light of the living God who reveals Himself." (The Providence of God)

## Key Works

- The Providence of God (De Voorzienigheid Gods)
- The Knowledge of God (De Kennis van God)
- The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth
- Studies in Dogmatics: The Doctrine of God
- General Revelation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Critical Reassessment of Simplicity**
   - Berkouwer questioned the adequacy of traditional **simplicity** as derived from philosophical categories.
   - He argued that simplicity must be interpreted in light of **biblical revelation** rather than metaphysical abstraction.
   - He warned against reducing God to an abstract, undifferentiated being.
   - Berkouwer emphasized the importance of God’s self-revelation in Christ for understanding divine unity.
   - "The simplicity of God is not a mathematical or metaphysical simplicity, but the fullness of His revealed being." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Aseity and Relationality**
   - Berkouwer affirmed God’s **aseity**—His self-existence and independence from creation.
   - He insisted that aseity does not preclude genuine relationship with the world.
   - He critiqued views that make God’s independence incompatible with His covenantal involvement.
   - Berkouwer saw aseity as the ground for God’s faithfulness and reliability.
   - "God’s aseity is not threatened by His relation to the world, but is the very basis for His faithfulness." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Immutability Reconsidered**
   - Berkouwer distinguished between **immutability** as faithfulness and as unchangeability in every respect.
   - He argued that biblical immutability refers to God’s steadfastness, not to a lack of responsiveness.
   - He rejected a static view that would make God incapable of genuine interaction.
   - Berkouwer maintained that God’s promises and purposes remain unshaken, even as He engages with history.
   - "Immutability in Scripture is not the immobility of a statue, but the faithfulness of the living God." (The Providence of God)

4. **Impassibility and Divine Compassion**
   - Berkouwer critiqued the classical doctrine of **impassibility** as potentially undermining God’s compassion.
   - He argued that God’s freedom means He is not subject to suffering, but He is not indifferent or apathetic.
   - He emphasized that the incarnation reveals God’s willingness to enter into human suffering.
   - Berkouwer saw impassibility as compatible with God’s loving involvement in the world.
   - "The confession of God’s impassibility must not obscure the reality of His compassion." (The Doctrine of God)

5. **Primacy of Revelation over Philosophy**
   - Berkouwer insisted that doctrines of God must be shaped by **revelation**, not speculative philosophy.
   - He warned against imposing Greek metaphysical categories onto biblical teaching.
   - He called for a theology that listens to the witness of Scripture regarding God’s attributes.
   - Berkouwer believed that the living God of the Bible cannot be captured by abstract definitions.
   - "The decisive question is not what philosophy says about God, but what God has revealed about Himself." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced critique of **classical theism** influenced later Reformed and evangelical discussions on the doctrine of God. His insistence on the primacy of **revelation** over philosophical abstraction encouraged theologians to revisit the biblical foundations of divine attributes. While some criticized his approach as too accommodating to modern concerns, Berkouwer’s work remains a significant bridge between traditional dogmatics and contemporary theology, shaping ongoing debates about the nature of God’s transcendence and immanence.
