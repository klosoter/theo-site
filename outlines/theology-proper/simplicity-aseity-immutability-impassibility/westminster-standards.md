# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **God's simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility** as foundational to classical Reformed theology. They affirm that God is **infinite, eternal, and unchangeable** in His being and attributes, insisting that He is not composed of parts, is self-existent, and is unaffected by passions or change. These doctrines are woven throughout the confessional documents, shaping the Reformed understanding of the divine nature.

- "There is but one only, living, and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions; immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty..." (Westminster Confession of Faith 2.1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity**
   - God is without parts or composition, affirming His absolute unity.
   - All of God's attributes are identical with His essence.
   - Simplicity safeguards the unity and indivisibility of God.
   - Rejects any division or composition in the divine being.
   - "God is...without body, parts, or passions." (WCF 2.1)

2. **Divine Aseity**
   - God is self-existent and independent of all creation.
   - He has life in and of Himself, owing nothing to anything outside Himself.
   - Aseity undergirds God's sovereignty and sufficiency.
   - All things depend on God, but God depends on nothing.
   - "God hath all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself." (WCF 2.2)

3. **Divine Immutability**
   - God is unchangeable in His being, purposes, and promises.
   - Immutability ensures the reliability and faithfulness of God.
   - God’s perfections and decrees are constant and unwavering.
   - Change is seen as a creaturely property, not applicable to God.
   - "God is...immutable..." (WCF 2.1)

4. **Divine Impassibility**
   - God is not subject to passions or emotional fluctuations.
   - Impassibility protects the transcendence and sovereignty of God.
   - God’s actions are not reactions; He is never overcome by emotion.
   - This doctrine distinguishes the Creator from the creature.
   - "God is...without...passions..." (WCF 2.1)

5. **Theological and Practical Implications**
   - These doctrines ground the assurance of salvation in God’s unchanging nature.
   - They shape the Reformed approach to worship, prayer, and providence.
   - The attributes serve as a bulwark against anthropomorphism.
   - They inform the confessional boundaries of Reformed orthodoxy.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable dependence on him." (WLC Q.5)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed orthodoxy**, providing a confessional anchor for doctrines of God’s simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility. Their formulations have influenced subsequent confessions, catechisms, and systematic theologies within Presbyterian and broader Reformed traditions. The Standards’ articulation of these divine attributes continues to serve as a benchmark for evaluating theological fidelity and remains central in contemporary discussions of classical theism.
