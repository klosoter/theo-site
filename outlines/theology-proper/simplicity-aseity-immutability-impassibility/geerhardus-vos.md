# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos upheld the classical **doctrine of God**, emphasizing **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** as essential to a robust Reformed theology. He argued that these attributes safeguard the Creator-creature distinction and ensure that God remains the absolute, self-sufficient ground of all being, unaffected by creation yet truly relating to it in covenantal history.

- "God is not composite, nor is there in Him any distinction between essence and attributes; He is what He has." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Doctrine of God" (in various lectures and essays)
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus (for implications on divine attributes)
- Selected articles in Princeton Theological Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity is Foundational**
    - God’s being is not composed of parts or attributes; His essence and attributes are identical.
    - Simplicity preserves the unity and indivisibility of God’s nature.
    - Rejects any notion that God’s attributes are separable or in tension.
    - Simplicity undergirds all other divine perfections.
    - "God is not composite, nor is there in Him any distinction between essence and attributes; He is what He has." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Aseity as Absolute Self-Existence**
    - God exists from Himself and depends on nothing outside Himself.
    - Aseity distinguishes the Creator from the creature in the most radical way.
    - All of God’s perfections flow from His self-existence.
    - Aseity is the ground for God’s independence and sovereignty.
    - "God is independent in His being, and all else is dependent upon Him." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Immutability Ensures Divine Faithfulness**
    - God does not change in His being, purposes, or promises.
    - Immutability is not staticness but the perfection of God’s constancy.
    - Change in God would imply imperfection or dependence.
    - Immutability is essential for the reliability of God’s covenant.
    - "God’s immutability is the guarantee of His faithfulness to His covenant people." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

4. **Impassibility Protects Divine Transcendence**
    - God is not subject to involuntary passions or suffering.
    - Impassibility maintains God’s freedom from created limitations.
    - God’s actions in history are voluntary, not reactions to creation.
    - Impassibility is compatible with God’s true relational engagement.
    - "God’s impassibility does not preclude His active involvement in history, but affirms His sovereign initiative." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

5. **Biblical Revelation Affirms Classical Attributes**
    - Vos grounds these attributes in the progressive revelation of Scripture.
    - The Old and New Testaments consistently present God as simple, self-existent, immutable, and impassible.
    - The covenantal relationship does not compromise God’s essential attributes.
    - Biblical theology and systematic theology are mutually reinforcing on the doctrine of God.
    - "The God of revelation is the God of absolute being, who enters into covenant without ceasing to be what He is." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** has profoundly shaped Reformed dogmatics, especially in the Princeton and Westminster traditions. His insistence on grounding these attributes in both systematic and biblical theology has influenced generations of theologians seeking to uphold the classical doctrine of God. Vos’s work remains a touchstone for those defending the transcendence and faithfulness of the God of Scripture.
