# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich reinterpreted the classical attributes of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** through his existential and ontological framework. Rather than affirming these attributes in traditional metaphysical terms, Tillich understood them as symbolic expressions of the **"Ground of Being"** and the **God-world relation**, emphasizing God's dynamic presence and existential significance rather than static perfection.

- "God does not exist. He is being-itself beyond essence and existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as the Ground of Being**
   - God is not a being among beings but **Being-Itself**, transcending all finite categories.
   - The attributes of God, including **simplicity** and **aseity**, are understood symbolically.
   - God’s "simplicity" refers to the unity of the divine life, not metaphysical composition.
   - **Aseity** is reframed as God’s self-sufficiency as the source of all being.
   - "God is the ground of the power of being, present in everything that has being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Rejection of Static Immutability**
   - Tillich critiques classical **immutability** as incompatible with the living God.
   - God is unchangeable in essence but dynamically related to the world.
   - Divine immutability means constancy in love and purpose, not absence of relationality.
   - The God-world relation involves genuine interaction without compromising divine depth.
   - "God is unchangeable in his being, but not in his relation to the creature." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Symbolic Interpretation of Impassibility**
   - **Impassibility** is not literal absence of feeling but points to God’s freedom from creaturely limitation.
   - God participates in the suffering of the world through the **New Being** in Christ.
   - Divine pathos is affirmed: God is affected by and responds to human existence.
   - The classical attribute is retained only as a symbol of God’s transcendence over finite passions.
   - "God is not subject to suffering in a creaturely sense, but he is not without passion." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Dynamic Unity and Divine Simplicity**
   - **Simplicity** is reinterpreted as the dynamic unity of God’s life, not metaphysical indivisibility.
   - God’s attributes are expressions of the one divine life, not separable qualities.
   - The unity of God is existential, rooted in the depth of being.
   - Simplicity is a symbol for the wholeness and integrity of the divine.
   - "The divine life is the unity of depth and movement, of identity and difference." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Existential Aseity and Divine Freedom**
   - **Aseity** is understood as God’s existential independence from the world.
   - God is the source of all being, not dependent on anything outside himself.
   - Divine freedom is the basis for God’s creative and sustaining activity.
   - Aseity is not isolation but the power to participate in and ground all existence.
   - "God’s aseity is his power to be the ground of everything without being conditioned by anything." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s reinterpretation of **divine attributes** profoundly influenced 20th-century theology, especially in existential and process thought. His symbolic and ontological approach challenged traditional metaphysical formulations and opened new avenues for understanding the **God-world relation**. While controversial among classical theists, Tillich’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relevance of classical attributes in modern theology. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of **divine transcendence** and immanence.
