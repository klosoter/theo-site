# K. Scott Oliphint (1955– )

K. Scott Oliphint approaches the doctrines of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** through a distinctly Reformed and covenantal lens, emphasizing the Creator-creature distinction and the implications of **God’s condescension**. He affirms the classical attributes of God while also developing the concept of **covenantal properties** to explain how God relates to creation without compromising His essential nature. Oliphint’s work seeks to uphold the integrity of **divine immutability** and **impassibility** while accounting for God’s genuine interaction with His people in redemptive history.

- "God’s condescension does not entail any change in his essential being, but rather the addition of covenantal properties by which he relates to his creation." (God with Us, p. 73)

- "Simplicity, Triunity, and the Attributes of God" in The Doctrine of God: A Global Introduction (contributor)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity Maintained**
   - God is not composed of parts; His attributes are identical with His essence.
   - Simplicity safeguards the unity and independence of God’s being.
   - God’s simplicity is foundational for understanding all other attributes.
   - Any distinction in God is a distinction of relation, not composition.
   - "God is not a composite being; his attributes are not additions to his essence, but are identical with it." (God with Us, p. 60)

2. **Aseity as Absolute Self-Existence**
   - God exists a se and is dependent on nothing outside Himself.
   - Aseity grounds God’s independence from creation and His sufficiency.
   - The Creator-creature distinction is rooted in God’s aseity.
   - God’s aseity is not compromised by His covenantal actions.
   - "God’s aseity is the foundation for his independence and the source of all that is not God." (God with Us, p. 45)

3. **Immutability and Redemptive History**
   - God’s essential nature does not change, even as He acts in history.
   - Immutability is compatible with God’s dynamic involvement in creation.
   - God’s promises and purposes remain constant.
   - The distinction between God’s eternal being and His covenantal actions is crucial.
   - "God’s immutability means that he is always faithful to his covenant, never changing in his promises or purposes." (God with Us, p. 82)

4. **Impassibility and Covenantal Properties**
   - God is not subject to involuntary passions or suffering.
   - Impassibility protects God’s transcendence and sovereignty.
   - God freely wills to relate to His people without compromising His impassibility.
   - Covenantal properties explain how God can genuinely interact with creation.
   - "God’s impassibility does not mean he is indifferent, but that he is never overwhelmed or changed by creation." (God with Us, p. 90)

5. **Divine Condescension and the Creator-Creature Distinction**
   - God’s condescension is a voluntary act, not a change in essence.
   - Through condescension, God takes on covenantal properties to relate to humanity.
   - This preserves both God’s transcendence and immanence.
   - The Creator-creature distinction is maintained even in God’s nearness.
   - "Divine condescension is the means by which God remains who he is while truly relating to his creation." (God with Us, p. 73)

## Legacy and Impact

Oliphint’s articulation of **covenantal properties** has significantly influenced contemporary Reformed discussions on the doctrine of God, especially regarding how God’s classical attributes relate to His actions in redemptive history. His work provides a robust defense of **divine immutability** and **impassibility** while offering a nuanced account of God’s relational engagement with creation. Oliphint’s approach has shaped theological education and apologetics, particularly within the Westminster tradition, by emphasizing the importance of the Creator-creature distinction and the coherence of Reformed theology.
