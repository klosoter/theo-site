# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirms the **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** of God as essential attributes that distinguish the Creator from the creature. He insists that God is wholly self-sufficient, unchanging, and unaffected by passions, grounding these doctrines in the witness of **Scripture** and the classical Christian tradition. For Calvin, these attributes safeguard the majesty and transcendence of God while ensuring the reliability of His covenant promises.

- "We ought not to seek for a God elsewhere than in his sacred Word, nor to think of him otherwise than as he there describes himself." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, I.xiii.21)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 10–14)
- Commentaries on Genesis and Exodus
- Sermons on Job
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles)
- Calvin’s Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (T.H.L. Parker)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Simplicity**
    - God is not composed of parts or passions; His attributes are identical with His essence.
    - Simplicity ensures that God is not subject to division or change.
    - Calvin rejects any anthropomorphic conception that would compromise divine unity.
    - All divine perfections are fully present in God at all times.
    - "His nature is simple and undivided, and so all his attributes are one in him." (Institutes I.xiii.2)

2. **Aseity of God**
    - God exists from Himself and depends on nothing outside Himself.
    - Aseity undergirds God’s independence and sovereignty over creation.
    - Calvin emphasizes that all created things derive their being from God, but God is self-existent.
    - This attribute distinguishes God absolutely from all creatures.
    - "His essence is self-existent, and hence he is the sole fountain of life." (Institutes I.xiii.19)

3. **Immutability of God**
    - God is unchangeable in His being, purposes, and promises.
    - Immutability assures believers of the constancy of God’s covenant faithfulness.
    - Calvin interprets biblical language of God’s “change” as figurative or accommodating human understanding.
    - God’s immutability is foundational to trust in His Word and works.
    - "God is not subject to any mutations or passions, but remains always like himself." (Institutes I.xvii.13)

4. **Impassibility of God**
    - God is not subject to suffering or emotional fluctuations as creatures are.
    - Calvin affirms that scriptural descriptions of God’s emotions are metaphorical.
    - Impassibility protects the transcendence and perfection of God’s nature.
    - God’s actions in history are expressions of His eternal will, not reactions to external events.
    - "Nothing happens except what is knowingly and willingly decreed by Him." (Institutes I.xvi.3)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Divine Attributes**
    - Calvin grounds all doctrine of God’s attributes in the revelation of **Scripture**.
    - He warns against speculative theology not anchored in biblical testimony.
    - The attributes of simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility are derived from God’s self-disclosure.
    - Calvin insists that true knowledge of God is always analogical and accommodated to human capacity.
    - "Let us remember that a description of God drawn from his works ought to be regulated by the rule of Scripture." (Institutes I.v.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust articulation of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy and confessional standards. His careful exegesis and insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** shaped the doctrine of God for generations, influencing both scholastic and pastoral theology. Calvin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to the transcendence and reliability of God, as well as in contemporary debates over the classical attributes of God.
