# Stephen Charnock (1628–1680)

Stephen Charnock, a prominent Puritan theologian, is renowned for his robust articulation of the **divine attributes**, especially **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. He maintains that God is utterly independent, unchanging, and without composition, grounding these perfections in the unity and perfection of the **divine essence**. Charnock’s theology highlights the necessity of these attributes for a proper understanding of **God’s transcendence**.

- "God is a most simple Being, free from all composition and division." ("The Existence and Attributes of God")

## Key Works

- The Existence and Attributes of God (especially Discourses II–VI)
- A Discourse on the Eternity of God
- A Discourse on the Immutability of God
- A Discourse on God’s Being a Spirit
- The Works of Stephen Charnock (various sermons and treatises on divine attributes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Simplicity is Absolute**
    - God is not composed of parts, qualities, or passions; His essence is indivisible.
    - All attributes are identical with God’s essence, not additions to it.
    - Simplicity safeguards the unity and perfection of God.
    - Complexity would imply potentiality or change, which is impossible for God.
    "God is a most simple Being, free from all composition and division." (The Existence and Attributes of God)

2. **Aseity as Divine Independence**
    - God exists from Himself and depends on nothing outside Himself.
    - All creatures derive their being from God, but God is self-sufficient.
    - Aseity undergirds God’s sovereignty and freedom.
    - The divine will and existence are not conditioned by anything external.
    "He is whatsoever He is by His own will, not by necessity of nature, nor by any extrinsic cause." (The Existence and Attributes of God)

3. **Immutability as Perfection**
    - God cannot change in essence, will, or purpose.
    - Change would imply imperfection or lack, which is incompatible with deity.
    - God’s promises and threats are sure because of His immutability.
    - Immutability is essential for trust in God’s covenant faithfulness.
    "God is unchangeable in His nature, and therefore in His knowledge and will." (The Existence and Attributes of God)

4. **Impassibility and Divine Transcendence**
    - God is not subject to passions or suffering as creatures are.
    - Impassibility protects God’s blessedness and perfection.
    - Scriptural language about God’s emotions is understood analogically.
    - God’s actions in history do not entail internal emotional change.
    "God is not capable of any perturbations from anything in Himself or from without Himself." (The Existence and Attributes of God)

5. **Unity of the Divine Attributes**
    - All attributes are perfectly united in the divine essence.
    - No attribute contradicts or limits another; they are harmoniously one.
    - The attributes are not separate realities but ways of describing God’s one, simple being.
    - This unity ensures the consistency and reliability of God’s character.
    "All the attributes of God are the same with His essence, and are one in Him." (The Existence and Attributes of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Charnock’s rigorous defense of **divine simplicity** and related attributes has profoundly shaped Reformed and Puritan theology. His discourses remain a standard reference for understanding the classical doctrine of God’s nature, especially in discussions of **immutability** and **aseity**. Charnock’s careful distinctions and biblical grounding continue to influence contemporary debates on the doctrine of God, ensuring his ongoing relevance in systematic theology.
