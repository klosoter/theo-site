# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til upheld the **classical attributes of God**—**simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**—as essential to a robustly **Reformed doctrine of God**. He insisted that these attributes must be understood in light of the **Creator-creature distinction**, emphasizing that God’s being is wholly self-sufficient, unchanging, and not subject to the limitations of created existence.

- "God is absolute. He is not correlative to the universe. He is independent of it, while it is dependent upon him." ("The Defense of the Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Simplicity as Incommunicable Uniqueness**
   - God’s **simplicity** means He is not composed of parts or divisible attributes.
   - All of God’s attributes are identical with His essence, not additions to it.
   - Simplicity safeguards the **Creator-creature distinction** by denying all composition in God.
   - Human analogies must not compromise God’s absolute unity.
   - "God is not a being who has existence; he is existence itself." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Aseity as Absolute Self-Existence**
   - God exists **a se**—from Himself—and depends on nothing outside Himself.
   - Aseity undergirds all other divine attributes, especially **independence** and **sovereignty**.
   - The doctrine of aseity is foundational for **presuppositional apologetics**.
   - Any denial of aseity leads to a collapse of the **Creator-creature distinction**.
   - "God is the only self-contained being; all else is dependent upon him." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Immutability as Unchanging Faithfulness**
   - God does not change in His being, purposes, or promises.
   - Immutability is not static but is the perfection of God’s constancy.
   - God’s immutability ensures the reliability of **covenant revelation**.
   - Apparent changes in God are anthropomorphic accommodations to human understanding.
   - "God’s counsel stands forever, and with it, his character remains unchanged." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Impassibility as Freedom from Creaturely Passions**
   - God is not subject to emotional fluctuations or suffering as creatures are.
   - Impassibility protects God’s **sovereignty** and **transcendence**.
   - God’s love and wrath are not passions but perfections of His immutable nature.
   - The incarnation does not compromise divine impassibility; Christ’s suffering is according to His human nature.
   - "God’s impassibility means that he is never the victim of circumstances." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

5. **Creator-Creature Distinction as Interpretive Key**
   - All divine attributes must be understood analogically, not univocally.
   - The **incommunicable attributes** highlight God’s absolute otherness from creation.
   - Human knowledge of God is always **ectypal**, never archetypal.
   - The distinction prevents projection of creaturely limitations onto God.
   - "We must always maintain the distinction between God’s knowledge and ours, lest we make him a creature." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in the area of **presuppositional apologetics**. His insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction** remains a hallmark of confessional Reformed thought. While some have critiqued his analogical approach as overly apophatic, Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing defense of classical theism within the Reformed tradition.
