# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner, a leading figure in **dialectical theology**, critically reinterpreted the classical **attributes of God** such as **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. Brunner rejected a static, metaphysical conception of God, emphasizing instead the dynamic and relational nature of the divine, especially as revealed in **Jesus Christ**. He argued that traditional formulations risked abstracting God from genuine personal encounter.

- "The God of the Bible is not the unmoved mover of the philosophers, but the living God who acts and enters into relationship with man." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. I)
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Truth as Encounter
- The Divine-Human Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Absolute Simplicity**
    - Brunner critiques the classical doctrine of **simplicity** as overly influenced by Greek metaphysics.
    - He argues that God's being is not abstract unity but personal and relational.
    - Divine unity is maintained, but not at the expense of God's capacity for self-differentiation in revelation.
    - The biblical God is not a metaphysical abstraction but the living Lord.
    - "The God of the Bible is not a mathematical point, but the living God who reveals Himself." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Aseity as Relational Independence**
    - Brunner affirms God's **aseity** as self-existence, but insists this does not preclude genuine relationship.
    - God is independent of the world, yet freely chooses to relate to humanity.
    - Divine self-sufficiency is compatible with God's loving initiative.
    - God's freedom is not compromised by entering into covenant.
    - "God is free to be for us without ceasing to be Himself." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

3. **Dynamic Immutability**
    - Brunner redefines **immutability** as faithfulness rather than metaphysical unchangeability.
    - God’s character and promises are unchanging, but God is dynamically involved in history.
    - The biblical witness portrays God as responsive and engaged.
    - Immutability must be understood in light of God’s living action, not static being.
    - "God is unchangeable in His faithfulness, not in the sense of being unmoved." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

4. **Qualified Impassibility**
    - Brunner rejects the notion that God is incapable of suffering or emotion.
    - He insists that God’s love entails genuine pathos and involvement with human suffering.
    - The cross of Christ reveals a God who is affected by and responds to human need.
    - Divine impassibility, if affirmed, must be compatible with God’s compassion.
    - "The God who cannot suffer is not the God of the Bible." (The Mediator)

5. **Christocentric Revision of Divine Attributes**
    - Brunner insists that all divine attributes must be interpreted through the revelation in **Jesus Christ**.
    - The person and work of Christ reveal the true meaning of God’s being and action.
    - Classical attributes are re-evaluated in light of the incarnation and atonement.
    - The living encounter with Christ corrects abstract theological speculation.
    - "We must learn to think of God from Christ, not from metaphysics." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s reinterpretation of **divine attributes** significantly influenced 20th-century Protestant theology, challenging classical theism’s reliance on philosophical categories. His emphasis on the **relational and dynamic** character of God contributed to ongoing debates about the compatibility of **immutability** and **impassibility** with biblical revelation. Brunner’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to articulate a doctrine of God rooted in **Christocentric** and existential encounter rather than abstract metaphysics.
