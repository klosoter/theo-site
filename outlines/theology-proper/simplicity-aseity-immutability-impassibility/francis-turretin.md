# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure of **Reformed scholasticism**, robustly defended the classical doctrines of **divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility**. He argued that God’s being is utterly uncompounded, self-existent, unchangeable, and unaffected by creaturely passions, grounding these attributes in the necessity and perfection of the divine nature. Turretin’s approach is marked by careful distinctions and a strong commitment to the **immutability** and **transcendence** of God.

- "God is simple because he is not composed of parts, whether physical, logical, or metaphysical." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, III.5.2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity is Absolute**
    - God is not composed of parts, properties, or accidents.
    - Simplicity safeguards the unity and indivisibility of the divine essence.
    - All divine attributes are identical with God’s essence, not additions to it.
    - Simplicity excludes any real distinction between essence and attributes in God.
    - "Simplicity excludes all composition, whether of act and potency, substance and accident, or genus and difference." (Institutes, III.5.3)

2. **Aseity as Self-Existence**
    - God exists from himself and depends on nothing outside himself.
    - Aseity is the foundation for God’s independence and sufficiency.
    - All that is in God is of God; he is the source of his own being and attributes.
    - Aseity distinguishes the Creator from all creatures, who are contingent.
    - "God is by nature, not by participation, and is the first and most perfect being." (Institutes, III.7.1)

3. **Immutability of God’s Essence and Will**
    - God cannot change in being, purpose, or promise.
    - Immutability is necessary for God’s perfection and faithfulness.
    - Apparent changes in God are due to changes in creatures, not in God himself.
    - Immutability is compatible with God’s free actions in time.
    - "God is immutable because he is pure act, without any potentiality to change." (Institutes, III.11.2)

4. **Impassibility as Freedom from Creaturely Passions**
    - God does not experience emotional fluctuations or suffering as creatures do.
    - Impassibility protects the perfection and blessedness of God.
    - Scriptural attributions of emotion to God are understood anthropopathically.
    - God’s actions in history are expressions of his eternal will, not reactions.
    - "God is said to be impassible because he cannot be affected by anything outside himself." (Institutes, III.11.6)

5. **Transcendence and Incomprehensibility**
    - God’s essence and attributes transcend all created categories.
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - The incomprehensibility of God is consistent with true knowledge of him.
    - Divine transcendence undergirds all other divine perfections.
    - "The finite cannot comprehend the infinite, yet God is truly known as he reveals himself." (Institutes, III.4.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of **divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility** became a standard for later Reformed orthodoxy and shaped confessional theology in the post-Reformation era. His distinctions and arguments provided a bulwark against both Socinian and Arminian challenges to the classical doctrine of God. Turretin’s influence endures in the systematic formulations of the Westminster tradition and in contemporary discussions of the doctrine of God. His work remains a touchstone for those defending the classical attributes of God within the Reformed tradition.
