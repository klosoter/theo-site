# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulates a classical doctrine of **divine simplicity**, asserting that God is without composition, fully **aseity** (self-existence), and characterized by **immutability** and **impassibility**. For Aquinas, these attributes are interrelated and essential to a proper understanding of the **divine nature**, ensuring that God is utterly distinct from all created being and unaffected by change or passion.

- "God is altogether simple, for in Him there is no composition, neither of quantitative parts nor, as it were, of form and matter." (Summa Theologiae I, q.3, a.7)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially Part I, Questions 3, 9, 10
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book I, chapters 15–23
- De Potentia Dei
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- The Oxford Handbook of Aquinas (ed. Davies & Stump, secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity**
    - God is not composed of parts, properties, or potentiality and actuality; He is pure act (**actus purus**).
    - All attributes of God (e.g., goodness, wisdom, power) are identical with His essence.
    - Simplicity is necessary to avoid any contingency or dependence in God.
    - Simplicity undergirds all other divine attributes, ensuring unity and perfection.
    - "In God, essence and existence are the same." (Summa Theologiae I, q.3, a.4)

2. **Aseity (Self-Existence)**
    - God exists by necessity of His own nature, not derived from anything else.
    - All other beings participate in existence, but God is existence itself (**ipsum esse subsistens**).
    - Aseity excludes any potentiality or dependence in God.
    - This attribute grounds God's absolute sovereignty and independence.
    - "God is His own existence, and not merely a possessor of existence." (Summa Contra Gentiles I, ch.22)

3. **Immutability**
    - God is unchangeable in being, will, and purpose.
    - Change implies potentiality, but God is pure actuality.
    - Immutability is required for God's perfection and faithfulness.
    - All change in creatures presupposes an unchanging cause.
    - "God is altogether immutable." (Summa Theologiae I, q.9, a.1)

4. **Impassibility**
    - God does not undergo emotional changes or sufferings as creatures do.
    - Passions imply change and dependence, which are incompatible with the divine nature.
    - Scriptural language about God’s emotions is understood analogically, not univocally.
    - Impassibility preserves God's transcendence and sovereignty over creation.
    - "In God there are no passions." (Summa Theologiae I, q.20, a.1)

5. **Analogy and Divine Attributes**
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - Divine attributes are not distinct realities in God but reflect our limited understanding.
    - Analogy safeguards both divine transcendence and meaningful theological discourse.
    - This approach avoids both anthropomorphism and agnosticism about God.
    - "We cannot know what God is, but only what He is not." (Summa Contra Gentiles I, ch.30)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s robust articulation of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** has profoundly shaped both Roman Catholic and Protestant scholastic theology. His synthesis of **Aristotelian philosophy** and Christian doctrine provided a systematic framework for understanding the divine attributes that remains influential in contemporary debates. Aquinas’s careful distinctions and analogical approach continue to inform discussions on the nature of God, especially in the context of classical theism.
