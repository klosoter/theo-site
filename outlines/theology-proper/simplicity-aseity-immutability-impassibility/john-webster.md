# John Webster (1955–2016)

John Webster was a leading contemporary theologian who robustly defended the **classical doctrine of God**, especially the attributes of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. He argued that these divine perfections are essential to a proper understanding of **God’s holiness** and transcendence, and he critiqued modern revisions that compromise the Creator-creature distinction. Webster insisted that these attributes safeguard the **uniqueness** and **self-sufficiency** of God, grounding all theological reflection in the divine being.

- "The perfection of God is the ground of all his works, not their product." (God Without Measure, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- God Without Measure: Working Papers in Christian Theology, Vol. 1: God and the Works of God
- Holiness
- "Trinity and Creation" (International Journal of Systematic Theology, 2005)
- "The Immutable and Impassible God" (in Engaging the Doctrine of God, ed. Bruce L. McCormack)
- "Simplicity, Self-Relatedness and the Task of Dogmatics" (in The Providence of God: Deus Habet Consilium)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity as Foundational**
    - God is not composed of parts; his attributes are identical with his essence.
    - Simplicity ensures that God’s being is not contingent or divisible.
    - Rejects modern tendencies to psychologize or historicize God’s nature.
    - Upholds simplicity as essential to the **unity** and **perfection** of God.
    - "Simplicity is the grammar of the doctrine of God." (God Without Measure, Vol. 1)

2. **Aseity and Divine Self-Sufficiency**
    - God exists a se—of himself—and is not dependent on anything outside himself.
    - Aseity grounds God’s absolute freedom and sovereignty.
    - Affirms that God’s life is not conditioned by creation or history.
    - Aseity is the basis for true **theological ontology**.
    - "God is not constituted by his relation to the world, but is antecedently perfect." (God Without Measure, Vol. 1)

3. **Immutability as Perfection**
    - God is unchanging in his being, purposes, and promises.
    - Immutability is not inertness but the fullness of divine life.
    - Rejects views that make God’s being reactive or processual.
    - Immutability is necessary for God’s faithfulness and trustworthiness.
    - "God’s immutability is the stability of his holy love." (Holiness)

4. **Impassibility and Divine Freedom**
    - God is not subject to suffering or emotional fluctuation as creatures are.
    - Impassibility protects God’s freedom from being overwhelmed by the world.
    - Affirms that God’s love is active and sovereign, not passive or needy.
    - Impassibility is compatible with God’s relational engagement with creation.
    - "Impassibility is not indifference, but the mode of God’s pure and active love." ("The Immutable and Impassible God")

5. **Holiness as the Context for Divine Attributes**
    - God’s holiness sets the context for understanding all divine perfections.
    - Holiness marks the Creator-creature distinction and God’s utter otherness.
    - The attributes of simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility express God’s holy being.
    - Holiness demands that theology begin with God’s self-revelation, not human experience.
    - "The holiness of God is the radiant fullness of his being as the one who is utterly unique." (Holiness)

## Legacy and Impact

Webster’s retrieval of the **classical doctrine of God** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed and catholic theology, especially in debates over divine attributes. His rigorous defense of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** has challenged revisionist trends and re-centered the transcendence and holiness of God in systematic theology. Webster’s work continues to inspire theologians to uphold the Creator-creature distinction and to ground all doctrine in the perfection of God’s being.
