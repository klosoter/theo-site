# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **God** is foundational for Western theology, emphasizing the divine attributes of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. He insists that God is utterly unlike creation: God is not composed of parts, is self-existent, unchanging, and unaffected by passions, grounding these convictions in both philosophical reasoning and biblical exegesis.

- "God is truly and absolutely simple, and therefore unchangeable." (On the Trinity, VI.7.8)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- Enchiridion
- Letters (especially correspondence with Evodius and Simplicianus)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity**
    - God is not composed of parts, qualities, or accidents.
    - All of God’s attributes are identical with His essence.
    - Simplicity ensures that God is not subject to division or change.
    - Any multiplicity in God is only apparent, not real.
    - "For what is simple has nothing in it that is not itself." (De Trinitate, VI.7.8)

2. **Aseity (Self-Existence)**
    - God exists from Himself and depends on nothing outside Himself.
    - All created things derive their being from God, who alone is necessary.
    - God’s being is His essence; He is “He Who Is.”
    - Aseity undergirds God’s independence and sufficiency.
    - "For God is, and He is as He is, because He is unchangeable." (De Trinitate, V.2.3)

3. **Immutability**
    - God cannot change in being, will, or purpose.
    - Change implies imperfection, which cannot be attributed to God.
    - God’s immutability is the ground of His faithfulness and reliability.
    - All change belongs to the created order, not to the Creator.
    - "Whatever is changed is not truly eternal; but our God is eternal, and therefore unchangeable." (City of God, XI.10)

4. **Impassibility**
    - God does not suffer or undergo emotional fluctuations.
    - Scriptural language about God’s emotions is metaphorical or anthropopathic.
    - Impassibility safeguards God’s perfection and transcendence.
    - God’s actions in history are expressions of His unchanging will, not reactions.
    - "The emotions ascribed to God are not passions but effects of His immutable will." (City of God, IX.5)

5. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God’s attributes set Him apart absolutely from all creatures.
    - The Creator is simple, immutable, and impassible; creatures are composite, mutable, and passible.
    - Divine transcendence is maintained without denying God’s immanence.
    - The distinction is essential for true worship and theology.
    - "Between Creator and creature there is a vast difference, for He is unchangeable, but they are changeable." (Confessions, I.4)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** became normative for both medieval and Reformation theology, profoundly shaping the Western understanding of God. His influence is evident in the writings of Aquinas, the Reformers, and the confessional standards of the Reformed tradition. Augustine’s careful distinction between Creator and creature continues to inform contemporary debates on the doctrine of God, ensuring that his legacy remains central to systematic theology.
