# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in twentieth-century **Reformed theology**, upheld the classical doctrines of **divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility** as essential to a biblical doctrine of God. He emphasized that these attributes safeguard the Creator-creature distinction and the absolute **self-sufficiency** and **unchangeableness** of God, while also carefully articulating how God’s relational dealings with creation do not compromise His essential nature.

- "God is independent of all things other than himself, and all other things depend upon him." ("Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2")

## Key Works

- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (especially theological excursuses)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "Principles of Conduct"
- "Calvin on the Sovereignty of God and Reprobation" (essay)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity is Foundational**
    - God is not composed of parts or attributes; His being is identical with His attributes.
    - Simplicity ensures that God’s attributes are not in tension or competition.
    - Upholds the unity of God’s essence against all forms of division or composition.
    - Affirms that all God’s perfections are fully present in every divine act.
    - "God is not a composite being; his attributes are not something superadded to his essence." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Aseity as Absolute Self-Existence**
    - God exists from Himself and is dependent on nothing outside Himself.
    - Aseity undergirds God’s independence in will, purpose, and action.
    - All creation is utterly contingent upon God’s sustaining will.
    - Aseity is the basis for God’s sovereignty and lordship over all.
    - "The self-existence of God means that he is not derived from nor dependent upon anything other than himself." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Immutability as Unchangeableness**
    - God does not change in His being, purposes, or promises.
    - Immutability is essential for the reliability of God’s covenant faithfulness.
    - God’s interactions with creation do not entail internal change.
    - Scriptural language of God “repenting” or “relenting” is anthropopathic, not literal.
    - "There is no change in God, no variableness nor shadow cast by turning." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Impassibility Properly Defined**
    - God is not subject to passions or suffering as creatures are.
    - Impassibility protects God’s transcendence and freedom from external compulsion.
    - God’s love, wrath, and mercy are expressions of His immutable will, not emotional fluctuations.
    - The incarnation is unique: in Christ, God the Son assumes suffering without compromising divine impassibility.
    - "God’s impassibility does not mean that he is devoid of affection, but that he is not subject to involuntary passions." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Creator-Creature Distinction Maintained**
    - These attributes distinguish God absolutely from His creation.
    - God’s covenantal condescension does not entail a change in His essence.
    - Theological language must respect the infinite qualitative distinction between God and creatures.
    - The mystery of God’s being requires humility and reverence in doctrinal formulation.
    - "We must ever remember the infinite distance between the Creator and the creature." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of **divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. His insistence on the Creator-creature distinction and the unchanging character of God remains influential in contemporary discussions of classical theism. Murray’s legacy endures in his commitment to biblical fidelity and theological precision, providing a robust framework for understanding the doctrine of God in relation to redemptive history.
