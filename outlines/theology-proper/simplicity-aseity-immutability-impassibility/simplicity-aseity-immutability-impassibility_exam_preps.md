### TITLE
Classical Immutability and Impassibility as the Grammar of Aseity and Simplicity

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether and how **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** cohere as a single classical doctrine of God compatible with Scripture, covenantal relationality, and the incarnation.  
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Herman Bavinck, Jürgen Moltmann.  
- Relevant traditions: Patristic and medieval **classical theism**, Reformed scholastic and confessional theology, selected strands of modern theology as critical alternatives.  
- Debates: Internal debates over modes of predication, real relations, and Reformed reception of scholastic metaphysics; external debates with process and personalist theologies that deny strong **immutability** and **impassibility**; contemporary debates on divine emotions, the cross, and relational ontology.  
- Defended position: A robust classical theism that affirms strong **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and qualified **impassibility**, maintaining that God is pure act, without passive potency or composition, and that biblical depictions of divine change and suffering are to be read through **analogical knowledge** of God, not univocally.

### ESSAY
The divine attributes of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** stand or fall together as an integrated account of who the biblical God must be if he is the Creator and Lord of all. The examiner’s pressure point will be whether one can hold these attributes in their classical, strong sense without losing the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God who makes covenant, becomes incarnate, and suffers at the cross in Jesus Christ. A coherent defense requires showing that these attributes are not abstract metaphysical ornaments imported into theology, but the conceptual grammar needed to say what the scriptural confession of God as the living, self-existent, faithful Creator entails for his being and perfections.

**Simplicity** affirms that God is not composed of parts, principles, or accidents, but is identical with his essence and his attributes. **Aseity** states that God exists from himself and depends on nothing outside himself for being, life, or blessedness. **Immutability** claims that God is unchanging in being, perfections, decree, and covenant faithfulness. **Impassibility** asserts that God cannot suffer, be acted upon, or undergo emotional upheavals in a way that would compromise his fullness of life and lordship. Properly construed, these are not four detachable properties, but coordinated affirmations of one reality: the absolute fullness and independence of the triune God as Creator. To deny one attribute at a fundamental level is to erode the others.

Augustine is the first decisive figure, because he internalizes and reorients the patristic inheritance into a comprehensive Christian metaphysic. Writing in the late fourth and early fifth centuries in a world where Neoplatonism offered the most rigorous account of transcendence, Augustine insists that Christian Scripture demands something more radical than philosophical theism. In Confessions and De Trinitate he drives home the difference between Creator and creature by contrasting the mutability of his own will and affections with the absolute unchangeableness of God. God is the one who is, whose being does not ebb or flow, whose life is not a sequence of temporal moments. Here **aseity** emerges as a biblical claim: the God who says “I am who I am” simply is his own life. From this Augustinian vantage point, **simplicity** prevents us from relocating God’s being behind or under his perfections. God is not one thing and loving in addition; he is his own love, his own wisdom, his own power. That is why he cannot “gain” or “lose” anything in history, and why his **immutability** and **impassibility** are not emotional coldness, but the infinite plenitude of perfect love, never threatened, never improved.

An examiner might object that Augustine is simply baptizing Platonism, subjugating the biblical God to an alien notion of immutability. The proper reply is that Augustine’s **analogical knowledge** of God is driven by exegesis of texts that speak of God as the unchanging rock, the Father of lights in whom there is no variation or shadow due to change, and by the Creator–creature distinction. He appropriates metaphysical tools to safeguard revealed realities: God creates from nothing, is not one being among others, and is faithful to covenant promises. A mutable or passible God would be liable to disintegration under the pressure of history; for Augustine, only the God who is immeasurably beyond the flux of time can actually be the God of providence and grace. So his **simplicity** and **aseity** are not philosophical add-ons; they explicate what it means that all things live and move and have their being in him.

Thomas Aquinas extends and refines this Augustinian grammar in the high medieval scholastic synthesis, making him the second decisive figure and the chief architect of classical doctrine on these attributes. In the Summa Theologiae, Thomas starts with the question of God’s existence and then immediately argues that God must be absolutely simple. Anything composite requires parts and a cause that unites those parts. But the first cause cannot require something prior to compose it, or it would not be first. From this metaphysical argument he draws the strong conclusion that in God there is no composition of essence and existence, no composition of act and potency, no genus and differentia, and no distinction between substance and accidents. God is pure act, ipsum esse subsistens, subsisting being itself. **Simplicity** here is the lynchpin: if God has no passive potency, there is no substrate in him that could be actualized by another, which rules out any real change in God and thus grounds **immutability**.

Aquinas then shows how **aseity** follows. If God’s essence just is existence, then he does not receive being from another but exists of himself. There is no possible environment or condition in which God might not be; his nonexistence is impossible. **Aseity** is thus not a bare label, but the formal denial of any dependence or contingency in God’s being. From this, **impassibility** flows: passibility requires potency to be affected, but God is pure act and cannot be subject to motion, suffering, or external determination. Here the examiner will likely press: does Aquinas’s strong **impassibility** render the biblical pathos language false or merely metaphorical? Thomas answers with a doctrine of analogy and of mixed relations. The biblical statement that “God loves” is true, but “love” is predicated analogically; it names a perfection that exists in God without the creaturely mode of changeable emotions. So Scripture teaches that God loves, pities, and even “repents,” but these signify either effects in creatures or diverse relations in us to the one unchanging divine act.

Crucially, Aquinas insists that there is a real relation of creatures to God, because they depend on him, but only a logical relation of God to creatures. God’s being and internal life are not modified by the existence of the world. This is where internal and external debates sharpen. Internally, later Reformed theologians will wrestle with whether this language of nonreal relation in God adequately accounts for covenantal condescension, or whether it risks a static deity. Externally, modern critics accuse this of positing an aloof God. Yet for Aquinas, this grammar is precisely what secures God’s immanent presence in all things: because God does not change, the varied creaturely relations to him can be real without God undergoing flux. He can be simultaneously wrathful toward sin and gracious toward sinners because these are diverse relations of creatures to the one act of his simple, immutable will.

John Calvin, the third decisive figure, receives much of this patristic and medieval consensus but refracts it through his concern to speak in a more directly biblical register and in a polemical Reformation context. Calvin is not a systematic metaphysician, yet the Institutes articulate a distinctly classical doctrine of God. He vigorously asserts **aseity** by insisting that the name Jehovah expresses “self-existence,” that God is “the fountain of all life,” and that any talk of God’s becoming or receiving would destroy his deity. Calvin likewise affirms **immutability**: God does not change in will or counsel, for such change would imply ignorance or defect. On **impassibility**, he is less overtly metaphysical, but he sharply distinguishes between God’s internal life and the anthropopathic language of Scripture. When Scripture speaks of God repenting or being grieved, Calvin insists this is a “lisping” accommodation to our finite understanding, not a literal description of emotional reversal in God.

The internal Reformed debate emerges as later theologians, especially in the post-Reformation orthodox period, seek to give more systematic shape to what Calvin presupposes. Reformed scholastics such as Francis Turretin, following both Augustine and Aquinas, defend **simplicity** in robust terms: God’s attributes are really identical with his essence and with one another, distinguished only virtually and in our mode of conception. This doctrine undergirds Reformed **immutability** and **impassibility**. Yet they are wary of any formulation that appears to blunt the reality of God’s covenantal dealings. Hence the elaboration of **federal theology**: the immutable God freely wills to enter into temporal covenants, so that the history of redemption is a history of genuine divine actions without internal change in God. When examiners ask whether this turns God’s actions into mere appearances, the answer lies in the Reformed insistence on God’s free decree. God’s eternal, immutable will includes the determination to act at specific times and in various ways. The change lies wholly on the side of creatures as they are brought into new relations with the one, unchanging God.

Herman Bavinck represents a mature, self-conscious Reformed retrieval and critical deployment of the classical attributes in a modern context saturated with objections. Writing in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, deeply conversant with both scholasticism and modern theology, Bavinck is the fourth decisive figure. In Reformed Dogmatics he strongly reaffirms **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**, but he works hard to clarify misconceptions. For Bavinck, **simplicity** is not a denial of the richness of the divine life. He distinguishes between metaphysical and psychological simplicity. Metaphysically, God is without parts or composition; psychologically, God is full of life, knowledge, and will. He rebukes modern caricatures of classical theism as portraying a “frozen” deity and emphasizes that God is “pure act” and therefore the most living and active being, without the defects associated with change.

On **aseity**, Bavinck underscores that God’s independence means he has his blessedness in himself but does not imply aloofness or lack of concern. God’s love is utterly free, not compelled by need. This underwrites grace as truly gracious: the Creator–creature relation is not symbiotic but one of overflowing generosity. **Immutability**, for Bavinck, is not immobility but constancy in being, character, and purpose. God’s decree is unchangeable, but this eternal decree includes the entire history of changing relations between God and the world. Bavinck is especially helpful on **impassibility**, arguing that the tradition never meant to deny that God “has affections,” but rather that these are not like ours: they do not arise from deficiency, surprise, or coercion. Divine “anger” and “pity” are analogical names for the moral stance of the holy, loving God as it is revealed in changing circumstances.

Bavinck here positions himself against two external and contemporary tendencies. On the one side are rationalist or deist conceptions of God as distant, for which **impassibility** and **immutability** become excuses for noninvolvement. On the other side are modern reactionary movements, such as the theologies of divine suffering, that deny or radically revise these attributes to secure a more “personal” God. Bavinck argues that only the classical God is personal in a truly absolute sense: all creaturely personal traits that involve passivity or change are imperfect expressions of something that in God is wholly active, intentional, and sovereign. If we project our pathos into God univocally, we end up making him a fellow sufferer at the cost of his lordship. If the examiner raises the cross as the decisive challenge at this point, Bavinck’s Reformed Christology supplies the key: in the incarnation, the Son assumes a passible human nature. The triune God, in the person of the Son, truly suffers and dies in that nature, without change or suffering in the divine nature as such. The mystery is not that impassibility makes suffering impossible, but that the impassible God freely determines to take up a passible human life for our salvation.

Jürgen Moltmann represents a fifth decisive figure, not as a teacher of the classical doctrine but as a powerful modern challenger who forces one to sharpen why the classical position must be maintained. In The Crucified God Moltmann argues that the traditional notion of **impassibility** is incompatible with the God who suffers abandonment on the cross. For him, a God who cannot suffer cannot love; love necessarily entails vulnerability and being affected by the beloved. He redescribes the Trinity as eventful, constituted by the history of Jesus’ suffering and the Father’s pathos, suggesting an inner-trinitarian rupture and reconciliation. This move is tied to a rejection of **immutability** as a holdover of Greek metaphysics that cannot speak to Auschwitz or modern suffering.

Responding to Moltmann requires holding together two levels of critique. Historically, his characterization of classical **impassibility** is often one-sided, ignoring its own insistence that impassibility is not the denial of divine “affections” but their perfection. Conceptually, his collapsing of love into vulnerability trades the Creator–creature distinction for a mutual becoming where God’s being is conditioned by history. If God must suffer to love, then his eternal life before creation would be loveless, or at least incomplete. That contradicts any robust confession of the triune **aseity** and fullness of God. Those who follow Moltmann in speaking of God’s “becoming” God-in-history jeopardize **simplicity** and the stability of God’s promises. A God whose very being shifts under historical pressure cannot ground unshakeable hope.

Yet Moltmann’s challenge exposes a real theological responsibility: to articulate the ways in which the immutable, impassible God is truly involved with the world’s suffering. Here the classical tradition must lean on its Christology and on a doctrine of divine concurrence and presence. The incarnation is not a cosmetic overlay; the Son’s human suffering is personally the suffering of the Son of God. There is no second subject behind Jesus. Thus we can say truly that God suffers, yet we must add with Chalcedonian care that he does so according to the assumed human nature, not as God in se undergoing intrinsic change. Furthermore, God’s knowledge and will encompass all creaturely sufferings. He does not “learn” them; they are eternally present to him. His compassion is the eternal determination to bring good out of evil and to be “near to the brokenhearted.” These acts of mercy, willed immutably, unfold in time as real divine actions without requiring any mutation in God.

At this point, internal Reformed debates regarding the mode of predication and the structure of **analogical knowledge** become acute. Some contemporary Reformed theologians, wary of what they see as overly static metaphysics, propose loosening classical **simplicity** or affirming some form of real intrinsic relationality in God to the world. They fear that the Thomistic language of nonreal relation on God’s side either weakens the genuineness of God’s involvement or conflicts with the biblical portrayal of God entering new covenants and responding to prayer. Others, following a more pronounced scholastic path, insist that any such move smuggles creaturely composition into the divine being and hence must be resisted. The fundamental dividing line is whether one can maintain a strong doctrine of **pure actuality** while affirming the full personal and covenantal dynamism of the biblical God.

The position to defend is that of robust classical theism, critically retrieved. **Simplicity** in the strong sense must be upheld: God is not composed of parts, attributes, or accidents, and his essence is identical to his existence and perfections. This alone safeguards the absoluteness of **aseity**, God's self-existence and independence from all created conditions. From these follow strong **immutability** and **impassibility**: God does not undergo intrinsic change of being, knowledge, or will, and he cannot be passively affected or overwhelmed by his creatures. Yet, guided by a careful doctrine of **analogical knowledge**, we affirm that God truly loves, is angry, is merciful, and responds to his people, without these affections entailing creaturely emotional volatility in God. The entire story of Scripture, including the incarnation and cross, is the temporal enactment of the one eternal decree of the triune God.

In defending this position, one must be ready for examiners to raise texts about divine repentance, grief, and suffering. The reply is not to dismiss them as “mere” anthropomorphism, but to explain how anthropomorphic and anthropopathic language actually teaches true things about God in modes suited to finite minds. When God is said to “repent,” this signals a change in his external works and in the relation between creatures and God, not a revision of his eternal counsel. When God is said to be “grieved,” it reveals his holy opposition to sin and his loving concern for his creatures; yet this is the outworking in time of an eternal, unchanging moral stance. The analogy is: as grief in us accompanies the perception of evil, so the effects of God’s holy will in the face of evil resemble the actions of one who grieves, though in God there is no emotional destabilization.

Similarly, when the cross is pressed as the supreme instance of divine suffering, we answer that the church, following the fathers, confesses that one of the Trinity suffered in the flesh. The hypostatic union allows us to ascribe the human experiences of Jesus to the person of the Son, thereby speaking truly of God’s suffering, while maintaining that the divine nature remains impassible. This is not a dodge but the only way to hold together the Creator–creature distinction and the depth of the incarnation. If we instead posit that God as God suffers in his nature, we either collapse the distinction or make God dependent on the world for the fullness of his being, which contradicts **aseity** and undermines **immutability**.

Finally, one must show the interlacing of these attributes with other loci. **Simplicity** and **aseity** are foundational to **divine sovereignty** and **providence**: only the God who is not composed, not conditioned, and not in process can uphold all things and work all things according to the counsel of his will. **Immutability** safeguards the stability of the **covenant of grace**, for if God’s will or character could shift, his promises would be uncertain. **Impassibility** is correlative to God’s holiness and blessedness: he is light without admixture of darkness, life without the threat of dissolution. In soteriology, these attributes guarantee that the atonement is not an internal moral transformation of God from wrath to grace but the historical realization of a gracious purpose that is as old as God himself. In eschatology, they ground the believer’s hope that nothing in creation can separate us from the love of God in Christ, because that love is an expression of an unchangeable divine delight, not a passing feeling.

Thus, far from being speculative residue from Greek metaphysics, **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** are the conceptual scaffolding that prevents Christian theology from sliding into either mythological theogonies or modern reciprocal theisms where God and world mutually constitute one another. The classical doctrine, as articulated by Augustine, refined by Aquinas, received and extended by Calvin and Bavinck, and sharpened against the protests of theologians like Moltmann, provides a coherent, biblically accountable account of the living God, who is infinitely above all yet freely and truly with his people in Jesus Christ and by the Spirit. This is the God that a Westminster candidate must both confess and defend.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The one Creator God is **simple** and without parts, existing from himself in perfect **aseity**, without intrinsic change in being, will, or knowledge (**immutability**), and incapable of being passively affected or overwhelmed by creatures (**impassibility**), while truly relating to the world through analogical self-revelation and the incarnation.  
- Decisive figures: Augustine grounds these attributes in the Creator–creature distinction and biblical exegesis; Aquinas systematically derives **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** from God as pure act; Calvin receives the classical view and accents covenantal accommodation; Bavinck retrieves and clarifies classical theism in a modern context; Moltmann rejects strong **immutability** and **impassibility** in favor of a suffering, history-conditioned God.  
- Debates: Internally, disputes center on modes of predication, real versus logical relations in God, and Reformed adaptation of scholastic metaphysics; externally, process, open, and suffering-God theologies reject or weaken these attributes; contemporarily, questions arise about divine emotions, the cross, and relational ontology.  
- Defended position: A robust classical theism that affirms strong **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and qualified **impassibility**, reads anthropopathic language analogically, and locates divine suffering in the incarnate Son’s human nature, not in a mutable divine essence.  
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:  
  - How does **simplicity** avoid collapsing all attributes into a featureless monolith? By distinguishing attributes conceptually while affirming they are really identical with the one, infinitely rich divine essence.  
  - Does **immutability** contradict God’s responsiveness to prayer? No, God’s immutable decree includes his free decision to accomplish ends through genuinely responsive secondary causes and covenantal dealings.  
  - Can an **impassible** God truly love? Yes, because divine love is pure, active benevolence arising from fullness, not a vulnerable passion dependent on the beloved.  
  - Where is God’s suffering located at the cross? In the person of the Son according to his assumed human nature, so that God truly suffers without change in the divine nature.  
  - Are anthropomorphic texts “merely” metaphorical? They are analogical and accommodated, conveying true knowledge of God’s moral stance and actions without univocally attributing creaturely change and passions to him.
