# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth reinterpreted the classical **divine attributes** of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** in light of his Christocentric theology. While affirming God's transcendence and freedom, Barth insisted that these attributes must be understood through the self-revelation of God in **Jesus Christ**, rejecting any abstract metaphysical definitions detached from God's redemptive action.

- "God is who He is in the act of His revelation, and He is not otherwise." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics II/1: The Doctrine of God
- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- The Humanity of God
- Karl Barth: God’s Being Is in Becoming (Eberhard Jüngel)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Simplicity is relational, not abstract**
   - Rejects a static, metaphysical notion of **simplicity** in favor of a dynamic unity revealed in Christ.
   - God’s unity is not a mathematical oneness but the oneness of personal being-in-act.
   - Simplicity is seen in the coherence of God’s self-revelation, not in philosophical abstraction.
   - God’s triunity is the true form of His simplicity.
   - "God is simple in the unity of His being, which is the unity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit." (CD II/1)

2. **Aseity as freedom for relationship**
   - Affirms God’s **aseity** as self-existence, but always as the One who freely chooses to be for humanity.
   - God’s independence is not isolation but the freedom to love and relate.
   - God’s being is not self-contained but self-determined in His revelation.
   - Aseity is defined by God’s gracious initiative, not by metaphysical necessity.
   - "God is free to be God, and He is free for us." (CD II/1)

3. **Immutability as faithfulness in action**
   - God’s **immutability** is not immobility but unwavering faithfulness to His promises.
   - God’s constancy is expressed in His dynamic, covenantal engagement with creation.
   - Immutability means God is always true to Himself as revealed in Christ.
   - God’s being is in becoming, but without change in His divine purpose or character.
   - "God is immutable in the constancy of His faithfulness." (CD II/1)

4. **Impassibility redefined by divine love**
   - Rejects the classical notion of **impassibility** as emotional detachment.
   - God is impassible in that nothing can overcome or coerce Him, but He is not indifferent.
   - In Christ, God genuinely suffers and is affected by the world, yet always as Lord.
   - Divine impassibility is the perfection of God’s loving involvement, not the absence of feeling.
   - "God is impassible because He is not subject to any power outside Himself, but this does not mean He is incapable of passion." (CD II/1)

5. **Christological determination of all attributes**
   - All divine attributes are interpreted through the revelation of God in **Jesus Christ**.
   - The incarnation reveals the true meaning of simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility.
   - God’s attributes are not abstract qualities but are defined by His redemptive action.
   - The doctrine of God must be grounded in the history of salvation, not in philosophical speculation.
   - "We must learn from Christ what it means to say 'God'." (CD II/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s reconfiguration of the **divine attributes** has profoundly shaped modern theology, challenging both classical theism and liberal Protestantism. His insistence on a **Christocentric** approach to God’s being has influenced generations of theologians to ground doctrine in revelation rather than metaphysics. While some critics argue that Barth risks undermining classical doctrines, his work remains a pivotal reference point for contemporary discussions on the nature of God. Barth’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between God’s transcendence and immanence.
