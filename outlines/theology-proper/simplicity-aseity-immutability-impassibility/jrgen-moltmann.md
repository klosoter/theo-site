# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann reinterprets the **classical attributes of God**—such as **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**—in light of the **crucifixion** and the suffering of Christ. He contends that traditional doctrines, shaped by **Greek metaphysics**, fail to capture the biblical revelation of a God who suffers in solidarity with creation and whose being is defined by **relationality** and **self-giving love**.

- "A God who cannot suffer is poorer than any man." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1981)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- God in Creation (1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Critique of Classical Impassibility**
    - Argues that the doctrine of **impassibility** is rooted in Greek philosophy, not biblical revelation.
    - Maintains that a God who cannot suffer is incapable of true love or relationship.
    - Sees the cross as the definitive revelation of God's willingness to suffer.
    - Emphasizes that divine suffering is not a limitation but an expression of **divine freedom**.
    - "Only a suffering God can help." (The Crucified God)

2. **Relationality Over Simplicity**
    - Challenges the notion of **divine simplicity** as static and abstract.
    - Proposes that God's being is constituted by dynamic relationships, especially within the **Trinity**.
    - Suggests that God's unity is found in the perichoretic communion of Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - Argues that relationality does not compromise God's deity but fulfills it.
    - "God is love, and love is never solitary." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

3. **Redefinition of Aseity**
    - Rejects aseity as self-contained isolation; affirms God's self-existence as openness to the world.
    - God's being is self-determined, but this includes the freedom to be affected by creation.
    - The cross reveals God's willingness to enter into the suffering of the world.
    - Divine aseity is expressed in self-giving, not self-protection.
    - "God is not God without us." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **Dynamic Immutability**
    - Critiques the classical view of **immutability** as unchangeability in all respects.
    - Proposes that God's faithfulness, not metaphysical immobility, is the true ground of immutability.
    - God is unchanging in love and promise, but responsive in relationship.
    - The history of Jesus demonstrates God's capacity for newness and engagement.
    - "God remains true to himself by going out of himself." (The Crucified God)

5. **The Cross as Revelation of Divine Pathos**
    - The crucifixion is the central event for understanding God's attributes.
    - In the cross, God identifies with human suffering and death.
    - Divine **impassibility** is reinterpreted as the power to embrace suffering, not evade it.
    - The resurrection affirms that suffering is not the last word in God's being.
    - "The death of Christ on the cross is the centre of all Christian theology." (The Crucified God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s reconfiguration of **divine attributes** has profoundly influenced contemporary theology, especially in discussions of the **suffering of God** and the **Trinity**. His work has challenged traditional doctrines, prompting renewed engagement with biblical texts and the realities of suffering and evil. While controversial among classical theists, Moltmann’s emphasis on divine relationality and solidarity with creation continues to shape theological discourse on the nature of God.
