# Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758)

Jonathan Edwards addressed the question of Adam's possible perseverance in **original righteousness** within the framework of **covenant theology** and the **federal headship** of Adam. He maintained that had Adam not sinned, humanity would have continued in a state of **innocency**, with the potential for **eternal life** secured by obedience to the **covenant of works**.

- "If man had stood, he would have been confirmed in life, and all his posterity with him." (Original Sin)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Probationary**
    - Adam was placed under a **covenant of works** requiring perfect obedience.
    - The covenant held out the promise of **eternal life** upon successful probation.
    - Disobedience would result in **death** and loss of original righteousness.
    - The probationary period was real, with the possibility of Adam's perseverance.
    - "God entered into covenant with Adam, and made his standing or falling to be for him and his posterity." (Original Sin)

2. **Federal Headship and Representation**
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** for all humanity.
    - His obedience or disobedience would be imputed to his descendants.
    - Had Adam obeyed, his righteousness would have been reckoned to all.
    - The structure of representation is foundational to Edwards's anthropology.
    - "Adam stood as the head and representative of all mankind." (Original Sin)

3. **Possibility of Confirmation in Righteousness**
    - Edwards affirmed the real possibility of Adam being confirmed in holiness.
    - Perseverance would have led to an immutable state of blessedness.
    - This confirmation would mirror the angels' confirmation after their probation.
    - The reward would be both for Adam and his posterity.
    - "If Adam had stood, he and his posterity would have been confirmed in life." (Original Sin)

4. **Nature of Original Righteousness**
    - Adam was created in a state of **original righteousness** and innocence.
    - This righteousness was mutable, dependent on continued obedience.
    - The loss of this state was not inevitable but contingent on Adam's will.
    - The state of innocency was one of true, though unconfirmed, holiness.
    - "Man was at first created in a state of righteousness, but mutable." (Original Sin)

5. **Eschatological Implications**
    - The outcome of Adam’s obedience would have had cosmic consequences.
    - Humanity would have entered into a state of **eternal life** without death.
    - The world would have been filled with righteousness and joy.
    - The necessity of redemption through Christ would have been obviated.
    - "If Adam had stood, there would have been no need of Christ’s redemption." (Miscellanies)

## Legacy and Impact

Edwards’s reflections on Adam’s possible perseverance shaped later **Reformed discussions of covenant theology** and the nature of **original righteousness**. His articulation of **federal headship** and the consequences of Adam’s obedience or disobedience have been influential in both American and global Reformed thought. Edwards’s nuanced treatment of the covenant of works continues to inform contemporary debates on the relationship between law, gospel, and eschatology.
