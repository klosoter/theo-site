# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck addressed the question of Adam’s original state and the possibility of his continued obedience within the framework of **Reformed federal theology**. He emphasized the distinction between **natural life** and the **higher, eschatological life** promised in the **covenant of works**, arguing that Adam’s obedience would have led to a consummated, glorified state for humanity. Bavinck maintained that the **probationary command** was a means by which Adam could attain this higher destiny, rather than simply retain his original condition.

- "Adam, had he remained standing, would have passed from the state of posse non peccare to that of non posse peccare." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

- Our Reasonable Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Covenant of Works as Eschatological**
    - Adam was placed under a **covenant of works** with the promise of eternal, glorified life.
    - The probation was not merely to retain Eden, but to attain a higher, unlosable state.
    - The **tree of life** symbolized the reward of confirmed righteousness.
    - Human destiny was always oriented toward consummation, not mere preservation.
    - "The covenant of works was not intended to maintain Adam in the state in which he was created, but to raise him to a higher state." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.570)

2. **Distinction Between Natural and Higher Life**
    - Adam’s original state was good but not the highest possible for humanity.
    - The **image of God** in Adam was mutable and could be lost.
    - The higher life involved **immutability** and **eternal fellowship** with God.
    - Obedience would have led to a transformation beyond Edenic existence.
    - "Adam was destined to pass from the possibility of sinning to the impossibility of sinning." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.572)

3. **Probation and the Role of Law**
    - The command not to eat was a **probationary test** of obedience.
    - Law was not opposed to grace but was the means to a gracious reward.
    - Adam’s obedience was to be active, not merely passive.
    - The test was temporary, with the prospect of a permanent, blessed state.
    - "The law was the way to life, not life itself." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.573)

4. **Corporate and Federal Representation**
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity.
    - His obedience or disobedience would affect all his descendants.
    - The covenant structure undergirds both creation and redemption.
    - The principle of representation is foundational to Bavinck’s anthropology.
    - "Adam stood at the head of the human race as its representative." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.37)

5. **Christ as the Second Adam**
    - The unfallen Adam prefigures Christ’s role as **mediator** and **second Adam**.
    - Christ accomplishes what Adam failed to do, securing the higher life for his people.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to Bavinck’s soteriology.
    - The eschatological hope is realized in Christ, not in Adam’s original state.
    - "What Adam failed to obtain, Christ has acquired for us." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.384)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s articulation of the **covenant of works** and the eschatological orientation of creation has shaped modern Reformed theology’s understanding of Adam’s original state and destiny. His careful distinction between natural and consummated life, and his emphasis on federal representation, have influenced both systematic and biblical theology. Bavinck’s synthesis provides a robust theological framework for considering the question, “What if Adam had not sinned?” within the broader context of **redemptive history** and the work of Christ.
