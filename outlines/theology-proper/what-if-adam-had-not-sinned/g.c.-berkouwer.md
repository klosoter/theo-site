# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the question of Adam’s hypothetical obedience with caution, emphasizing the **historical reality of the Fall** and the **inseparability of creation and redemption**. He critiqued speculative theology regarding the **covenant of works** and the so-called **status integritatis**, arguing that Scripture does not provide a detailed account of what would have transpired had Adam not sinned, and that such speculation risks distorting the **Christocentric focus** of Reformed theology.

- "Scripture does not give us a picture of an unfallen humanity developing in history; it speaks of the reality of sin and redemption." (Sin, Studies in Dogmatics)

## Key Works

- Sin (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Man: The Image of God (Studies in Dogmatics)
- The Providence of God (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Faith and Justification (Studies in Dogmatics)
- The Work of Christ (Studies in Dogmatics)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Redemptive History**
    - Berkouwer insists that theology must be grounded in the **actual history of sin and redemption**, not hypothetical scenarios.
    - He warns against detaching **creation** from **redemption** in theological reflection.
    - The focus should remain on the **reality of Christ’s work** in response to the Fall.
    - Speculation about Adam’s obedience distracts from the central narrative of salvation.
    - "The history of salvation is not a history of possibilities, but of realities." (Sin)

2. **Critique of Speculative Covenant Theology**
    - Berkouwer questions the utility of the **covenant of works** as a speculative construct.
    - He argues that Scripture does not elaborate on a possible reward for Adam’s obedience.
    - Theological constructs must be drawn from biblical revelation, not philosophical necessity.
    - He is wary of projecting human logic onto divine mysteries.
    - "The covenant of works is not a revealed but a constructed doctrine." (Sin)

3. **Emphasis on the Status Integritatis**
    - Berkouwer recognizes the **status integritatis** as a theological category but resists detailed speculation about its development.
    - He affirms Adam’s original righteousness but stresses its historical, not hypothetical, significance.
    - The focus is on the loss of integrity and the need for **restoration in Christ**.
    - The doctrine should not overshadow the biblical narrative of the Fall and redemption.
    - "The status integritatis is not a stage to be developed, but a reality lost." (Man: The Image of God)

4. **Christocentric Orientation**
    - All theological reflection, including anthropology, must be oriented toward **Christ as the Second Adam**.
    - The meaning of humanity’s destiny is revealed in Christ, not in hypothetical alternatives.
    - The reality of sin and redemption is the context for understanding human nature.
    - Christ’s obedience, not Adam’s potential, is the ground of eschatological hope.
    - "In Christ, the meaning of humanity and its destiny is disclosed." (The Work of Christ)

5. **Rejection of Unnecessary Hypotheticals**
    - Berkouwer maintains that Scripture’s silence on Adam’s hypothetical obedience is theologically significant.
    - He cautions against constructing doctrines on the basis of what might have been.
    - The task of theology is to interpret God’s actual revelation and redemptive acts.
    - The focus must remain on the **gospel** and the reality of human sinfulness.
    - "The silence of Scripture is not a gap to be filled, but a boundary to be respected." (Sin)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s approach to the question of Adam’s hypothetical obedience has shaped modern **Reformed dogmatics** by discouraging speculative theology and emphasizing the centrality of **redemptive history**. His insistence on a **Christocentric** and biblically grounded method has influenced generations of theologians to focus on the realities of sin and grace rather than hypothetical alternatives. Berkouwer’s legacy endures in his call to respect the limits of revelation and to keep theological reflection anchored in the gospel.
