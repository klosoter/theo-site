# Peter Martyr Vermigli (1499–1562)

Peter Martyr Vermigli addressed the question of Adam’s possible perseverance in **original righteousness** and the implications for **covenant theology**. He maintained that Adam, had he not sinned, would have continued in a state of **innocence** and enjoyed the blessings of **immortality** and **communion with God**, but always as a result of God’s sustaining grace rather than inherent natural power. Vermigli’s reflections on this hypothetical scenario illuminate his understanding of the **covenant of works** and the distinction between **nature and grace**.

- "If Adam had persevered in obedience, he would have been confirmed in that good state and would have obtained immortality, not by nature, but by the gift of God." (Loci Communes)

## Key Works

- Loci Communes (notably the sections on creation, the fall, and original righteousness)
- Commentary on Genesis
- Commentary on Romans
- The Oxford Treatise and Disputations
- Peter Martyr Vermigli and the European Reformations (McLelland, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Covenant of Works as Conditional**
    - Adam was placed under a **covenant of works** requiring perfect obedience.
    - The promise of **life and immortality** was contingent on Adam’s continued righteousness.
    - Disobedience would result in **death and alienation** from God.
    - The covenant was not based on Adam’s intrinsic merit but on God’s sovereign arrangement.
    - "God made a covenant with Adam, promising life if he obeyed, and threatening death if he transgressed." (Loci Communes)

2. **Original Righteousness as Mutable**
    - Adam’s original state was one of **innocence** and uprightness, but not unchangeable.
    - He possessed the ability to obey or disobey, reflecting the **mutability** of his will.
    - Perseverance in righteousness required continual dependence on God’s grace.
    - Adam’s state was good, but not yet consummated or glorified.
    - "Adam was created good, but with the possibility of falling, for his will was free and mutable." (Commentary on Genesis)

3. **Immortality as a Gift, Not a Natural Possession**
    - Immortality was not inherent to Adam’s nature but was a **supernatural gift**.
    - Continued obedience would have led to the **confirmation** of immortality.
    - The tree of life symbolized the promise of ongoing life with God.
    - Adam’s natural constitution was subject to change apart from divine sustenance.
    - "Immortality was not natural to Adam, but would have been bestowed by God had he remained obedient." (Loci Communes)

4. **Nature and Grace Distinguished**
    - Vermigli distinguished between what Adam could do by **nature** and what required **grace**.
    - Adam’s natural faculties enabled obedience, but perseverance depended on God’s ongoing help.
    - Even in innocence, Adam was not autonomous from divine assistance.
    - The distinction underlines the necessity of grace for both creation and consummation.
    - "Even in the state of innocence, man needed the help of God to persevere in good." (Commentary on Genesis)

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the First Adam’s Failure**
    - The hypothetical of Adam’s obedience highlights the necessity of **Christ’s obedience** after the Fall.
    - Christ fulfills the **covenant of works** that Adam failed to keep.
    - The blessings forfeited by Adam are restored and surpassed in Christ.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to Vermigli’s soteriology.
    - "What Adam lost by disobedience, Christ has restored by his perfect obedience." (Commentary on Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

Vermigli’s nuanced articulation of the **covenant of works** and the hypothetical state of Adam shaped later Reformed discussions on **federal theology**. His careful distinction between **nature and grace** influenced both continental and English Reformed thought. Vermigli’s engagement with the question of Adam’s possible perseverance provided a foundation for later theologians to clarify the relationship between creation, fall, and redemption in the history of salvation.
