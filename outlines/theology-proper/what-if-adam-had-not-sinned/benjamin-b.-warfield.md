# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached the question of Adam’s hypothetical obedience through the lens of **federal theology** and the **covenant of works**. He maintained that had Adam not sinned, humanity would have inherited **confirmed righteousness** and **eternal life** as a result of Adam’s representative obedience, thus avoiding the need for **redemption** through Christ.

- "If Adam had stood, he would have secured for his race, not merely continued probation, but eternal life." (Biblical Doctrines)

## Key Works

- Biblical Doctrines (especially the essay "The Plan of Salvation")
- The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 9: Studies in Theology
- "The Westminster Confession and Its Doctrine of the Covenant" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The New Testament Terminology of Redemption" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Foundational**
    - Adam was placed under a **covenant of works** with God in Eden.
    - The promise attached to obedience was **eternal life** for Adam and his posterity.
    - Disobedience would bring **death** and alienation from God.
    - The covenant of works is distinct from the later **covenant of grace**.
    - "The covenant of works was the foundation of all subsequent dealings of God with men." (Studies in Theology)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the **federal representative** for all humanity.
    - His obedience or disobedience would be imputed to his descendants.
    - This federal principle undergirds both **original sin** and the possibility of **imputed righteousness**.
    - The structure parallels Christ’s headship in the covenant of grace.
    - "In Adam all die, in Christ all are made alive, because both are heads of covenants." (Biblical Doctrines)

3. **Confirmed Righteousness as the Reward**
    - Had Adam obeyed, he would have passed from a state of **mutable innocence** to **immutable righteousness**.
    - This would have meant the end of probation and the securing of eternal life.
    - The reward was not mere continuation in Eden, but a higher, confirmed state.
    - This concept is rooted in the **eschatological** orientation of Reformed theology.
    - "The reward of obedience was not simply continued life, but life raised above the possibility of sinning." (Studies in Theology)

4. **Necessity of Redemption Only After the Fall**
    - The work of **redemption** through Christ is only necessitated by Adam’s failure.
    - Without the Fall, there would be no need for the **covenant of grace**.
    - The incarnation and atonement are responses to human sin, not original features of creation.
    - The history of salvation is thus contingent on Adam’s disobedience.
    - "Redemption is the answer to sin; had there been no sin, there would have been no Redeemer." (Biblical Doctrines)

5. **Continuity of Divine Purpose**
    - God’s **sovereign purpose** encompasses both the possibility of Adam’s obedience and the reality of his fall.
    - The structure of the covenants reveals God’s consistent dealings with humanity.
    - Even the hypothetical of Adam’s obedience serves to highlight the wisdom of God’s redemptive plan.
    - Warfield emphasizes the unity of **God’s decree** in both creation and redemption.
    - "The divine plan is one, embracing both creation and redemption, and is executed through covenants." (The Plan of Salvation)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of the **covenant of works** and the implications of Adam’s hypothetical obedience shaped subsequent Reformed discussions on **federal theology** and the structure of redemptive history. His careful distinction between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace** provided clarity for later theologians grappling with the relationship between creation, fall, and redemption. Warfield’s influence endures in systematic theology, especially in debates about the nature of original righteousness and the necessity of Christ’s work.
