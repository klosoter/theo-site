### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether under the **covenant of works** Adam, had he persevered, would have led humanity into **eschatological life** without the **hypostatic union**, and how this relates to God’s **decree**, nature–grace ordering, and Christ’s mediatorial office.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, John Calvin, Francis Turretin, Maximus the Confessor.
- Traditions: Patristic anthropology and eschatology, medieval nature–grace and motive of the incarnation, Reformed scholastic **federal theology**.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Reformed disputes about the reality and shape of the **covenant of works**, the character of prelapsarian “merit” (**merit ex pacto**), and the telos signaled by Sabbath and tree of life.
  - External: Scotist absolute predestination of Christ; Eastern accounts of deification and incarnation irrespective of sin; Barth’s rejection of the covenant of works.
  - Contemporary: Historical Adam and evolutionary models; Christocentric claims that incarnation is necessary apart from sin; analytic concerns about counterfactuals under **divine simplicity**.
- Position defended: Had Adam not sinned, by persevering under the **covenant of works** he would have been confirmed for himself and his posterity into immutable righteousness and **eschatological life** without a mediator; the incarnation is decreed in view of sin, not as an absolute necessity apart from the fall, while the Son remains the archetypal telos of creation.

### ESSAY
The question “What if Adam had not sinned?” is not a curiosity but a controlled inference from revealed covenantal structure. Scripture discloses a real conditional embedded in God’s governance of the first man: life by obedience, death by disobedience. The counterfactual is therefore covenantal rather than speculative. We ask what that promise of life entailed, whether it implied an elevation beyond the garden’s probation, and how such an end would relate to Christ’s mediatorial advent. The answer turns on four axes: the nature of Adam’s original state, the character of the offer held forth in the garden, the mode of merit and confirmation under that offer, and the motive of the incarnation. The focal claim defended here is that, under the **covenant of works**, Adam’s perseverance would have led to his and his posterity’s confirmed righteousness and **eschatological life** without the **hypostatic union**, since the incarnation is ordered to redemption from sin rather than to a sinless elevation, even as the Son remains the archetype and telos of creation as such.

Augustine serves as the decisive Patristic point of departure because he establishes the grammar of the human states relative to God: posse non peccare in the state of integrity, non posse peccare in the state of glory. In De correptione et gratia and City of God, Augustine argues that Adam was created in **original righteousness**, endowed with rectitude of will and ordered affections, yet not confirmed in the inability to sin. He treats the garden’s probation as a genuine ordeal, one that could have issued in an unlosable good. Augustine reads the tree of life as a real sign of immortality and thus a **sacrament** of a higher stability God would have conferred had the trial been completed. He is also careful to distinguish kinds of grace. Adam’s very being and rectitude were gratuitous, but not remedial. The donum perseverantiae, in the sense of infallible perseverance, was not bestowable upon Adam in probation as if it would dissolve the test; rather, it would have been the end-state gift had he stood. This Augustinian pattern grounds the later Reformed insistence that the garden promise held out more than Edenic maintenance. It also inoculates against Pelagian confusions. When examiners press whether Adam “needed grace” to obey, the Augustinian answer is that he needed God’s sustaining **providence** and created rectitude, not remedial grace, for the probation. The higher, unlosable good would have been a further gratuitous confirmation after obedience. The crucial conceptual anchor is that the Creator-creature distinction remains intact throughout; even confirmation would not collapse nature into God but perfect human **analogical knowledge**, love, and delight under immutable righteousness.

Thomas Aquinas sharpens the teleology and the nature–grace ordering with exceptional precision. In the Summa theologiae, Aquinas posits that Adam possessed certain preternatural gifts—freedom from disordered passions, immunity from death—and sanctifying grace, ordered toward the **beatific vision** as man’s final end. For Thomas, even apart from sin, human nature cannot attain the vision of God by its own created powers; the vision requires an elevation by grace. This becomes crucial for the Edenic counterfactual. If Adam had persevered, God would have translated him into glory, not by nature’s intrinsic trajectory but by a further divine gift corresponding to the end already signaled in the order of creation. The Sabbath in Genesis 2, read Christologically and eschatologically, functions in this register as a sign of consummation. Aquinas’s account allows us to say that Adam’s obedience could have merited glory, but not condignly relative to God. Rather, under a divine ordination, the obedience of a righteous man in grace would be acceptably rewarded by God. Here the distinction later articulated as **merit ex pacto** emerges. If examiners worry that this collapses grace into nature or erases the Creator-creature asymmetry, the Thomistic answer is the opposite: the disproportion is respected by denying condignity while affirming that God, by establishing a covenant, binds himself to reward according to his promise. It follows that an unfallen humanity’s end would be grace-crowned, not nature-closed, and that this elevation is not dependent upon a mediator if the probation is fulfilled in the unfallen covenant head.

At this point the medieval debate about the motive of the incarnation must be faced. John Duns Scotus argues for the absolute predestination of Christ: the decree to unite a human nature to the Word stands prior logically to any foreseen sin and would have occurred even had Adam stood. Scotus’s rationale is the maximal manifestation of divine glory in the greatest possible created effect. Christ is the first intention of God’s creative will, with redemption a contingent consequent. If adopted, Scotus’s view reshapes the Edenic counterfactual entirely: even without sin, the **hypostatic union** would have occurred to crown creation, perhaps as a head of a sinless humanity rather than as Redeemer. And it would relocate the meaning of Adam’s probation and reward under the primacy of Christ’s intrinsic excellence, not purely under the bilateral **covenant of works**. Scotus’s brilliance lies in recognizing that the Son’s primacy is not a mere remedial fix. Yet the cost of his thesis is felt most keenly when we consider Pauline Adam-Christ typology. Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 cast Christ specifically as last Adam, whose obedience answers Adam’s disobedience and whose resurrection life conquers death. The typology is not neutral but redemptive-historical. Moreover, the canonical presentation of the incarnation, cross, and resurrection is saturated with atonement intent. While Scotus can reply that a sinless incarnation could be differently configured, Aquinas’s prudence here is exegetically safer: it is more fitting to say that the incarnation is ordered to sin’s remedy, even if God could have done otherwise.

The Reformation’s decisive move is to formalize the Adamic probation in terms of **federal headship** and an explicitly covenantal order. John Calvin recognizes a promise of life held forth to Adam under a law that contained a positive, probationary command. The tree of life is for Calvin a **sacrament** of the life God pledged, and the Sabbath is a sign of the rest God set before man as his goal. Calvin resists language of condign merit and speaks instead of divine condescension: God freely entered into a legal arrangement whereby obedience would be rewarded according to stipulation. Calvin’s federal framing prepares the ground for explicit Reformed scholastic articulation. It also clarifies two examiner-sensitive points. First, justification language pertains to pardon and righteousness imputed to sinners; it would not have applied to an unfallen order. The category in Eden is not justification but confirmation and life under the **covenant of works**. Second, adoption in Christ is redemptive-eschatological sonship; while Adam is a son by creation, full filial communion in Christ presupposes the Mediator’s redemptive headship. In an unfallen world there is filial relation by creation and elevation to God as end, but no mediatorial adoption as remedial grace.

Francis Turretin codifies these lines in a way that addresses the hard questions examiners will press. For Turretin, Genesis 2 and Hosea 6.7 imply an explicit **covenant of works** with Adam, the condition being perfect and personal obedience, the promise being **eschatological life** signified by the tree of life and Sabbath, the sanction being death. Turretin insists that the righteousness required for confirmation is not infinite but proportioned to Adam’s finite status and the testing period that God ordained. Crucially, he rejects condign merit while defending **merit ex pacto**. Because God freely pledged life upon obedience, Adam’s obedience would have been truly rewardable. Had Adam obeyed, God would have confirmed him and his posterity in a state of non posse peccare, perhaps by translation to heaven or a glorified earth. Turretin refuses speculative detail beyond the revealed contours but maintains the core point: no **hypostatic union**, no priestly mediation, no atonement would have been necessary for man to reach his end, because the condition of the covenant would have been fulfilled by the primal head. To anticipated objections that this diminishes Christ’s cosmic centrality, Turretin’s answer is patterned on classical Christology and **divine simplicity**. The Son as eternal Word is the archetypal image and end of creation regardless, the one in whom and for whom all things were made. The created order is still ordered to the Son as exemplar and end. But Christ’s mediatorial office as God-man is historically and covenantally ordered to sin. That distinction preserves both the primacy of the Son and the integrity of the federal structure revealed in Genesis and expounded by Paul.

An Eastern voice, Maximus the Confessor, introduces a distinct and theologically rich frame. Maximus envisions creation as ordered to deification, the unification of the many logoi in the one Logos. In this vision Christ recapitulates all things, healing divisions and uniting the extremes in his person. Many interpreters of Maximus claim he would affirm an incarnation apart from sin, because the union of God and creation is the destined consummation. If read this way, Maximus seems to stand closer to the Scotist claim: the incarnation as the teleological center irrespective of lapse. This construal forcefully raises the question of man’s end and the meaning of deification. A Reformed response appropriates Maximus’s cosmic Christology at the level of exemplar and end while resisting an unqualified claim that the **hypostatic union** is absolutely intended apart from sin. The reason is twofold. First, the New Testament saturates Christ’s mission with atonement intent; he appears “to save his people from their sins,” to destroy the works of the devil, to die for the ungodly, and to rise for our justification. Second, the deification promised to the saints is by union with the crucified and risen Christ and the indwelling of the Spirit poured out by the Mediator. In the unfallen scenario, the Creator-creature distinction remains absolute, and the perfected end for Adam is not ontological participation in the divine essence but a grace-crowned, creaturely fruition of God. The Reformed can say with Maximus that creation’s end is communion with God in the Logos while denying that this communion required a sinless incarnation, locating deification strictly within the soteriological economy.

From these figures we may draw out the three layers of debate, beginning with internal Reformed disputes. Some within the tradition hesitate to use the term **covenant of works**, preferring to speak of a covenant of life, or to mute the concept of “merit” altogether. John Murray famously questioned the propriety of merit language for a creature even by covenant. Yet the backbone of the doctrine, as represented by Calvin, Turretin, Witsius, and later systematized by Vos and Kline, remains exegetically secure: a probationary arrangement with promise and threat, sacramentally signified and eschatologically oriented. The Sabbath and the tree of life mark an end beyond mere maintenance. The notion of **merit ex pacto** avoids loading creaturely obedience with metaphysical weight it cannot bear and instead anchors the reward in God’s free stipulation. Another internal question is whether Adam would have attained the **beatific vision**. The classic Reformed answer, consonant with Aquinas, is yes understood as creaturely fruition of God, though not by nature alone but by a further divine act crowning persevering obedience. This is not a redemptive infusion of sanctifying grace but an eschatological gift corresponding to the original promise. When asked whether Adam “had the Spirit,” a careful answer notes that Adam had rectitude and life from the Spirit as Creator; the special indwelling as down payment of redemption is unique to the new covenant economy.

External debates begin with Scotus and move to Barth. Against Scotus we hold that the biblical storyline assigns the incarnation principally to the remedy of sin. To posit a sinless incarnation as absolute decree risks detaching Christ’s person from his work in the canon’s own presentation. Barth, however, rejects the **covenant of works** as a legalistic foil to the covenant of grace, treating election in Christ as the primal and only covenantal reality. The Reformed reply is that Scripture itself presents law and gospel in covenantal sequence and contrast, and Paul’s two-Adam discourse depends on a real probation and failure. To deny the **covenant of works** is to obscure the justice of God’s judgment and the representational logic by which Christ’s obedience counts for many. Eastern proposals of deification and incarnation apart from sin, as associated with Maximus or Palamas, must be received with appreciative caution. The Reformed affirm deification in the biblical sense of filial communion by grace through union with Christ, but resist any blurring of the Creator-creature boundary or an absolute necessity of the incarnation apart from sin.

Contemporary debates press two edges. First, evolutionary models and the denial of a historical Adam unsettle the very grammar of **federal headship**. If there is no primal pair, the revealed covenantal alternative collapses. The Reformed must defend a historical Adam on exegetical and theological grounds, not least because Romans 5’s logic of imputation and Christ’s last Adam work presuppose it. Second, modern Christocentric claims, often influenced by Scotus or certain readings of Maximus and Torrance, propose that the incarnation is the crown of creation irrespective of sin. The rejoinder is not to diminish the Son’s primacy but to distinguish his primacy as the eternal Word, by whom and for whom all things exist, from his mediatorial mission in history. The former is absolute; the latter is ordered to redemption. A third contemporary concern is metaphysical: does speaking of counterfactuals violate **divine simplicity** and the unicity of the **decree**? The answer is that we are not positing alternate divine willing within God but reading a revealed conditional within the covenant. Under the one simple decree, God willed to glorify himself through the actual history of fall and redemption. To ask what the covenantal promise implies had Adam not sinned is to understand that history’s revealed teleology, not to multiply decrees in God.

If Adam had not sinned, how would history have unfolded? Under the **covenant of works**, his probation would have ended in confirmation and life. He would have been translated to a state of non posse peccare and non posse mori, and his offspring, represented **federally**, would have shared that confirmed state. The earth would have been cultivated into a global temple. The sons and daughters of Adam would have filled the world with righteousness. The sacramental signs of the old creation, Sabbath and tree, would have yielded to the reality of unending rest and life. There would have been no altar, no blood of atonement, no mediator-priest, because none would be needed. Yet the Son of God would remain the archetype and end of human life. All human knowing would be **analogical knowledge** of the Father through the eternal Son in the Spirit. The difference is that the Son would not have assumed flesh to redeem; instead he would be the creature’s final cause and exemplar, and the Spirit would consummate creaturely life without the peculiar ministry of atonement and adoption that presuppose sin.

Examiners will press particular points. Would there have been sacraments? In the strict redemptive sense, no. In the creational-covenantal sense, yes: the tree of life and the Sabbath are true **sacraments** of promise. Would Adam’s obedience be infinite? No; it would be perfect and proportional to his finite state during the period God appointed. Could a finite obedience meet an infinite good? Not by condignity, but truly by **merit ex pacto**, because God condescended to bind himself by promise. Would there be death in nature? There would be no human death; the scope of animal mortality is debated, but the focus of the covenant’s sanction is man. Would Adam and his seed have seen God? They would have enjoyed the creaturely **beatific vision** granted by God, as the end signaled by Sabbath and tree. Did Adam possess the Spirit? He possessed created righteousness and life from the Spirit; the eschatological indwelling that seals to the day of redemption belongs to the post-fall mediatorial economy. Would there be justification? No, because justification addresses guilt; rather, there would be confirmation in righteousness. Would there be adoption? There would be filial communion by creation; adoptive sonship in union with the Mediator is a gift of redemption.

Why does all this matter for Christology and soteriology now? Because the unfallen counterfactual clarifies what Christ has won for us. The last Adam’s obedience secures what the first Adam forfeited: immutable righteousness and **eschatological life**. The presence of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem confirms that Christ’s mediation does not alter the goal set in creation but restores and surpasses it, since grace after sin does not merely return us to Eden but carries us to irreversible communion. Moreover, the structure underwrites penal substitution and imputation. If Adam’s act could condemn many, Christ’s obedience can justify many; if Adam’s failed probation withheld confirmation, Christ’s successful obedience grants it. Denying the **covenant of works** blurs this architecture and often leads to moral-evolutionary or purely participatory soteriologies that cannot carry the apostolic logic.

Against Scotus and modern Christocentrists, we emphasize the canonical portrayal of the incarnation as redemptive in intent. Against Barthian dissolutions, we insist that the law-gospel dialectic is covenantally real and that the Adamic probation is not a construct but a biblical framework. Against Eastern overextensions of deification, we safeguard the Creator-creature distinction while confessing maximal communion by grace in Christ. Within our own tradition, we keep “merit” properly circumscribed, the Sabbath and tree as signs of a real ascent, and **federal headship** as the backbone of Pauline soteriology.

The upshot is a coherent picture. The one God, in **divine simplicity**, decreed from eternity to glorify himself through creation and redemption. Within that decree he willed to govern man by a **covenant of works**, thereby setting before him a path to **eschatological life** that Adam in fact rejected. The counterfactual therefore teaches us what Christ, the last Adam, actually achieved. Had Adam not sinned, there would have been no cross, but there would still have been Christ as archetype and end. Because Adam did sin, Christ came as mediator, priest, and king, to do by obedience what Adam failed to do and to grant by **adoption** and the Spirit what Adam could only have received by creaturely confirmation. The difference is not one of goal but of means: from probation to mediation, from covenantal promise to fulfilled promise in cruciform glory. Such an answer guards doctrinal coherence across loci, preserves historical accuracy, and equips a candidate to withstand probing on nature–grace, merit, the **decree**, and the motive of the incarnation.

### RECAP NOTES
