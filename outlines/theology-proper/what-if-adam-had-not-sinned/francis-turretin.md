# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a central figure in post-Reformation **Reformed scholasticism**, addressed Adam’s possible perseverance in **original righteousness** within the framework of **covenant theology**. He maintained that under the **Covenant of Works**, Adam could have attained eternal life for himself and his posterity through perfect obedience, emphasizing the conditional and representational nature of this covenant.

- "If Adam had persevered in innocence, he would have been translated to a state of confirmed happiness and glory, not by nature, but by the promise and grace of the covenant." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 5.10.8)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 1, Topics 8–10)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary, Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)
- The Doctrine of Man (secondary, Richard A. Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics)
- The Covenant of Works (secondary, J.V. Fesko)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Conditionality of the Covenant of Works**
    - Adam’s continued life and eventual glorification were conditioned on perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience.
    - The **promise of life** was not inherent to Adam’s nature but attached to the covenant arrangement.
    - Failure to obey would result in death for Adam and his descendants.
    - The covenant was a legal arrangement distinct from the **Covenant of Grace**.
    "The promise of life was not due to Adam by nature, but by the pact and gratuitous condescension of God." (Institutes, 5.9.4)

2. **Distinction Between Natural and Supernatural Gifts**
    - Adam’s **original righteousness** was a supernatural gift, not part of his essential human nature.
    - Immortality and the possibility of glorification were not natural rights but covenantal blessings.
    - Adam’s faculties were mutable, capable of both obedience and disobedience.
    - The supernatural end (heavenly life) was above Adam’s created state.
    "Immortality and the confirmation in good were not due to Adam by nature, but by the promise of the covenant." (Institutes, 5.10.8)

3. **Possibility of Adam’s Perseverance**
    - Adam was created with the ability to obey and persevere.
    - Perseverance was possible but not guaranteed apart from continued obedience.
    - God’s grace in the covenant enabled Adam to fulfill its terms, but did not make him impeccable.
    - Adam’s probation had a definite duration, after which confirmation was possible.
    "Adam could have persevered, but he was not confirmed in good; he was able to fall." (Institutes, 5.10.7)

4. **Federal Headship and Posterity**
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity in the Covenant of Works.
    - His obedience or disobedience would affect all his descendants.
    - Had Adam obeyed, his posterity would have inherited righteousness and life.
    - The principle of representation undergirded both condemnation and potential reward.
    "If Adam had stood, the same covenant would have been ratified with his posterity." (Institutes, 5.9.7)

5. **Contrast with the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Covenant of Works was based on law and obedience; the **Covenant of Grace** is based on Christ’s merit.
    - Adam’s possible reward was temporal and heavenly life; believers receive eternal life through Christ.
    - The failure of the first covenant necessitated the establishment of the second.
    - The two covenants illustrate the difference between law and gospel in **Reformed theology**.
    "The law was given to Adam as a covenant of works, but the gospel is the covenant of grace." (Institutes, 12.1.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of the **Covenant of Works** and the hypothetical state of Adam before the Fall shaped subsequent Reformed orthodoxy. His distinctions between natural and supernatural gifts, and between law and gospel, became foundational for later covenant theology. Turretin’s careful analysis continues to inform debates on **federal headship** and the structure of redemptive history within Reformed systematic theology.
