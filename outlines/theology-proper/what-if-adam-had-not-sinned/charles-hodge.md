# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Reformed theology**, addressed the question of Adam’s original state and the hypothetical scenario of his perseverance in obedience. Hodge maintained that Adam was created in a state of **probation** under the **Covenant of Works**, with the promise of **eternal life** contingent on perfect obedience. If Adam had not sinned, Hodge argued, humanity would have inherited **confirmed righteousness** and the blessings of the covenant without the need for **redemption**.

- "Had Adam kept the covenant, he would have secured for himself and his posterity eternal life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially chapters on the Fall and Covenant of Works)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons (selected lectures on anthropology and original sin)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as Federal Head**
    - Adam represented all humanity in the **Covenant of Works**.
    - His obedience or disobedience would determine the fate of his descendants.
    - The principle of **imputation** undergirds both the fall and the hypothetical reward.
    - The federal relationship is foundational for understanding original righteousness and sin.
    - "Adam was the representative of his race, and his probation was their probation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Covenant of Works Promised Eternal Life**
    - The covenant entailed a positive promise of **eternal life** for obedience.
    - Hodge argued this was more than mere continued existence; it implied confirmed blessedness.
    - The **tree of life** symbolized this reward.
    - The covenant was a gracious arrangement, not a mere legal contract.
    - "The promise was not simply of continued life, but of that confirmed and consummated life which is called eternal." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Confirmed Righteousness as the Result of Obedience**
    - Had Adam obeyed, he and his posterity would have been established in **immutable holiness**.
    - The possibility of falling would have been removed.
    - This state would parallel the glorified condition of the redeemed.
    - The entire human race would have shared in this confirmed state.
    - "Perseverance in holiness would have issued in a state of confirmed and indefectible blessedness." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **No Need for Redemption if Adam Had Not Sinned**
    - The work of **Christ as Redeemer** would not have been necessary.
    - Humanity would have enjoyed direct communion with God.
    - The **curse**, death, and suffering would have been avoided.
    - The history of salvation would have been radically different.
    - "Had Adam kept the covenant, there would have been no occasion for redemption." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Providence and the Possibility of Sin**
    - God’s providence permitted the possibility of Adam’s fall but did not necessitate it.
    - The probationary arrangement was just and wise.
    - The hypothetical non-fall demonstrates the justice of God’s government.
    - The scenario underscores the importance of **free moral agency**.
    - "The possibility of sin was involved in the very nature of probation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **Covenant of Works** and the hypothetical outcome of Adam’s obedience has shaped much of subsequent Reformed anthropology. His clear distinction between **federal headship** and the necessity of redemption provided a framework for later systematic theologians. Hodge’s influence endures in discussions of original righteousness, the nature of probation, and the theological rationale for Christ’s work as the second Adam.
