# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth approached the question of Adam's hypothetical obedience within the framework of **Christocentric election** and the **covenant of grace**. For Barth, speculation about a sinless Adam is ultimately subordinate to the reality of **God’s self-revelation in Christ**, who is both the ground and goal of humanity, rendering the "what if" question theologically secondary to the actual history of **reconciliation**.

- "The Bible knows nothing of a human existence which is not confronted with the question of obedience or disobedience." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics III/1: The Doctrine of Creation
- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics II/2: The Doctrine of God (Election)
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- The Humanity of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the True Adam**
    - Christ, not Adam, is the definitive revelation of true humanity.
    - The meaning and destiny of humanity are found in **Jesus Christ**.
    - Adam’s role is typological, pointing forward to Christ’s fulfillment.
    - The "what if" of Adam is relativized by the actuality of Christ’s obedience.
    - "Jesus Christ is Himself the divine decision concerning the being of man." (CD III/2)

2. **Rejection of Speculative Anthropology**
    - Barth resists hypothetical constructions about Adam’s possible obedience.
    - Theological focus must remain on what God has actually done in history.
    - Speculation distracts from the concrete reality of **reconciliation**.
    - The fall is not a metaphysical necessity but a historical event.
    - "Dogmatics cannot speculate about a history of man apart from the history of sin." (CD IV/1)

3. **Election as the Foundation of Humanity**
    - **Election** is centered in Christ, not in a prelapsarian Adam.
    - Humanity’s destiny is determined by God’s gracious choice in Christ.
    - Adam’s potential obedience is not the basis for human blessedness.
    - The covenant of grace precedes and grounds all human history.
    - "In Jesus Christ God has from all eternity adopted man into fellowship with Himself." (CD II/2)

4. **Covenant of Grace, Not Works**
    - Barth rejects a strict **covenant of works** as a separate pre-fall arrangement.
    - The relationship between God and humanity is always one of grace.
    - Adam’s existence is already encompassed by God’s gracious purpose.
    - The law serves the covenant of grace, not an autonomous works principle.
    - "The covenant of grace is the meaning and goal of creation." (CD III/1)

5. **Sin as the Context for Redemption**
    - The reality of sin is presupposed in the history of redemption.
    - The question of Adam’s non-sinning is overshadowed by the universality of sin.
    - Redemption in Christ is the central theme, not hypothetical innocence.
    - The fall is the context in which **reconciliation** is revealed and accomplished.
    - "The fall is the presupposition of reconciliation, not its alternative." (CD IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s approach decisively shifted the focus from speculative **prelapsarian** scenarios to the concrete reality of **Christ’s redemptive work**. His critique of the **covenant of works** and emphasis on the **covenant of grace** influenced later Reformed and ecumenical theology, challenging traditional distinctions between law and gospel. Barth’s Christocentric anthropology continues to shape contemporary discussions on the meaning of humanity and the significance of Adam in salvation history.
