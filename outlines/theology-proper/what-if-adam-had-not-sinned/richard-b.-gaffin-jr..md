# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the question of Adam’s hypothetical obedience through the lens of **Reformed federal theology**, emphasizing the significance of the **covenant of works** and its eschatological orientation. He maintains that Adam’s probation was not merely about avoiding sin, but about attaining a higher, **consummate life**—a movement from **original righteousness** to glorified existence, which is ultimately realized in Christ, the second Adam.

- "The probationary arrangement with Adam was not simply about maintaining the status quo, but about advancing to a higher, confirmed state of life." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- "The Eschatological Implications of Adam’s Probation" (in Kingdom, Covenants & Canon of the Old Testament, lectures)
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "The Work of Christ Applied" (in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam’s Probation Was Eschatological**
    - Adam’s obedience was designed to lead to a higher, **eschatological state** beyond Eden.
    - The **covenant of works** was not static but pointed to a consummation.
    - Adam’s task was not only to avoid death but to attain glorified life.
    - The eschatological goal prefigures the work of Christ, the last Adam.
    - "Adam’s obedience was to result in a confirmed, glorified life, not merely the maintenance of Edenic existence." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **The Covenant of Works as a Real Historical Arrangement**
    - The **covenant of works** is a foundational, historical reality in Gaffin’s theology.
    - Adam’s role as federal head means his actions had consequences for all humanity.
    - The arrangement was not hypothetical but a real probation with real stakes.
    - The possibility of Adam’s obedience was genuine, not illusory.
    - "The covenant of works is not a speculative construct but a biblical reality with redemptive-historical significance." (Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards)

3. **Original Righteousness Was Not the Goal**
    - Adam’s original state was good but not the final goal for humanity.
    - The **image of God** in Adam was to be brought to consummation through obedience.
    - The movement from innocence to glory is central to Gaffin’s anthropology.
    - The ultimate destiny for humanity was always eschatological transformation.
    - "Adam’s original righteousness was provisional, pointing beyond itself to a higher, confirmed state." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Adam’s Task**
    - Christ, as the second Adam, accomplishes what the first Adam failed to do.
    - The **resurrection of Christ** is the realization of the eschatological life Adam was offered.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to understanding redemption.
    - The obedience of Christ secures for believers what Adam’s obedience would have secured.
    - "The resurrection is the eschatological fulfillment of what was offered to Adam in the covenant of works." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Redemptive History**
    - There is continuity between Adam’s probation and Christ’s work, but also significant discontinuity due to sin.
    - The principle of **federal headship** remains, but the context shifts from innocence to redemption.
    - The eschatological hope remains unchanged, though now realized through Christ.
    - The structure of redemptive history is covenantal and eschatological from the beginning.
    - "Redemptive history is structured by the movement from creation to consummation, a movement initiated in Adam and fulfilled in Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **eschatological orientation** of the covenant of works has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the nature of Adam’s probation and the ultimate destiny of humanity. His emphasis on the **federal relationship** between Adam and Christ has reinforced the centrality of union with Christ in Reformed soteriology. Gaffin’s work continues to influence systematic and biblical theologians, particularly in understanding the relationship between creation, fall, and consummation. His legacy is marked by a robust integration of biblical theology with classic Reformed categories.
