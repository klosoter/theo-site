### TITLE
Probation, Glory, and Eschatology: The Hypothetical History of an Unfallen Adam

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How God’s original covenantal design with Adam, including **probation**, **eschatological elevation**, and **federal representation**, would have unfolded had Adam not sinned, and what this reveals about nature, grace, and the work of Christ.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Francis Turretin, Herman Bavinck, Geerhardus Vos.
- Relevant traditions: Augustinian doctrine of original righteousness, medieval nature–grace discussions, Reformed **federal theology** and covenant theology, with attention to post-Reformation scholastics and neo-Calvinist developments.
- Debates:
  - Internal: nature of the covenant of works, conditionality and merit, whether Adam was already in a state of grace, the character of the eschatological goal.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian denials of federal representation, modern rejection of historical Adam and of **covenantal probation**, Roman Catholic critiques of Reformed merit language.
  - Contemporary: Christological uniqueness if Adam could have attained glory, human destiny and **beatific vision**, evolutionary accounts of human origins, and analytic worries about counterfactuals in providence.
- Defended position: Adam was created in original righteousness under a **covenant of works** with a real probation and a higher eschatological end; had he not sinned, he and his posterity would have been confirmed in immutable righteousness and glorified communion with God through a prelapsarian, non-redemptive divine condescension, while Christ’s mediatorial work as incarnate Redeemer would not have been historically enacted.

### ESSAY
To ask what would have happened if Adam had not sinned is not to indulge speculative curiosity detached from Scripture, but to clarify the structure of God’s original covenant with humanity, the relation of creation to consummation, and the unique necessity and character of Christ’s mediatorial work after the fall. The question forces precision on three doctrinal fronts: first, the nature of Adam’s original state and its teleology; second, the character of the **covenant of works** or **covenant of life** and its implied counterfactuals; third, the relation between Adam and Christ as federal heads, including whether Christ’s incarnation and mediation are in any sense independent of sin. I will argue that Adam was created in true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, yet as mutable and under probation, ordered toward a higher, confirmed, and glorified state of communion; that God entered into a **covenantal probation** with Adam promising eschatological life upon perfect and personal obedience; and that had Adam obeyed, he and his posterity would have been confirmed in righteousness and glorified in a way analogous in structure, though not in redemptive modality, to the consummation secured by Christ. Under that hypothesis, Christ’s incarnate work as mediator of redemption would not have taken place in history, though the triune God’s purpose of communion with humanity would still be realized.

To locate the question properly, Augustine must come first. Augustine’s mature anti-Pelagian thought, particularly in The City of God and On the Grace of Christ and on Original Sin, gives us the basic grammar. Adam is created posse peccare, posse non peccare, able to sin and able not to sin. Augustine insists on a real **original righteousness**: Adam possessed rectitude of will and ordered loves, not mere neutrality. Yet Augustine is equally insistent that Adam’s state was mutable and therefore not the final goal. He distinguishes between the original possibility of not sinning and the eschatological non posse peccare, the inability to sin granted to the glorified saints. This already implies that creational righteousness is ordered to a higher consummation. When pressed on what would have been the outcome had Adam persevered, Augustine speaks of an increase and confirmation of good, sometimes using language of spiritual progress even prior to any fall. The saints’ final state exceeds Adam’s beginning, and, for Augustine, this is not merely an accident of redemption but reflective of God’s purpose to bring rational creatures to a higher participation in himself.

However, Augustine does not yet articulate a fully formalized **probationary covenant**. He clearly sees Adam as the root of humanity, so that his sin is imputed to his posterity, an early form of **federal representation**. He is also clear that there was a divine command attached to life and death. But Augustine tends to assimilate the structure into his broader themes of grace and predestination rather than describing a discrete covenant of works. Moreover, he is careful not to speak of strict condign merit before God. God’s reward of good works in any state is always, for Augustine, a crowning of his own gifts of grace. So an examiner may ask: Does Augustine give you enough resources to speak of a covenant of works in which Adam could, in some sense, have “merited” life for himself and his progeny? The answer is nuanced. Augustine gives us the teleological and federal structure: a mutable righteousness ordered to higher, confirmed life, with Adam acting as root of humanity under a divine command of life and death. But the later Reformed concept of covenantal merit requires further development beyond Augustine’s explicit categories, even if it harmonizes with his insistence that any reward is grounded in God’s prior gift.

Thomas Aquinas represents a second decisive moment, particularly in the Summa Theologiae in his treatment of the state of innocence. Aquinas brings to this question his nature–grace framework and a highly articulated account of human teleology toward God. For Thomas, Adam is created in a state of original justice, which is a supernatural gift harmonizing the faculties under reason and orienting man toward God as his final end. He introduces the notion of preternatural gifts such as immortality and impassibility granted to Adam. Crucially, Thomas holds that the ultimate end of human beings is the **beatific vision**, a direct intellectual vision of the divine essence. That end, for Thomas, is not proportionate to created nature and so always requires grace as a supernatural elevation. In the state of innocence, man possessed habitual grace enabling him to merit an increase of grace and, ultimately, the beatific vision. Thomas therefore does imagine a kind of progress and elevation even apart from sin.

This Thomistic framework forces a question: Was Adam’s possible advancement intrinsically dependent on supernatural grace in the same way that the post-fall believer’s is, or is there a distinct mode of divine condescension prior to sin? Thomas tends to collapse this distinction: for him, Adam already stands in what Reformed theology would call a covenant of grace structure, since his original justice is by infused grace ordered to the same supernatural end of the beatific vision. The so-called covenant of works is not really a separate economy. An examiner will likely press you here: Do you accept Thomas’s identification of Adam’s eschatological end with the beatific vision by supernatural grace, or do you insist on a distinct prelapsarian arrangement? My own position, with the classic Reformed, is that there is genuine overlap but also a real covenantal distinction. I agree with Thomas that humanity’s ultimate end is a form of **beatific vision**, a direct and unmediated communion with God surpassing creational proportion. But I maintain that God’s arrangement with Adam was a distinct, non-redemptive **divine condescension**, freely promising consummation upon obedience without presupposing sin or its remedy. In this sense, I do not adopt the Thomistic tendency to speak of Adam as already in a covenant of grace, even though any eschatological reward would still be a gift grounded in God’s generosity rather than strict condign merit.

The Reformed scholastics, and among them Francis Turretin, give classical articulation to this structure. Turretin’s Institutes of Elenctic Theology offers one of the most careful expositions of the **covenant of works**. For Turretin, God created Adam righteous yet mutable, endowed with the law written on his heart and a positive command regarding the tree of knowledge. This is not a bare natural relationship but a covenant, a voluntary arrangement in which God promises life upon condition of perfect and personal obedience, threatening death upon transgression. Turretin is explicit that this life is more than mere continuance in Edenic conditions; it involves confirmation in righteousness and, implicitly, an elevation beyond mutability. Here the Reformed system codifies what was more implicit in Augustine. Turretin also clarifies the mode of Adam’s relation to his posterity: Adam stands as a **federal head**, such that his obedience or disobedience is legally and covenantally imputed to those he represents.

The key, examiner-level issue is Turretin’s language of “merit” in Adam’s covenant. Reformed orthodoxy is divided algorithmically here. Some, like Turretin, speak of a kind of covenant merit, of congruity rather than strict condignity. God freely promises to reward Adam’s obedience with life, and, by virtue of that promise, one can say that Adam’s obedience would merit the reward. Others are more hesitant, preferring to avoid merit language altogether lest it impinge on God’s freedom and generosity. Turretin carefully maintains that Adam’s possible merit is of a different order from Christ’s. Adam’s work would never be condign in the strict sense, since the distance between Creator and creature forbids any proportionate obligating of God. Christ’s merit, on the other hand, is of infinite value because of the dignity of his divine person, and it addresses the problem of sin. Thus, even if Adam had obeyed, the glory bestowed would still be a covenantal gift, not something God was strictly bound to by justice apart from his own promise.

If we pursue Turretin’s line, what would have happened had Adam not sinned? Adam, persevering in obedience through his **probation**, would have passed from a state of mutable righteousness to confirmed righteousness, and his posterity, existing in him as their federal head, would share in this confirmed state. There would be no original sin, no death, no curse. The history of humanity would be one of holy cultural development under God, manifesting **common and special grace** only in their creational, not redemptive, forms. There would be eschatological consummation, but no cross. Some examiners might challenge: does this not reduce Christ to a plan B, subordinate to Adam? Turretin’s own structure, when read with the broader Reformed confessional theology, answers by appealing to the distinction between God’s **decretive will** and the order of covenantal economies. In the hidden decree, God eternally wills the fall and redemption in Christ. But in the revealed economy, Adam’s covenant is a real probation with genuine conditionality. The counterfactual, “if Adam had not sinned,” is logically coherent and structurally necessary for understanding the covenant, even though, as a matter of decree, it does not obtain. This is not to make Christ second in divine intention, but to recognize multiple layers of divine willing and the difference between logical and historical order.

Herman Bavinck deepens this picture by emphasizing the eschatological arc of creation and the goodness yet incompleteness of the original state. In his Reformed Dogmatics, Bavinck argues that creation is inherently teleological. Humanity is made in the image of God not merely to remain static in Eden, but to advance toward a higher, sabbatical rest with God. He notes that even before sin, Scripture hints at a goal beyond the garden, symbolized in the tree of life and the unfulfilled mandate to subdue the earth. For Bavinck, this means that the distinction between creation and consummation is not introduced by sin; rather, sin interrupts an already eschatologically oriented creation. Thus, to ask what if Adam had not sinned is to ask what straight-line path from creation to consummation would have looked like.

Bavinck is also important for his handling of the relation between Adam and Christ. He insists on the structural analogy between the first and second Adams as federal heads, while maintaining the surpassing excellence of Christ’s work due to the presence of sin and the hypostatic union. An examiner may cite Bavinck’s openness to the idea that even apart from sin, God could have entered into deeper communion with humanity, perhaps through incarnation. Bavinck indeed entertains the speculative possibility of an incarnation apart from redemption, but treats it with caution. On the position I defend, we should say that Scripture gives no positive warrant to affirm an inevitable incarnation without sin. The analogy of the two Adams in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 tightly binds Christ’s incarnate work to the problem of death and sin. The exaltation Christ secures is not only eschatological but redemptive and restorative. While nothing in God’s absolute power would prevent him from assuming human nature without a fall, the specific Christology revealed in history and attested in Scripture is inextricable from his role as mediator of the **covenant of grace**. So in the counterfactual world of Adam’s obedience, the triune God would consummate humanity’s destiny without the historical economy of the Son’s incarnate humiliation and atonement. The eschatological state would still be one of heightened communion, but its mode would differ from the beatific vision mediated by the crucified and risen Christ as we now know it.

Geerhardus Vos then pushes this to a biblical-theological precision. In his treatment of the covenant of works and the eschatology of the garden, Vos argues that Adam’s probation under the tree of knowledge was a passage-rite toward consummation symbolized in the Sabbath and the tree of life, which he associates with a higher, heavenly life. For Vos, the distinction between **earthly Eden** and **heavenly glory** is not one of sin and grace but of untested and tested righteousness. Adam, under the law of the covenant, stood at the headwaters of a history that, in the path of obedience, would have culminated in a glorified order, perhaps involving a transformation of creation analogous to the new heavens and new earth promised in Christ. Vos thus interprets Christ as the eschatological second Adam who accomplishes what the first failed to do: not merely to restore Eden but to bring humanity to that higher, heavenly Sabbath.

Vos’s exegesis helps answer a critical contemporary objection, often coming from those influenced by modern evolutionary accounts or less historical readings of Genesis: is it coherent to speak of a historical probation with global consequences in a world that emerges through a long, contingent natural history? The Reformed answer, shaped by Vos’s biblical theology, is that Scripture’s own covenantal and genealogical structure presupposes a real Adam standing at the head of humanity, not a symbolic collective. To dissolve Adam into myth or typology alone is to undermine the very federal structure that makes Romans 5 intelligible. Without that federal structure, the counterfactual “if Adam had not sinned” loses contact with biblical categories. It is precisely because Adam is one man through whom death entered that we can understand the one man through whom life and justification come. Evolutionary models that dissolve this historical particularity constitute an external challenge to which a Westminster candidate must respond by defending historical Adam as a non-negotiable element of **federal theology**.

Internal Reformed debates sharpen the contours. One fault line concerns whether the covenant of works is a legitimate biblical category or an unwarranted scholastic overlay. Some modern Reformed voices, wary of merit language and anxious to stress grace from the outset, argue that the Bible speaks only of one covenant of grace, stretching from Adam onward, with law functioning as an administration of grace rather than a distinct covenant of works. If this were correct, the question “what if Adam had not sinned” would receive a different answer: Adam’s obedience, already a fruit of grace, would grow into eschatological glory as a sheer gift without a distinct legal probation. In response, the classic confessional position insists that while God’s benevolence is present from creation, there is a real and formal distinction between a covenant that promises life upon obedience and a covenant that gives life by faith in a Redeemer who has obeyed in our place. To collapse this distinction obscures the structure of law and gospel and undermines the parallel between Adam and Christ in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15. On my view, the covenant of works is biblically warranted as a descriptive synthesis of the testing arrangement in Eden, the curse pronounced in Genesis 3, and Paul’s Adam–Christ typology. It is only within such a covenant that the counterfactual of Adam’s obedience retains theological weight.

Another internal debate concerns the nature of the eschatological goal. Was Adam’s potential reward identical in content to the new creation secured in Christ, or was it a lower, purely earthly perfection? Here some older Reformed voices spoke as if Adam’s reward were essentially prolonged earthly blessedness. Others, especially those influenced by Vos and Bavinck, speak more strongly of a higher **glorification**. I side with the latter: the symbolism of the tree of life, the Sabbath rest in Hebrews, and Paul’s contrast between the natural and spiritual body indicate that the goal for humanity is a transformed, deathless mode of embodied life in the presence of God. Even if we cannot map, point for point, the exact content of this glory in the unfallen scenario, we can say that Adam’s obedience would have led, by divine condescension, to a consummated order without sin or curse, one that shares the essential features of what Revelation describes, apart from its explicitly redemptive dimensions. The difference lies not in destination but in route and ground: with sin, glory is reached only through cross and resurrection; without sin, glory would be reached through unbroken obedience under covenant.

Externally, Pelagian and semi-Pelagian positions challenge the very idea that Adam’s sin has determinative consequences for his posterity beyond bad example. If Adam is merely the first sinner, not a **federal head**, then the question “what if Adam had not sinned” reduces to “what if no one had sinned until much later,” a drastically different counterfactual. Augustine’s and the Reformed insistence on imputation responds that God has ordered humanity corporately under representative heads. This ordering is not arbitrary tyranny but covenantal solidarity. The fairness objection, common in contemporary moral sensibilities, can be turned back: apart from federal representation, you also lose the possibility that the obedience of one man, Christ, can count for the many. The same structure that makes the first Adam’s disobedience devastating makes the second Adam’s obedience saving. Thus, federal representation is not a dispensable, problematic device but intrinsic to the gospel’s logic. Under this framework, the non-sin of Adam would not only have meant his own blessedness but the confirmed righteousness of all descending from him.

Contemporary analytic theology sometimes raises worries about counterfactuals and divine providence: if God decrees that Adam will sin, in what sense is it meaningful to speak of a world in which Adam does not sin? Here one must distinguish logical possibility, covenantal conditionality, and decreed actuality. The statement “if Adam obeys, then he will live” is a genuine conditional built into the covenant. It expresses the moral and legal structure of Adam’s relation to God. From the standpoint of God’s decree, that antecedent is never actualized, but that does not empty the conditional of content. It still informs our understanding of God’s justice, the meaning of Christ’s obedience, and the nature of eschatological reward. The counterfactual serves a dogmatic function even if, in God’s omniscience, it is known never to be realized.

Finally, the uniqueness of Christ must be clearly guarded. A common examiner question is: if Adam could have brought humanity to glory apart from sin, does that not relativize Christ’s supremacy? The answer is that Christ’s supremacy is not simply that he brings humans to glory, but that he does so as the eternal Son incarnate, conquering sin and death and revealing the depths of divine love and justice. Adam, even in perfect obedience, would have been a creaturely, non-incarnate mediator of a covenantal blessing, not the incarnate Lord uniting divinity and humanity. Moreover, according to the actual decree of God made known in Scripture, Christ is the alpha and omega, the one in whom and for whom all things were created. Whatever hypothetical could be imagined about Adam’s obedience must be subordinated to the actual history in which Christ, not Adam, stands as the central figure of God’s purposes. The question “what if Adam had not sinned” thus serves not to diminish Christ but to highlight that the second Adam accomplishes both what the first failed to do, and more besides, turning the catastrophe of the fall into the occasion for a yet more glorious revelation of God’s grace.

In sum, to answer responsibly what would have happened if Adam had not sinned, one must affirm, with Augustine, the teleological ordering of mutable righteousness to confirmed holiness; with Aquinas, the supernaturally elevated character of humanity’s final end in something like a **beatific vision**; with Turretin and the Reformed scholastics, the formal structure of a **covenant of works** with real probation and federal consequences; with Bavinck, the eschatological orientation of creation itself; and with Vos, the biblical-theological pattern of two Adams and the garden’s inherent eschatology. On this consolidated basis, the most coherent position is that God entered into a covenantal probation with Adam, promising eschatological life upon obedience; that had Adam obeyed, he and his seed would have been confirmed in righteousness and glorified; that this consummation would have occurred through divine condescension apart from sin, not through incarnate mediation and atonement; and that the actual history of the fall and redemption in Christ reflects not the failure of God’s original plan but the deeper, eternal counsel of the triune God to reveal his grace and justice in the crucified and risen second Adam.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The question “what if Adam had not sinned” concerns the counterfactual outcome of Adam’s **covenantal probation** under the **covenant of works**, clarifying the eschatological goal of humanity, the nature of **federal representation**, and the relation between creation and consummation apart from sin.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: mutable original righteousness ordered to a higher, confirmed state; Adam as root of humanity; no fully formal covenant of works but its basic structure implicit.
  - Thomas Aquinas: state of innocence with original justice and preternatural gifts; humanity’s ultimate end in **beatific vision** by supernatural grace; tends to see Adam already in a grace-structure, not a distinct covenant of works.
  - Francis Turretin: explicit **covenant of works** with probation, promise of life, and federal headship; cautious use of covenantal “merit” distinguished sharply from Christ’s condign merit.
  - Herman Bavinck: creation inherently eschatological; original state good but incomplete; structural analogy yet redemptive superiority of the second Adam.
  - Geerhardus Vos: biblical-theological reading of Eden as eschatological; Adam’s obedience would have led from earthly Eden to heavenly glory; Christ as the eschatological second Adam.
- Debates:
  - Internal: legitimacy and structure of the covenant of works, use of merit language, content of Adam’s eschatological reward, whether Adam’s arrangement is distinct from the covenant of grace.
  - External: Pelagian denial of imputed guilt and righteousness, Roman Catholic critique of Reformed merit language and insistence on grace from the outset, modern denials of historical Adam and federal representation.
  - Contemporary: coherence of counterfactuals under divine decree, evolutionary challenges to a single historical Adam, speculation about incarnation without sin and its relation to Christ’s uniqueness.
- Defended position: Adam was created in true original righteousness yet mutable, placed under a real **covenant of works** with probation and federal headship; had he obeyed, he and his posterity would have been confirmed in righteousness and glorified in consummated communion with God by divine condescension apart from sin, and the incarnate, redemptive mediation of Christ as historically revealed would not have taken place.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Did Adam stand in grace or only in nature under the covenant of works?  
    Answer: He stood under a gracious divine condescension promising eschatological life, but not yet under the redemptive **covenant of grace**.
  - Could Adam truly “merit” eschatological life?  
    Answer: Only in a covenantal sense based on God’s promise, not in strict condign merit that would obligate God apart from his free condescension.
  - Would Adam’s reward have been equal to the glory secured by Christ?  
    Answer: Essentially yes in eschatological communion and glorification, but without the redemptive and incarnational depth revealed in Christ’s victory over sin and death.
  - Is the covenant of works biblically warranted?  
    Answer: Yes, as a synthesis of the probation and sanctions of Genesis 2–3 and the Adam–Christ parallel in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15.
  - Does this counterfactual make Christ secondary in God’s plan?  
    Answer: No; in the decree Christ is first and central, while covenantally Adam’s probation is a real but never actualized condition whose failure occasions the historical revelation of Christ’s mediatorial glory.
