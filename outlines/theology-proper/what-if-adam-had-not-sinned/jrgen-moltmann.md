# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches Adam’s hypothetical obedience through a deeply **eschatological** and **Christocentric** lens, moving away from traditional speculation about a **covenant of works** or a fixed **prelapsarian state**. He reframes the question in terms of humanity’s vocation toward **theosis** and participation in **God’s coming kingdom**, emphasizing the openness of creation to the future of God.

- "The creation is not finished; it is destined for the kingdom of glory." (The Coming of God)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- God in Creation: A New Theology of Creation and the Spirit of God (1985)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Orientation of Creation**
    - Creation is fundamentally oriented toward its future fulfillment in **God’s kingdom**.
    - The original state of Adam is not a static perfection but an open-ended journey.
    - Human history is shaped by hope and anticipation, not mere restoration.
    - The question "What if Adam had not sinned?" is reframed as "What is humanity’s destiny in God?"
    - "Creation is not a closed system, but is open to the future of God." (God in Creation)

2. **Christocentric Anthropology**
    - Humanity’s true image is revealed in **Jesus Christ**, not merely in Adam.
    - Adam’s obedience or disobedience is relativized by the incarnation and resurrection.
    - The human vocation is fulfilled in Christ’s obedience, not Adam’s hypothetical innocence.
    - The new humanity is constituted in Christ, who is the eschatological Adam.
    - "The true image of God is not Adam, but the risen Christ." (The Coming of God)

3. **Rejection of a Static Covenant of Works**
    - Moltmann does not affirm a traditional **covenant of works** as a fixed legal arrangement.
    - The relationship between God and humanity is dynamic and dialogical.
    - Obedience is not about maintaining a status quo but about responding to God’s call into the future.
    - The law is always oriented toward liberation and fulfillment, not mere probation.
    - "God’s covenant is always a promise of the future, not a contract for the present." (Experiences in Theology)

4. **Theosis and Human Participation**
    - Humanity is called to **participate** in God’s life, moving toward **theosis**.
    - Adam’s original calling is not lost but transformed and fulfilled in Christ.
    - The possibility of not sinning is realized eschatologically, not hypothetically.
    - Human destiny is union with God, not simply moral innocence.
    - "The goal of creation is the indwelling of God in all things." (God in Creation)

5. **Redemptive History over Hypothetical Alternatives**
    - Moltmann prioritizes the actual history of **redemption** over speculative scenarios.
    - The fall is not merely a failure but the context for God’s greater act of new creation.
    - The question of Adam’s obedience is subsumed under the broader narrative of **salvation history**.
    - God’s purposes are realized through history, not in abstract possibilities.
    - "God’s history with the world is a history of promise and fulfillment, not of lost opportunities." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach has shifted the discussion from **prelapsarian speculation** to a robustly **eschatological** and **Christ-centered** vision of human destiny. His theology has influenced contemporary discussions on **creation, hope, and the future of humanity** by emphasizing participation in God’s unfolding kingdom rather than restoration of an original state. Moltmann’s reframing of Adam’s role continues to challenge traditional Reformed categories and inspire constructive theological reflection on the meaning of salvation and new creation.
