# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached the question of Adam’s hypothetical obedience through the framework of **Covenant Theology**, particularly the **Covenant of Works**. He argued that had Adam not sinned, he would have attained **eschatological life**—a higher, confirmed state beyond mere innocence—by fulfilling the probationary command. Vos emphasized that the original creation order was inherently **eschatological**, pointing to a consummation that Adam could have reached through obedience.

- "The tree of life was the sacramental pledge of a higher, unchangeable life to be secured by obedience." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Eschatological**
    - The **Covenant of Works** was not merely about maintaining innocence but about attaining a higher, confirmed life.
    - Adam’s obedience would have led to a consummate, **eschatological state**.
    - The probation was temporary, with the promise of advancement beyond probation.
    - The **tree of life** symbolized the reward of confirmed righteousness.
    - "The covenant of works had as its goal not the perpetuation of the status quo, but the attainment of a higher, unlosable life." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Probation and Conditionality**
    - Adam was placed under a probationary command as a representative head.
    - The outcome of history hinged on Adam’s obedience or disobedience.
    - The **conditional promise** was real, not hypothetical.
    - Adam’s success would have secured blessings for all his posterity.
    - "Adam stood at the head of the race as its representative, and his probation was theirs." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Eschatological Orientation of Creation**
    - Creation itself was oriented toward a future consummation, not static perfection.
    - The **eschatological goal** was built into the created order from the beginning.
    - Adam’s task was to move creation toward its intended telos.
    - The **Sabbath** pointed to the rest and fulfillment awaiting obedience.
    - "The world was created with its goal before it, not behind it." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Typology and the Second Adam**
    - Adam’s role prefigured Christ, the **Second Adam**, who secures what Adam failed to obtain.
    - The structure of the **Covenant of Works** sets the pattern for the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Christ’s obedience fulfills the original eschatological promise.
    - The typology underscores the unity of redemptive history.
    - "The first Adam failed, but the Second Adam brings the eschatological life to fulfillment." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Sacramental Significance of the Tree of Life**
    - The **tree of life** was a sacramental sign of the higher life promised to Adam.
    - Participation in the tree was contingent on obedience.
    - The tree pointed beyond itself to the reality of **eternal life**.
    - Its presence in Eden revealed the gracious character of the covenant.
    - "The tree of life was the visible pledge of the eschatological hope." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **eschatological dimension** of the Covenant of Works profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology. His insights clarified that Adam’s original state was not the intended end, but a stage pointing forward to consummation. By rooting the drama of redemption in the structure of the covenants, Vos provided a framework that has influenced generations of Reformed theologians and biblical scholars. His work remains foundational for understanding the relationship between creation, covenant, and eschatology.
