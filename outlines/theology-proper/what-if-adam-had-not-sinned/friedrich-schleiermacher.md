# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the question of Adam’s hypothetical obedience through his distinctive lens of **religious consciousness** and the **God-consciousness** inherent in humanity. He reframed traditional doctrines of **original sin** and **the Fall**, emphasizing the development of human self-consciousness rather than a historical or forensic account of Adam’s state. For Schleiermacher, the significance of Adam’s possible non-sin lies in the unfolding of **humanity’s God-relatedness** rather than in a lost state of **original righteousness**.

- "The doctrine of original sin is not to be understood as a historical account of a first sin, but as an expression of the universal condition of human consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §71)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sin as Universal Human Condition**
   - Sin is not merely an act but a state present in all human consciousness.
   - The universality of sin is rooted in the structure of human nature, not in a single historical event.
   - Adam’s sin is representative, not causative, of the human condition.
   - The question of Adam’s obedience is secondary to the reality of sin’s universality.
   - "Sin is found wherever the God-consciousness is not the dominant element in self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §71)

2. **God-Consciousness as Defining Humanity**
   - Humanity’s essence is its capacity for God-consciousness.
   - The Fall represents a disruption in the development of this consciousness.
   - If Adam had not sinned, the God-consciousness would have developed without hindrance.
   - The possibility of sin is inherent in finite consciousness, not merely in Adam’s choice.
   - "The God-consciousness is the distinguishing feature of the human spirit." (The Christian Faith, §4)

3. **Rejection of Forensic Imputation**
   - Schleiermacher denies the traditional Reformed view of imputed guilt from Adam.
   - He interprets original sin as a shared existential reality, not a legal status.
   - Adam’s hypothetical obedience would not have established a legal righteousness for all.
   - The focus is on the actual state of humanity, not on counterfactuals.
   - "The doctrine of imputation is foreign to the true nature of religious self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §71)

4. **Christ as the True Ideal**
   - Christ, not Adam, is the true archetype of humanity.
   - The perfection of God-consciousness is realized in Christ, not in a hypothetical sinless Adam.
   - Redemption is the restoration and fulfillment of what Adam’s state only anticipated.
   - The question of Adam’s obedience is overshadowed by the reality of Christ’s achievement.
   - "In Christ, the God-consciousness is absolutely dominant and unbroken." (The Christian Faith, §94)

5. **Historical Development over Static State**
   - Human history is a process of developing God-consciousness.
   - The Fall is a necessary stage in this development, not merely a tragic loss.
   - Adam’s non-sin would have meant a different path, but not the absence of development.
   - Schleiermacher emphasizes the dynamic, historical unfolding of religious life.
   - "The history of humanity is the history of the development of the God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §60)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **original sin** and the state of Adam shifted the focus from forensic categories to the dynamics of **religious consciousness**. His approach influenced modern theology’s move away from speculative counterfactuals about Adam toward the existential realities of human nature and redemption. By centering the discussion on **God-consciousness** and the person of Christ, Schleiermacher laid groundwork for later liberal and existential theologies, challenging traditional Reformed emphases on covenant and imputation.
