# Three Forms of Unity (1618–1619)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed federal theology** regarding Adam’s original state. They teach that Adam was created in **original righteousness** and placed under a **covenant of works** with the promise of **eternal life** upon obedience. Had Adam not sinned, humanity would have inherited this blessed state, but his fall brought the necessity of **redemption in Christ**.

- "God created man good and after His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him, and live with Him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise Him." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 6)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Articles 14–17
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Days 3–6
- Canons of Dort, Head I, Articles 1–2
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Beeke & Ferguson)
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. Dennison)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam’s Original Righteousness**
    - Adam was created in the **image of God**, possessing true righteousness and holiness.
    - He had the natural ability to know, love, and serve God.
    - This original state was not neutral but positively oriented toward God.
    - Adam’s righteousness was the foundation for his covenantal relationship with God.
    - "God created man good and after His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness..." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 6)

2. **Covenant of Works**
    - Adam was placed under a covenantal arrangement requiring perfect obedience.
    - The promise of **eternal life** was conditioned on Adam’s obedience.
    - The threat of death was attached to disobedience.
    - This covenant was distinct from the later **covenant of grace**.
    - "God had made a covenant with him: on condition of obedience he was to receive eternal life, but on condition of disobedience, death." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

3. **Potential for Eternal Blessedness**
    - If Adam had not sinned, he and his posterity would have entered into eternal life.
    - The state of innocence was probationary, not the final goal.
    - Adam’s obedience would have secured an unlosable blessedness for humanity.
    - The **eschatological hope** was present from creation, not only after the fall.
    - "If he had remained in this state, he would have enjoyed eternal happiness with God." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 6)

4. **Transmission of Adam’s State**
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity.
    - His obedience or disobedience would affect all his descendants.
    - Had he obeyed, his righteousness would have been imputed to his posterity.
    - The fall resulted in the transmission of sin and death instead.
    - "By the disobedience of Adam, original sin is extended to all mankind..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

5. **Necessity of Redemption after the Fall**
    - Adam’s failure made the **covenant of grace** necessary for salvation.
    - The confessions contrast Adam’s potential obedience with Christ’s actual obedience.
    - Redemption in Christ restores what was lost and brings greater blessings.
    - The work of Christ is seen as fulfilling what Adam failed to do.
    - "We are delivered from our misery by the only Mediator, Jesus Christ, who restores us to favor with God." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 18)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped **Reformed covenant theology**, especially the doctrines of the **covenant of works** and federal headship. Their teaching on Adam’s original state and the hypothetical outcome of his obedience has influenced generations of confessional Reformed churches and theologians. These confessions continue to serve as foundational standards for understanding the relationship between creation, fall, and redemption within the Reformed tradition.
