# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin taught that if Adam had not sinned, humanity would have continued in a state of **original righteousness**, ultimately attaining **eternal life** through obedience to the **covenant of works**. Calvin emphasized that Adam’s probation was a real test, and that the promise of **immortality** was genuinely offered, contingent on perfect obedience, though always by God’s gracious condescension.

- "He was created in such a condition that, if he had chosen, he could by persevering have attained to the immortality of which he was capable." (Institutes 2.1.4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Real Arrangement**
    - God entered into a **covenant of works** with Adam, promising life for obedience.
    - The arrangement was not natural necessity but a gracious condescension.
    - Adam’s obedience was the condition for attaining **eternal life**.
    - The threat of death and promise of life were both real and binding.
    - "God made man in his own image, and entered into covenant with him, promising life if he obeyed, and threatening death if he transgressed." (Institutes 2.1.3)

2. **Original Righteousness and Ability**
    - Adam was endowed with **original righteousness** and true knowledge.
    - He possessed the ability to obey God’s law perfectly.
    - This state was mutable—Adam could fall, but also could persevere.
    - Adam’s will was genuinely free before the fall.
    - "Adam might have stood if he chose, seeing he fell solely by his own will." (Institutes 2.1.4)

3. **Conditional Immortality**
    - Immortality was not inherent but promised upon obedience.
    - The tree of life symbolized the reward of **eternal life** for faithfulness.
    - Adam’s continued obedience would have led to a confirmed state of blessedness.
    - Death was only a possibility if Adam disobeyed.
    - "The tree of life was to Adam a pledge that he would not be disappointed of immortality, if only he continued obedient." (Commentary on Genesis 2:9)

4. **Divine Sovereignty and Providence**
    - God’s decree encompassed Adam’s probation and possible perseverance.
    - Even the hypothetical of Adam’s obedience would be under God’s sovereign will.
    - Human freedom in the garden was real but always subordinate to divine providence.
    - God’s purpose in the covenant was to display both justice and grace.
    - "Nothing happens but what is knowingly and willingly decreed by Him." (Institutes 1.16.3)

5. **Typology and Christological Fulfillment**
    - Adam’s probation prefigured Christ’s obedience as the second Adam.
    - The **covenant of works** sets the stage for the **covenant of grace**.
    - Christ achieves what Adam failed to do, securing eternal life for the elect.
    - The hypothetical of Adam’s obedience highlights the necessity and sufficiency of Christ’s work.
    - "For as Adam’s ruin involved us all in eternal death, so Christ’s righteousness has restored us to life." (Institutes 2.1.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of the **covenant of works** and the possibility of Adam’s perseverance shaped later **Reformed federal theology**. His emphasis on the real offer of eternal life through obedience, and the typological connection to Christ, provided a foundation for understanding the relationship between law and gospel. Calvin’s careful distinction between Adam’s mutable state and the confirmed state offered in Christ remains influential in discussions of **original righteousness** and the nature of human freedom before the fall.
