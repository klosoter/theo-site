# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of the **Covenant of Works**, teaching that Adam was placed in a probationary state with the promise of **eternal life** upon perfect, personal obedience. They emphasize the federal relationship between Adam and his posterity, the distinction between Adam’s original mutable righteousness and the **confirmed righteousness** that would have resulted from obedience, and the necessity of Christ as the second Adam after the Fall.

- "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to Adam; and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Probationary**
    - Adam was placed under a **covenant of works** with a specific command from God.
    - The covenant entailed a period of probation, after which reward or punishment would follow.
    - Adam’s obedience would have secured a higher, immutable state for himself and his descendants.
    - The probationary nature distinguishes Adam’s original state from the final state of glory.
    "The condition of the covenant of works was perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience." (WLC Q.20)

2. **Promise of Life upon Obedience**
    - The covenant held out the promise of **eternal life** as a reward for obedience.
    - This life was not mere continuation, but a confirmed, glorified state.
    - The tree of life symbolized this promise of consummate blessing.
    - Adam’s obedience would have led to the irreversible enjoyment of God.
    "Life was promised to Adam; and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience." (WCF 7.2)

3. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam acted as a **federal head** for all humanity.
    - His obedience or disobedience would be imputed to his posterity.
    - The destiny of the human race was bound up with Adam’s covenantal role.
    - This federal principle is foundational for understanding both condemnation in Adam and salvation in Christ.
    "The covenant being made with Adam as a public person, not for himself only, but for his posterity, all mankind... sinned in him, and fell with him." (WSC Q.16)

4. **Distinction between Original and Glorified State**
    - Adam’s original righteousness was mutable and could be lost.
    - The reward for obedience was a higher, immutable state of **confirmed righteousness**.
    - The original state was one of innocence, not consummate glory.
    - The Standards distinguish between creation and the eschatological goal.
    "Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom and power to will and to do that which was good and well pleasing to God; but yet mutably, so that he might fall from it." (WCF 9.2)

5. **Necessity of Christ after the Fall**
    - After Adam’s failure, the **Covenant of Grace** becomes necessary for salvation.
    - Christ, as the second Adam, fulfills the obedience Adam failed to render.
    - The Standards contrast the two Adams to highlight the sufficiency of Christ’s work.
    - The hypothetical of Adam’s obedience underscores the necessity and sufficiency of Christ’s mediation.
    "The covenant of grace was made with Christ as the second Adam, and in him with all the elect as his seed." (WLC Q.31)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped the **Reformed doctrine of the covenants**, especially the understanding of the **Covenant of Works** and its implications for the history of redemption. Their articulation of Adam’s probation and the promise of eternal life upon obedience has influenced generations of theologians and catechisms. The Standards’ federal theology remains foundational for discussions of original sin, imputation, and the work of Christ as the second Adam. Their clear distinction between Adam’s original state and the eschatological goal continues to inform Reformed soteriology and anthropology.
