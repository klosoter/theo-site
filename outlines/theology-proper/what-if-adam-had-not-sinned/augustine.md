# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s reflections on the question, "What if Adam had not sinned?", are rooted in his doctrines of **original righteousness**, **free will**, and the **order of creation**. He maintained that Adam was created with the genuine possibility of **perseverance** and **eternal blessedness**, but that the **fall** was not necessary; had Adam remained obedient, he would have been confirmed in **immortality** and **beatific communion** with God.

- "If man had not sinned, he would not have been separated from the blessedness of immortality." (City of God, XIII.23)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- City of God (especially Books XII–XIV)
- On the Literal Meaning of Genesis
- On Free Choice of the Will
- Enchiridion

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Righteousness and Conditional Immortality**
    - Adam was created in a state of **original righteousness** with the capacity for obedience.
    - Immortality was a gift, not intrinsic to human nature, but conditionally granted.
    - Adam’s continued obedience would have led to the confirmation of this immortality.
    - The possibility of not sinning (posse non peccare) was real, but not guaranteed.
    - "God made man upright, and if he had willed to stand, he would have remained in blessedness." (City of God, XIV.13)

2. **Free Will and the Possibility of Perseverance**
    - Adam possessed true **free will** before the fall.
    - This freedom included both the ability to sin and the ability not to sin.
    - Perseverance was possible but not secured apart from God’s sustaining grace.
    - The fall was not inevitable; Adam could have chosen continued obedience.
    - "He was able to stand, if he had willed; but he was not able to stand without the help of Him who gave the will." (City of God, XIV.13)

3. **The Order of Creation and Human Destiny**
    - Creation was ordered toward **communion with God** and eternal life.
    - Adam’s obedience would have led to a higher state of **beatitude**.
    - The original order included the potential for humanity’s elevation without death.
    - The fall disrupted, but did not abolish, God’s ultimate purpose for humanity.
    - "If they had remained steadfast in obedience, they would have been raised to a better state." (City of God, XIV.26)

4. **Grace as Both Preventive and Perfecting**
    - Even in the state of innocence, Adam needed **divine grace** to persevere.
    - Grace was not only restorative after the fall but also preventive before it.
    - Human will alone was insufficient for eternal perseverance.
    - The necessity of grace underscores the Creator-creature distinction.
    - "The help of God was necessary for man, even in Paradise, that he might continue in the good." (On the Literal Meaning of Genesis, XI.41)

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Original Purpose**
    - The incarnation and redemption in Christ are not merely remedies but fulfill the original design.
    - Christ secures for the redeemed what Adam could have attained by obedience.
    - The **beatific vision** and eternal life are realized in Christ for the elect.
    - The fall made grace necessary for all, but the end goal remains unchanged.
    - "What we lost in Adam, we recover in Christ, and more abundantly." (Enchiridion, 34)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s treatment of Adam’s possible perseverance shaped Western doctrines of **original sin**, **free will**, and the necessity of **grace**. His nuanced distinction between the state of innocence and the state of glory influenced both medieval and Reformation theology. Later debates on the **covenant of works** and the nature of prelapsarian humanity often drew on Augustine’s insights, making his thought foundational for subsequent Christian anthropology and soteriology.
