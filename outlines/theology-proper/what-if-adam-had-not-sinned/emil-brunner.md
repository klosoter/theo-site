# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the question of Adam’s hypothetical obedience through his **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the existential nature of **human freedom** and the relational character of **original righteousness**. For Brunner, the possibility of Adam not sinning is inseparable from the reality of **human responsibility** and the divine intention for genuine **communion with God**, rather than a mere legalistic probation. He rejected speculative accounts of a "covenant of works," focusing instead on the dynamic, personal relationship between God and humanity.

- "The story of the Fall is not a myth, but the myth is the form in which the truth about man is expressed." (Man in Revolt)

## Key Works

- Man in Revolt (Der Mensch im Widerspruch)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter
- The Mediator

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Freedom as Essential to the Imago Dei**
    - Humanity’s original state is defined by the freedom to respond to God.
    - Adam’s obedience or disobedience is a genuine existential possibility, not a predetermined outcome.
    - The image of God involves the capacity for responsible decision.
    - The fall is not necessary, but a tragic misuse of freedom.
    - "Freedom is the presupposition of responsibility, and responsibility is the presupposition of sin." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Relational Nature of Original Righteousness**
    - Adam’s righteousness is not a static possession but a dynamic relationship with God.
    - Obedience would have meant ongoing trust and openness to God’s Word.
    - The possibility of not sinning is grounded in continual dependence on God.
    - Original righteousness is not an autonomous moral quality.
    - "The right relationship to God is not a possession, but a task and a demand." (Man in Revolt)

3. **Rejection of the Covenant of Works**
    - Brunner denies a formal prelapsarian covenant of works as found in Reformed orthodoxy.
    - He sees the Genesis narrative as existential rather than contractual.
    - The focus is on encounter and response, not legal probation.
    - The idea of meriting eternal life through obedience is foreign to Brunner’s theology.
    - "The so-called covenant of works is a construction foreign to the biblical witness." (Dogmatics II)

4. **Sin as Disruption of Divine-Human Encounter**
    - Sin is fundamentally the breakdown of relationship, not just legal transgression.
    - If Adam had not sinned, the divine-human encounter would have continued in unbroken fellowship.
    - The fall introduces alienation, but not an ontological change in human nature.
    - The possibility of not sinning is always present in authentic encounter.
    - "Sin is the refusal of the divine claim, the breaking off of the encounter." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment, Not Merely the Remedy**
    - Christ is not simply a response to the fall, but the goal of creation from the beginning.
    - Even without sin, humanity’s destiny is realized in communion with God through Christ.
    - The Incarnation is not contingent solely on Adam’s disobedience.
    - Brunner sees Christ as the archetype of true humanity, not just the Redeemer.
    - "Christ is the meaning of creation, not merely its repair." (Dogmatics II)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to the question of Adam’s possible obedience shifted the discussion from **legal categories** to existential and relational dynamics, influencing later existential and neo-orthodox theology. His rejection of the **covenant of works** and emphasis on the **divine-human encounter** challenged traditional Reformed formulations and opened new avenues for understanding human responsibility. Brunner’s thought continues to provoke debate regarding the nature of original righteousness and the theological significance of the fall.
