# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas addressed the question of Adam’s original state and the hypothetical scenario of his perseverance in **original righteousness**. Aquinas maintained that, had Adam not sinned, humanity would have continued in a state of **preternatural gifts**, free from **concupiscence**, **death**, and **ignorance**, and would have been able to attain the **beatific vision** through grace. This scenario underscores Aquinas’s distinction between **nature and grace** and his understanding of the **supernatural end** of humanity.

- "If man had not sinned, he would have begotten children in the state of innocence, for the multiplication of the human race was a part of the blessing of original righteousness." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 98, a. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Righteousness as the Intended State**
    - Adam was created in a state of **original righteousness**, endowed with harmony between reason and passions.
    - This state included the **preternatural gifts**: immortality, integrity, and infused knowledge.
    - Humanity’s natural faculties were ordered toward God, but required grace for the **supernatural end**.
    - The loss of original righteousness resulted in **original sin** and its consequences.
    - "Man was so created that he was both established in grace and also had the possibility of falling." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 95, a. 1)

2. **Nature and Grace Distinction**
    - Human nature, even in innocence, needed **supernatural grace** to attain the **beatific vision**.
    - Adam’s state was not purely natural but elevated by divine gift.
    - The **beatific vision** was not owed to human nature but was a gratuitous end.
    - Grace perfects nature without destroying it.
    - "To see God in His essence is above the nature of every creature." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 12, a. 4)

3. **Propagation of Innocence**
    - Had Adam not sinned, his descendants would have inherited **original righteousness**.
    - The transmission of innocence would have paralleled the actual transmission of **original sin**.
    - The multiplication of the human race would have occurred without lust or disorder.
    - Children would have been born in a state of grace and innocence.
    - "If man had not sinned, children would have been born in original justice." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 100, a. 2)

4. **Absence of Suffering and Death**
    - In the state of innocence, humans would have been free from **bodily death** and suffering.
    - The **preternatural gift** of immortality preserved Adam and his progeny from corruption.
    - Bodily passions would have been perfectly subject to reason.
    - The world would have remained in harmony, without violence or decay.
    - "Death and such like defects were not natural to man, but followed from sin." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 97, a. 1)

5. **Order of Knowledge and Dominion**
    - Adam possessed **infused knowledge** sufficient for his state and vocation.
    - Humanity would have exercised **dominion** over creation in justice and peace.
    - The intellect would have been clear, unclouded by ignorance or error.
    - Human society would have developed in perfect order, guided by reason and grace.
    - "Man in the state of innocence would have possessed perfect knowledge of those things necessary for his state." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 94, a. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s treatment of Adam’s hypothetical perseverance in innocence shaped later **scholastic anthropology** and the doctrine of **original sin**. His distinction between **nature and grace** became foundational for subsequent Catholic theology, influencing debates on the relationship between human nature and the supernatural. Aquinas’s careful articulation of the **preternatural gifts** and their loss provided a framework for understanding both the fall and redemption in Western theology. His synthesis remains a touchstone for discussions on human destiny, the order of creation, and the purpose of grace.
