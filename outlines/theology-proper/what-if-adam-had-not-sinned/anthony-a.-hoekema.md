# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema, a Reformed theologian, addressed the question of Adam’s hypothetical obedience within the framework of **covenant theology** and the **doctrine of humanity**. He emphasized the significance of the **covenant of works**, the **imago Dei**, and the eschatological destiny of humanity, arguing that Adam’s obedience would have led to the consummation of human potential in fellowship with God. Hoekema maintained that the original creation was not static but oriented toward a greater fulfillment in Christ.

- "If Adam had obeyed, he would have entered into a higher state, a state of confirmed righteousness and blessedness." (Created in God's Image)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Eschatological**
   - Adam was placed under a **covenant of works** with the promise of life for obedience.
   - This covenant pointed beyond Eden to a higher, unchangeable state of **confirmed righteousness**.
   - The probationary command was a test of Adam’s loyalty and love for God.
   - The possibility of advancement was inherent in the original creation order.
   - "Adam was created with the possibility of attaining a higher state, but only through obedience." (Created in God's Image)

2. **Imago Dei and Human Destiny**
   - Humanity was created in the **image of God** with a destiny to reflect God’s glory.
   - Adam’s obedience would have led to the full realization of the image in righteousness and holiness.
   - The image of God is dynamic, meant for development and consummation.
   - The fall interrupted, but did not destroy, this divine purpose.
   - "Man was created in the image of God, but this image was to be developed and perfected." (Created in God's Image)

3. **Christ as the True Fulfillment**
   - Even if Adam had not sinned, Christ would have been the center of creation’s consummation.
   - The **second Adam** fulfills what the first Adam failed to achieve.
   - The work of Christ is not merely remedial but brings creation to its intended goal.
   - The eschatological hope is grounded in Christ’s obedience and resurrection.
   - "The ultimate goal for man was not Eden, but the new heaven and new earth in Christ." (The Bible and the Future)

4. **Original Righteousness and Probation**
   - Adam was created in a state of **original righteousness** but not yet in a state of confirmed blessedness.
   - The probationary command was a real test with real consequences.
   - Obedience would have secured eternal life and unbreakable fellowship with God.
   - Disobedience brought death and the need for redemption.
   - "Adam’s original righteousness was mutable; it could be lost or confirmed." (Created in God's Image)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective**
   - The history of redemption unfolds God’s original purpose for humanity.
   - The fall did not thwart God’s plan but redirected it through redemption in Christ.
   - The consummation of all things is the realization of what Adam’s obedience would have secured.
   - The new creation surpasses Eden, fulfilling the original design.
   - "Redemption is the restoration and fulfillment of what was intended from the beginning." (The Bible and the Future)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of the **covenant of works** and the eschatological orientation of creation has shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology and eschatology. His emphasis on the dynamic nature of the **imago Dei** and the centrality of Christ in fulfilling humanity’s destiny continues to influence discussions on the purpose of creation and redemption. Hoekema’s work remains a standard reference for understanding the implications of Adam’s obedience or disobedience within the broader sweep of redemptive history.
