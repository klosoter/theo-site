### ESSAY
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
The question What if Adam had not sinned? belongs to **Theology Proper** insofar as it concerns the **divine decree** and providence, and to **Anthropology** insofar as it treats human nature in *status integritatis* and its eschatological end. Within Reformed dogmatics the counterfactual focuses the **covenant of works** or covenant of life, by which God, in **voluntary condescension**, promised eschatological confirmation to Adam upon perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience. The inquiry also touches **Christology** and the scope of the **Incarnation**: would the Son become incarnate absent sin, or is the Word made flesh conditioned by redemption?

Classically, the prelapsarian state is described by the fourfold Augustinian schema: *posse peccare*, *posse non peccare*, with the prospect of *non posse peccare* as confirmed righteousness. The counterfactual asks whether Adam, had he persevered, would have attained fixed communion and life, and whether his posterity would have shared that life by **federal headship**. It probes whether the **Trinitarian missions** are solely remedial or also consummative, bringing **eschatological Sabbath** to creation.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
Genesis 2 presents the man placed in Eden to serve and guard, with two trees signifying sacramentally the testing and the end: the **tree of the knowledge of good and evil** marks probation, while the **tree of life** signals promised participation in indestructible life. The divine sanction on disobedience, death, implies by **covenantal contrast** the alternative of confirmed life upon obedience. The cherubic barring from the tree of life in Genesis 3:24 indicates the forfeiture of a real eschatological gift, supporting a prelapsarian **covenant of life** rather than mere nature. The Hebrew *berit* does not appear in Genesis 2, yet Hosea 6:7 speaks of Israel transgressing like Adam, invoking **covenantal patterns** from the first man.

Paul reads Adam and Christ as two heads in **Romans 5:12–21** and **1 Corinthians 15:21–49**, framing sin and death versus righteousness and life as federal realities. While these passages treat the actual economy of grace, the antithetical parallel suggests a conceivable Adamic pathway to life. The contrast between the earthy and the heavenly man leaves open whether a heavenly transformation was offered to Adam by divine condescension, an inference strengthened by **eschatological motifs** in Hebrews 2 and Revelation 22 that connect **Sabbath rest** and access to the **tree of life**. The Johannine mission statements do not require sin for the **Incarnation**, yet the Gospels narrate the mission in redemptive terms, which grounds the question rather than settling it.

A separate biblical thread concerns the scope of the **Incarnation**. Ephesians 1:9–10 and Colossians 1:15–20 portray a cosmic anakephalaiosis, the headship of Christ over all. Whether this headship presupposes sin is debated, but the text displays a teleology of all things in the **primacy of Christ**, which Scotists take to ground an incarnation irrespective of the fall, while Thomists argue the doxological end is achieved through redemption.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
For **Augustine** (354–430), humanity in *status integritatis* possessed **original righteousness**, with free will ordered to God yet able to fall. He insists on the gratuity of eschatological life beyond natural powers, anticipating later language of **donum superadditum**, though he does not systematize a formal **covenant of works**. His reflections on the two cities and the Sabbath in City of God imply an eschatological confirmation were Adam to persevere, highlighting **divine benevolence** rather than strict condign merit.

Medieval scholasticism elaborates. **Aquinas** (ST I q95–100; I–II q109–114; III q1 a3, 1265–1274) distinguishes nature and grace with the **preternatural gifts**: immortality, integrity, and infused knowledge. He holds that the **Incarnation** was not absolutely necessary without sin; God could, but there is no fitting necessity. The end of man surpasses nature and is given by grace, so even an unfallen Adam requires **supernatural elevation**, which makes any Adamic merit a matter of **condignity via divine ordination** rather than strict equality. **Bonaventure** entertains a broader Christocentrism, but **Scotus** (c. 1266–1308) articulates the **absolute predestination of Christ**: the Incarnation is primarily willed for the highest glory of God, not as a mere remedy. In Scotus's Ordinatio III, the Word would have become flesh even had Adam not sinned, grounding all creation in the **primacy of Christ**.

The Eastern tradition, especially in **Maximus the Confessor** (c. 580–662), emphasizes **theosis** and the unification of the logoi in the Logos. While Maximus interprets the Incarnation as healing and deifying, strands of Eastern theology suggest the Incarnation as the eternal plan for deification irrespective of the fall, a position later invoked by modern Orthodox thinkers as an alternative to purely remedial models of **salvation history**.

The Reformation reframes the issue covenantally. **Calvin** (Institutes 1559) expounds a **covenant of life** in Eden grounded in **divine condescension**: God promises life beyond nature for obedience, not as Adam's due but by pact. The confessional codification in the **Westminster Confession of Faith (1646–1648)**, especially 7.1–2 and Larger Catechism Q20, speaks of distance between God and creatures surmounted by **voluntary condescension** in covenant. The Reformed largely deny any strict **condign merit** by the creature and insist on the sacramental function of the **tree of life** for eschatological elevation.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
The Westminster standards teach that Adam, as public person under the **covenant of works**, could have attained life for himself and his seed by obedience, by the ordination of God who annexed a promise of life to law. **Old Princeton** theologians such as **Charles Hodge** (Systematic Theology, 1871–1873) and **B. B. Warfield** underscore that this is not Pelagian self-salvation but a **federal arrangement** grounded in **divine benevolence**. Hodge allows the possibility of Adam's confirmation and affirms the **federal transmission** of benefits had he stood.

The **Dutch Neo-Calvinist** stream deepens the eschatological frame. **Herman Bavinck** (Reformed Dogmatics, 1895–1901) argues that creation is ordered to **Sabbath consummation**, and the covenant of works is the appointed means to that end, with the **tree of life** as sacramental pledge. **Geerhardus Vos** (Biblical Theology, 1948) links Adam's task to the movement from earthly Eden to heavenly communion, so that had Adam not sinned, history would still climax in **glorification** by divine gift. On the Incarnation, **Francis Turretin** (Institutes, 1679–1685) is cautious: most likely no Incarnation without sin in the mode of humiliation, though some Reformed permit a hypothetical **incarnation in gloria** as head of humanity apart from atonement. Across the spectrum, Reformed compatibilism holds **divine sovereignty** and true human agency in concert, thereby framing the counterfactual as a real offer under **providence**.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
Roman Catholic theology maintains the nature-grace distinction with a robust account of **merit by grace**. **Thomists** typically hold that the **Incarnation** is ordered to redemption, citing ST III q1 a3; **Scotists** prioritize the **primacy of Christ** and posit the Incarnation without sin. Both accept that unfallen Adam needs supernatural elevation for the beatific end, but differ on whether the historical **Incarnation** is the normal means of that elevation in a sinless world.

Lutheran theology is wary of any talk of merit in Eden, stressing **law-gospel contrast** and the gratuity of life. The **Formula of Concord (1577)** avoids covenant-of-works constructions and rejects **condign merit**, though many Lutherans affirm that God could have confirmed Adam by promise apart from works. On the **Incarnation**, Lutheran orthodoxy tends toward a remedial focus, aligning more with the Thomist trajectory than with the **Scotist Christocentrism**.

Modern theology exhibits both retrieval and revision. **Edwards** in The End for Which God Created the World (1765) exalts **Gods glory** as ultimate, which some read as compatible with either remedial or supramundane **Incarnation**. Twentieth-century Christocentric proposals, from **Barth** to **de Lubac**, re-situate nature and grace: Barthian **election in Christ** could suggest a primordial Incarnation, while de Lubac's critique of a pure nature presses toward a more intrinsic ordination to **deification**. Analytic philosophy of religion introduces **Molinist counterfactuals** and **Plantinga's transworld depravity** (1974): perhaps in all feasible worlds with significantly free creatures, some fall occurs, rendering the sinless Adam counterfactual unachievable for God without overriding freedom, which raises questions for **compatibilist providence** and the modal space of redemption.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
A first debate concerns the coherence of Adamic merit. Reformed theology insists that any promise of life is by **voluntary condescension**, not proportioned desert, thereby avoiding the specter of **Pelagian self-advancement**. Critics argue that if God grants life only upon obedience, gratuity erodes; defenders counter that pactal ordination preserves gratuity while honoring **creaturely vocation** under law. A second debate concerns whether the world without the fall would lack the supreme manifestation of **divine mercy**, fueling the liturgical **felix culpa**: O happy fault that merited so great a Redeemer. Some demur that this risks instrumentalizing sin; others reply that **divine providence** can will to permit evil for greater goods without making evil necessary.

A third debate targets the **Incarnation**: Is a non-remedial Incarnation fitting? Thomists reply that Scripture narrates the mission as redemptive, while Scotists cite the **primacy of Christ** texts and the independent fittingness of union of Creator and creature. Analytic challenges ask whether a non-fallen humanity would need a mediator; proponents of an **incarnation in gloria** envision the Son as royal head who elevates the race apart from atonement, maintaining **opera Trinitatis ad extra** as undivided yet diversified by the economy.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
Within **Theology Proper**, the counterfactual tests the manner of the **divine decree**. Classical theism affirms **divine simplicity** and a single will *ad intra* with manifold effects *ad extra*. Whether Adam stands or falls, God does not change; rather, the eternal purpose includes either a covenantal confirmation or a redemptive economy. **Providence** encompasses genuine secondary causes, so the counterfactual sharpens accounts of concurrence and permission.

In **Christology**, the Adamic question evaluates second-Adam typology. If Adam stands, Christ may still be head by **anakephalaiosis** rather than by expiation; if Adam falls, Christ's headship is cruciform. **Anthropology** frames created nature with an end that exceeds nature, so that even innocence requires **grace for glory**. **Soteriology** clarifies the difference between prelapsarian obedience and postlapsarian faith in the Mediator, reinforcing **federal headship** and vicarious obedience in the actual economy. **Eschatology** is decisive: Eden was not the terminus but the vestibule to **Sabbath consummation**, signified by the **tree of life** and later realized in Revelation 22. **Ecclesiology** follows: without the fall, the human race would have been a holy society under Adamic headship; with the fall, the **church** is the gathered people under the second Adam by **new covenant**.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastorally, the question deploys **divine generosity** and resets our instinct about grace: even in Eden, life beyond nature was a gift of **voluntary condescension**. Liturgically, the **felix culpa** reminds us that God is not defeated by evil; yet catechesis must avoid romanticizing sin by teaching the surpassing goodness of a world where Adam stood and the even greater **mercy** by which Christ raises the fallen. The counterfactual disciplines hope toward **Sabbath eschatology** and trains worship to see in Christs obedience the restoration and surplus of what Adam could have had.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
To ask what if Adam had not sinned is finally to contemplate how the one, simple will of the triune God orders creation to **Sabbath glory** either by covenantal confirmation or, as in fact, by the **Incarnation and redemption** of the second Adam.
