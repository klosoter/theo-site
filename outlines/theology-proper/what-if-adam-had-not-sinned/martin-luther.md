# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther addressed the question of Adam's hypothetical obedience within the framework of **original righteousness**, the **covenant of works**, and the **nature of human will**. For Luther, Adam's state before the Fall was characterized by a genuine freedom and harmony with God's law, but he maintained that even in this state, Adam's righteousness was a gift, not an autonomous possession. Luther speculated that had Adam not sinned, humanity would have continued in **innocence**, enjoying unbroken **communion with God** and the blessings of **eternal life**.

- "If Adam had remained steadfast, he would have passed over to the spiritual life, in which he would neither have eaten nor drunk nor been concerned with procreation." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Righteousness as Gift**
    - Adam was created in a state of **original righteousness**, not by merit but by divine grace.
    - This righteousness entailed a perfect relationship with God and harmony within creation.
    - Adam’s obedience was to be maintained by continual dependence on God’s sustaining grace.
    - The state of innocence was not immutable; it required ongoing trust in God.
    - "Adam was created righteous and upright, but not immutable in that righteousness." (Lectures on Genesis)

2. **Conditional Promise of Eternal Life**
    - Luther affirmed a **covenant of works**: Adam was promised eternal life upon obedience.
    - The prohibition regarding the tree of knowledge was a test of faith and obedience.
    - Had Adam obeyed, he would have been confirmed in righteousness and immortality.
    - The transition to a higher, spiritual life was contingent on Adam’s perseverance.
    - "If Adam had remained obedient, he would have been translated from physical to spiritual life without death." (Lectures on Genesis)

3. **Human Will and Freedom Before the Fall**
    - Adam possessed true **free will** in the state of innocence.
    - This freedom was oriented toward God and the good, not yet enslaved by sin.
    - The will was capable of obedience but not independent of God’s grace.
    - The Fall resulted in the loss of this original freedom and the bondage of the will.
    - "Before the Fall, the will was free and able to choose the good, but only by God’s grace." (The Bondage of the Will)

4. **No Merit Apart from Grace**
    - Even in innocence, Adam’s obedience would not have merited reward apart from God’s gracious promise.
    - Luther rejected any notion of **human merit** as the basis for eternal life.
    - The relationship between God and Adam was always one of grace, not strict justice.
    - The reward of life was a gift, not a wage earned by works.
    - "God’s promise, not Adam’s merit, would have secured eternal life." (Lectures on Genesis)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment Without Sin**
    - Had Adam not sinned, humanity would have entered into a glorified, spiritual existence.
    - There would have been no death, suffering, or alienation from God.
    - The earth would have been filled with righteous descendants, living in perfect fellowship.
    - The ultimate goal was unbroken **communion with God** and participation in divine life.
    - "The translation to spiritual life would have been the consummation of Adam’s obedience." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s reflections on Adam’s hypothetical obedience shaped later Protestant discussions of the **covenant of works** and the nature of **original righteousness**. His insistence on the primacy of grace, even before the Fall, influenced Reformed and Lutheran anthropology. While Luther did not systematize this topic as later scholastics did, his insights remain foundational for understanding the relationship between creation, grace, and eschatology in Protestant theology.
