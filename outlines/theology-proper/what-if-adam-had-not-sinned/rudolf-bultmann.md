# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the question of Adam’s sin through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He rejected a literal-historical reading of the **Fall**, viewing the Genesis narrative as a myth expressing the universal human condition of **sinfulness** rather than a factual account of a historical Adam. For Bultmann, the question "What if Adam had not sinned?" is not meaningful within his framework, as **original sin** is not a transmitted event but an existential reality for every person.

- "The Adam story is not a report of an event in primeval history; it is a mythical expression of the human situation." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann (1960)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of the Fall**
    - The Genesis account is a myth, not a literal historical event.
    - The story expresses the existential reality of human alienation from God.
    - The question of Adam’s hypothetical obedience is irrelevant to the existential message.
    - The narrative’s value lies in its symbolic depiction of the human condition.
    - "Mythology expresses a certain understanding of human existence in the world." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Sin**
    - Sin is not inherited from a first ancestor but is the universal existential state of humanity.
    - Each person reenacts the Fall in their own existence.
    - The focus is on **authentic existence** versus **inauthentic existence** before God.
    - The Adam narrative illustrates the ever-present possibility of human estrangement.
    - "Every man is Adam." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Speculative Counterfactuals**
    - Bultmann dismisses questions about what might have happened if Adam had not sinned.
    - Such speculation is rooted in a mythological worldview he seeks to overcome.
    - Theological focus should be on present human existence, not hypothetical histories.
    - Salvation is not about reversing a historical Fall but about existential transformation.
    - "The question of what might have happened is meaningless for faith." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Christ as the New Adam in Existential Terms**
    - Christ is not a second literal Adam but the revelation of authentic existence.
    - Redemption is not a historical undoing of Adam’s act but a call to new being in Christ.
    - The contrast between Adam and Christ is existential, not genealogical.
    - Faith in Christ overcomes the existential condition symbolized by Adam.
    - "In Christ, a new possibility of existence is disclosed." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Scripture as Kerygma, Not History**
    - The value of biblical narratives lies in their proclamation (**kerygma**), not historical reportage.
    - The Adam story functions as a call to self-understanding before God.
    - Theological meaning is found in existential encounter, not in factual origins.
    - The myth of Adam serves to illuminate the reality of human sinfulness and need for grace.
    - "Scripture is not a source of information about the past, but a call to decision." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **original sin** and the Adam narrative profoundly shaped modern theology’s engagement with myth and existentialism. His insistence on **demythologization** redirected theological inquiry from speculative questions about Adam’s potential obedience to the existential realities of faith and human existence. While controversial among traditionalists, his work remains foundational for existential and neo-orthodox readings of Scripture, challenging theologians to reconsider the meaning and function of biblical narratives in contemporary faith.
