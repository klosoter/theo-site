# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the question of Adam's hypothetical non-sin from the perspective of **existential estrangement** and **symbolic interpretation** of the Fall. For Tillich, the story of Adam is not a literal historical account but a **mythological expression** of the **universal human condition** of **estrangement from God**. Thus, the question "What if Adam had not sinned?" is reframed: the Fall is an existential reality, not a contingent historical event.

- "The story of the Fall is not a story of an event which happened 'once upon a time,' but the description of a universal and necessary structure of human existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Fall as Existential, Not Historical**
   - The Fall represents the **universal estrangement** of humanity from God.
   - Adam is a **symbol** of every person, not a unique historical individual.
   - The question of Adam not sinning is rendered moot; estrangement is part of the human condition.
   - The myth expresses the **ontological structure** of existence, not a historical contingency.
   - "Adam is not a historical figure, but a symbol for the structure of existence in which every man participates." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Sin as Unavoidable Estrangement**
   - Sin is the **universal condition** of separation from the Ground of Being.
   - There is no state of "innocence" that could have persisted indefinitely.
   - Human existence is always already marked by **estrangement** and **anxiety**.
   - The possibility of not sinning is not a real existential option.
   - "Estrangement belongs to existence as such, not to an accidental event in the past." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Myth and Symbol in Theological Anthropology**
   - The Genesis narrative is **myth**, conveying existential truth.
   - The story of Adam and Eve is a **symbolic expression** of the human predicament.
   - Literal speculation about Adam's choices misunderstands the nature of the text.
   - The myth points to the **depth dimension** of human existence.
   - "The myth of the Fall expresses the paradox of man's created goodness and his actual estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Freedom and Finitude**
   - Human freedom is always exercised within the limits of **finitude**.
   - The possibility of sin is inherent in the structure of finite freedom.
   - There is no conceivable human existence without the risk—and actuality—of estrangement.
   - The "what if" question is a misunderstanding of the existential situation.
   - "Finitude and freedom together make estrangement inevitable." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Redemption as Overcoming Estrangement**
   - The focus is not on a hypothetical innocence, but on **reconciliation**.
   - **Salvation** is the healing of the universal estrangement, not a return to a lost state.
   - Christ is the **New Being** who overcomes the existential condition symbolized by Adam.
   - The question points us to the need for **grace**, not speculation about innocence.
   - "The New Being in Christ is the answer to the estrangement symbolized by Adam." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential and symbolic reading of the Fall profoundly shaped **modern theological anthropology**, shifting the focus from historical speculation to the **universal condition of estrangement**. His approach influenced later existential and liberal theologians, encouraging a move away from literalist readings of Genesis. Tillich’s reframing of the Adamic narrative continues to challenge traditional doctrines of original sin and the **nature of redemption** in contemporary theology.
