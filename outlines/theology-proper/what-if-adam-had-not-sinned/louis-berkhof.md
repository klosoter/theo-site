# Louis Berkhof (1873–1957)

Louis Berkhof, in line with classic **Reformed theology**, taught that if Adam had not sinned, he would have passed from his original state of **probation** to a state of **confirmed righteousness and eternal life**. This transition would have been the result of Adam fulfilling the **Covenant of Works**, thereby securing **eschatological blessing** for himself and his posterity without the need for **redemption**.

- "If Adam had obeyed the law of God, he would have passed from the possibility of sinning to the state of confirmed holiness and blessedness." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Reality of the Covenant of Works**
    - Adam was placed under a real, historical **Covenant of Works** with God.
    - The covenant included a clear **probationary command** and a promise of life.
    - The threat of death and the promise of life were both real and binding.
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** for all humanity.
    - "The promise of the covenant was the promise of eternal life in the highest sense." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Probation and Eschatological Advancement**
    - Adam’s obedience would have led to a higher, immutable state.
    - The original state was not the final goal; **eschatological advancement** was possible.
    - The tree of life symbolized the reward for obedience.
    - Adam’s probation was temporary, designed to be completed.
    - "Adam was destined to pass from the state of posse peccare to that of non posse peccare." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Absence of Redemption in a Sinless World**
    - No need for **atonement** or **redemption** if Adam had not sinned.
    - The work of Christ as **mediator** would not have been necessary.
    - Human history would have unfolded without the drama of sin and salvation.
    - The **grace of redemption** would not have entered human experience.
    - "There would have been no occasion for the work of Christ as Redeemer." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Transmission of Blessing to Posterity**
    - Adam’s obedience would have secured **eternal life** for all his descendants.
    - The principle of **federal headship** means his reward would be imputed to humanity.
    - The whole human race would have shared in Adam’s confirmed righteousness.
    - The curse and corruption of sin would never have entered the world.
    - "The blessings of the covenant would have been transmitted to all his descendants." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Nature of Original Righteousness**
    - Adam’s original righteousness was mutable, not yet confirmed.
    - Obedience would have led to **confirmed righteousness** and inability to sin.
    - The state of innocence was preparatory, not ultimate.
    - The **image of God** in man would have been perfected, not lost or marred.
    - "Adam was created in a state of positive holiness, but not in a state of confirmed perfection." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkhof’s articulation of the **Covenant of Works** and its implications for Adam’s obedience has shaped much of twentieth-century **Reformed systematic theology**. His clear, concise synthesis of the tradition has made his work a standard reference for understanding the hypothetical state of humanity had Adam not sinned. Berkhof’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of federal headship, original righteousness, and the structure of redemptive history.
