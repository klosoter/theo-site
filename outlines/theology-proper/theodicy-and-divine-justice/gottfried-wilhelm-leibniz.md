# Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716)

Leibniz’s approach to **theodicy** centers on reconciling the existence of **evil** with the **goodness** and **justice of God**. He famously argued that God, being **omniscient** and **benevolent**, created "the best of all possible worlds," where evil is permitted for the sake of greater goods and the harmony of the whole. Leibniz’s theodicy remains a foundational attempt to defend **divine justice** in the face of suffering and moral evil.

- "This is the best of all possible worlds." (Theodicy)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Best Possible World Thesis**
   - God, being **perfectly wise and good**, chooses to create the world that achieves the greatest possible balance of good over evil.
   - The existence of evil is permitted only insofar as it contributes to the greater harmony and perfection of the universe.
   - Every event, including evil, fits into a pre-established order that ultimately manifests divine wisdom.
   - The world’s apparent imperfections are necessary for the realization of higher goods not otherwise attainable.
   - "God, being infinitely wise, has chosen the best out of all possible plans." (Theodicy)

2. **Evil as Privation**
   - Evil is not a substance but a **privation** or lack of good, echoing Augustinian tradition.
   - Moral and physical evils are deficiencies in created beings, not positive creations of God.
   - God permits evil but does not directly will it; his will remains oriented toward the good.
   - The metaphysical structure of reality allows for imperfection in finite beings.
   - "Evil is only the privation of good, and not a positive thing." (Theodicy)

3. **Divine Justice and Wisdom**
   - God’s **justice** is inseparable from his wisdom and goodness; he acts according to the highest reason.
   - Divine justice ensures that all suffering and evil are integrated into a just and purposeful order.
   - God’s justice is not arbitrary but grounded in the rational structure of the universe.
   - Human perceptions of injustice stem from limited understanding of God’s comprehensive plan.
   - "God’s justice is always in accord with his wisdom." (Theodicy)

4. **Pre-established Harmony**
   - The universe operates according to a **pre-established harmony** ordained by God.
   - All substances act in accordance with their own natures, coordinated by divine decree.
   - Apparent disorder or injustice is harmonized at the level of the whole, not always visible to finite minds.
   - This harmony ensures that the moral and physical realms are ultimately reconciled.
   - "There is a perfect harmony between the kingdom of nature and the kingdom of grace." (Monadology)

5. **Human Freedom and Responsibility**
   - Human beings possess genuine **freedom** within the bounds of God’s foreknowledge and providence.
   - Moral evil arises from the misuse of creaturely freedom, not from divine causation.
   - God’s foreordination does not negate human responsibility for sin and moral choices.
   - The compatibility of divine sovereignty and human liberty is central to Leibniz’s theodicy.
   - "Our liberty does not exclude necessity, but implies it." (Theodicy)

## Legacy and Impact

Leibniz’s theodicy has profoundly shaped subsequent discussions of **divine justice** and the problem of evil, especially within the **Reformed** and philosophical traditions. His articulation of the **best possible world** and the notion of evil as privation remain central reference points in debates on the rationality of faith and the nature of God. While often critiqued, his synthesis of metaphysics and theology continues to influence both analytic philosophy and systematic theology.
