# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically reoriented the discussion of **theodicy** and **divine justice** by insisting that God’s righteousness is revealed supremely in **Jesus Christ** rather than in abstract rational systems. He rejected traditional attempts to justify God in the face of evil, emphasizing the **sovereignty of God**, the **revelation of God’s justice in the cross**, and the inscrutability of divine purposes. For Barth, human efforts to explain or defend God’s justice apart from revelation are fundamentally misguided.

- "God’s righteousness is revealed in the event of Jesus Christ, not in the solution of the world’s riddles." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics II/1: The Doctrine of God
- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics I/2: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- "The Humanity of God"
- Karl Barth: Theologian of Freedom (Eberhard Busch)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation-centered theodicy**
    - God’s justice is known only through **revelation** in Jesus Christ.
    - Human reason cannot independently justify God’s ways.
    - The cross is the definitive disclosure of divine righteousness.
    - Theodicy is not a philosophical problem but a matter of faith in God’s self-disclosure.
    - "We do not justify God; God justifies Himself in His revelation." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

2. **Rejection of speculative theodicy**
    - Barth opposes rational or metaphysical attempts to explain evil.
    - He views such efforts as presumptuous and anthropocentric.
    - The mystery of evil remains unresolved apart from Christ.
    - Human suffering cannot be justified by appealing to abstract principles.
    - "The question of theodicy is answered only in the event of God’s self-revelation." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

3. **Christocentric understanding of justice**
    - Divine justice is revealed in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
    - The cross is the locus where God’s justice and mercy meet.
    - God’s judgment is inseparable from His grace in Christ.
    - All human notions of justice are relativized by the revelation in Christ.
    - "The righteousness of God is His mercy in judgment, revealed in Christ crucified." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **God’s sovereignty and freedom**
    - God is absolutely free in His dealings with creation.
    - Divine justice is not subject to human standards or expectations.
    - God’s purposes transcend human comprehension.
    - Theodicy must respect the Creator-creature distinction.
    - "God is righteous in His freedom, not according to our measure." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

5. **Evil as the ‘impossible possibility’**
    - Barth describes evil as real but ultimately without ontological grounding.
    - Evil is a contradiction, a ‘nothingness’ opposed to God’s will.
    - God permits evil but does not will it positively.
    - The victory over evil is accomplished in Christ’s resurrection.
    - "Evil is that which God has conquered and will finally banish." (Church Dogmatics III/3)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s approach to **theodicy** has profoundly shaped modern theology by shifting the focus from rational justification of God to the revelation of divine justice in Christ. His insistence on the **sovereignty of God** and the centrality of the cross challenged both classical apologetics and liberal optimism. Barth’s legacy endures in contemporary discussions that prioritize **Christocentric revelation** over speculative answers to the problem of evil, influencing both Reformed and broader Christian thought.
