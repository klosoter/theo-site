# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck approached **theodicy** and **divine justice** from within the framework of **Reformed orthodoxy**, emphasizing the harmony of God's **sovereignty**, **goodness**, and **wisdom** in the face of evil and suffering. He maintained that God's justice is inseparable from His other attributes, and that the ultimate resolution of the problem of evil is found in the **redemptive work of Christ** and the consummation of all things.

- "The world with all its evil is not an end in itself but exists for the sake of the revelation of the glory of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty and Providence**
    - God ordains all that comes to pass, including evil, yet is not the author of sin.
    - Divine providence encompasses both the preservation and governance of creation.
    - Evil is permitted for the greater manifestation of God's glory and justice.
    - Human responsibility is upheld within God’s sovereign decree.
    - "God is not the cause of sin, but nothing happens without His will." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Justice as an Attribute of God**
    - Divine justice is intrinsic to God's being and inseparable from His holiness.
    - God’s justice is both retributive and restorative, ensuring moral order.
    - The justice of God is ultimately revealed in the cross of Christ.
    - Human perceptions of justice are subordinate to God’s perfect standard.
    - "God’s justice is not an abstract principle but the living will of God Himself." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Theodicy Rooted in Christology**
    - The problem of evil finds its answer in the person and work of Christ.
    - Christ’s atonement demonstrates both God’s justice and mercy.
    - The suffering of Christ is the ultimate theodicy, revealing God’s solidarity with humanity.
    - Redemption is the means by which God overcomes evil and vindicates His justice.
    - "In Christ, God Himself enters into the suffering of the world." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Eschatological Resolution**
    - The full vindication of divine justice awaits the final judgment.
    - Evil and suffering are temporary and will be abolished in the new creation.
    - The eschaton brings the complete revelation of God’s justice and goodness.
    - Hope in the consummation sustains faith amid present suffering.
    - "The end of all things will reveal the justice and wisdom of God to all creatures." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

5. **Human Limitation and Mystery**
    - Human understanding of God’s ways is finite and often incomplete.
    - Mystery is inherent in the coexistence of divine sovereignty and evil.
    - Faith seeks understanding but ultimately rests in God’s self-revelation.
    - The limits of reason call for humility before the mystery of providence.
    - "We do not solve the problem of evil; we confess it and await God’s answer." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced approach to **theodicy** has shaped modern Reformed theology, offering a robust account of **divine justice** that integrates biblical revelation, systematic coherence, and pastoral sensitivity. His emphasis on the centrality of Christ and the eschatological hope provides a framework for addressing the problem of evil without diminishing God’s sovereignty or goodness. Bavinck’s work continues to influence theologians grappling with the complexities of suffering and the justice of God.
