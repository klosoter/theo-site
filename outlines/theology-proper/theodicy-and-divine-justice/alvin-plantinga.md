# Alvin Plantinga (1932–)

Alvin Plantinga is a leading analytic philosopher whose work on **theodicy** and **divine justice** has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of the **problem of evil**. He is best known for articulating the **Free Will Defense**, arguing that the existence of evil is logically compatible with the existence of an **omnipotent**, **omniscient**, and **morally perfect God**.

- "A world containing creatures who are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all." ("God, Freedom, and Evil")

## Key Works

- God, Freedom, and Evil (1974)
- The Nature of Necessity (1974)
- "The Free Will Defense" (in various essays and lectures)
- "Self-Profile" in Alvin Plantinga, ed. by James E. Tomberlin (1985)
- The Problem of Evil, ed. by Marilyn McCord Adams and Robert Merrihew Adams (Plantinga’s contributions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Free Will Defense as a Theodicy**
    - Argues that **moral evil** results from the misuse of **creaturely freedom**.
    - Maintains that genuine **libertarian freedom** is necessary for meaningful moral action.
    - Claims that even an **omnipotent God** cannot create free creatures who always choose good.
    - Asserts that the existence of evil is logically compatible with God's attributes.
    - "It was not within God's power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil." (God, Freedom, and Evil)

2. **Logical Problem of Evil is Defeated**
    - Distinguishes between the **logical** and **evidential** problems of evil.
    - Argues that no contradiction exists between God and the existence of evil.
    - Provides a possible scenario in which God and evil coexist.
    - Shifts the burden of proof to critics to show an explicit contradiction.
    - "The existence of evil is not inconsistent with the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, wholly good God." (God, Freedom, and Evil)

3. **Transworld Depravity**
    - Introduces the concept that every possible world with free creatures contains some evil.
    - Suggests that it is possible all free creatures would go wrong in any feasible world.
    - Uses this to explain why God might permit evil even if He is omnipotent.
    - Supports the coherence of divine justice in a world with evil.
    - "It is possible that every essence suffers from transworld depravity." (The Nature of Necessity)

4. **Divine Omnipotence and Moral Responsibility**
    - Emphasizes that **omnipotence** does not entail the ability to do the logically impossible.
    - Argues that creating free creatures who never sin is logically incoherent.
    - Maintains that moral responsibility requires the real possibility of wrongdoing.
    - Defends God's justice in permitting evil for the sake of greater goods.
    - "A world containing free creatures is more valuable than one containing none." (God, Freedom, and Evil)

5. **Skeptical Theism and Epistemic Limits**
    - Suggests humans are limited in their ability to discern God's reasons for permitting evil.
    - Warns against assuming we would know God's justifying reasons if they existed.
    - Argues that apparent gratuitous evil does not undermine rational belief in God.
    - Supports a posture of humility before divine providence and justice.
    - "Our cognitive limitations make it unsurprising that we cannot see the point of many evils." (various essays)

## Legacy and Impact

Plantinga’s work on the **problem of evil** has been pivotal in shifting philosophical consensus, with many now agreeing that the logical problem of evil is not a decisive objection to theism. His **Free Will Defense** is widely regarded as a major contribution to both analytic philosophy and Christian apologetics. Plantinga’s arguments have influenced not only philosophical theology but also discussions of **divine justice** and the rationality of faith in the face of suffering. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the coherence of theism and the nature of **human freedom**.
