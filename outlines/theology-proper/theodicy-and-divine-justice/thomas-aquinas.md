# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached **theodicy** and **divine justice** through the lens of **classical theism**, emphasizing the compatibility of God's **goodness**, **omnipotence**, and **omniscience** with the existence of evil. He argued that **evil** is a privation of good and that God's **justice** is perfectly expressed in both the order of creation and the administration of **divine providence**.

- "God is not the cause of evil, but only of good." (Summa Theologiae I, q.49, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I, q.21, q.49; I-II, q.87)
- Summa Contra Gentiles (Book III, chs. 66–71)
- De Malo
- Commentary on the Book of Job
- The Oxford Handbook of Aquinas (ed. Davies & Stump, for secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Evil as Privation of Good**
    - Evil does not have positive existence; it is the absence or lack of good.
    - God, as pure act and goodness itself, cannot be the direct cause of evil.
    - The existence of evil is permitted for the sake of greater goods.
    - Evil serves a role in the perfection and order of the universe.
    - "Evil is not an essence or a being, but the privation of good." (Summa Theologiae I, q.48, a.1)

2. **Divine Justice is Perfect and Immutable**
    - God's justice is identical with His essence and is unchanging.
    - Divine justice is not measured by human standards, but by God's own nature.
    - God rewards and punishes according to perfect wisdom and order.
    - Justice is expressed in the fittingness of God's providential acts.
    - "Justice is in God as in its most perfect subject." (Summa Theologiae I, q.21, a.1)

3. **Providence and Secondary Causes**
    - God governs all things through **divine providence**.
    - Secondary causes are real and operate within God's providential order.
    - God permits evil through secondary causes to bring about greater goods.
    - Human free will operates under, but not apart from, divine providence.
    - "God is the universal cause of all things, but He causes some things by means of others." (Summa Contra Gentiles III, ch.70)

4. **The Goodness of God and the Existence of Evil**
    - God's goodness is not compromised by the existence of evil.
    - The presence of evil allows for the manifestation of greater goods, such as justice and mercy.
    - The order and harmony of the universe require the existence of both higher and lower goods.
    - God's permission of evil is always oriented toward the ultimate good.
    - "God allows evils to happen in order to bring a greater good therefrom." (Summa Theologiae III, q.1, a.3)

5. **Human Responsibility and Divine Justice**
    - Humans are morally responsible for evil acts due to free will.
    - Divine justice ensures that all evil is either punished or turned to good.
    - Temporal suffering and evil are occasions for the exercise of virtue and growth.
    - Final justice is realized in the eschatological judgment.
    - "God does not will moral evil, but permits it for the sake of free will." (De Malo, q.3, a.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas's synthesis of **theodicy** and **divine justice** has profoundly shaped both Catholic and broader Christian thought, providing a framework for reconciling the existence of evil with the **goodness and sovereignty of God**. His distinction between evil as privation and the positive order of creation remains foundational in classical theism. Later theologians, both Roman Catholic and Reformed, have engaged deeply with his arguments, making Aquinas a central figure in ongoing discussions of **providence**, **justice**, and the problem of evil.
