# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **theodicy** and **divine justice** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He rejected traditional metaphysical explanations for evil and suffering, instead emphasizing the individual's encounter with God in **faith** and the existential meaning of **justification**. For Bultmann, questions of **divine justice** are reframed within the existential situation of the human before God, rather than as speculative solutions to the problem of evil.

- "It is not the task of faith to solve the problem of theodicy, but to trust in God in spite of it." (Faith and Understanding)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Existence and Faith (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Theodicy**
    - The biblical language of **evil** and **divine justice** must be interpreted existentially, not as literal metaphysical claims.
    - Traditional theodicies are seen as mythological attempts to rationalize suffering.
    - The focus shifts from explaining evil to confronting it in personal existence.
    - The meaning of suffering is found in authentic response, not in speculative answers.
    - "Mythological thinking tries to make sense of suffering, but faith accepts the mystery." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter with Divine Justice**
    - **Divine justice** is not a cosmic principle but an existential reality encountered in faith.
    - The individual's relationship to God is defined by decision and response, not by rational theodicy.
    - **Justification** is experienced as a present reality, not a future vindication.
    - The question is not why evil exists, but how one stands before God amid evil.
    - "God’s righteousness is not a doctrine but an event in which man is addressed." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Objective Theodicy**
    - Bultmann denies the possibility of an objective, rational explanation for evil.
    - Attempts to justify God’s ways are seen as incompatible with authentic faith.
    - Theodicy is replaced by the call to decision in the face of suffering.
    - The cross is the paradigm of God’s action, not a solution to the problem of evil.
    - "The cross does not explain suffering; it calls us to faith in the midst of it." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Faith as Trust Amid Suffering**
    - Faith is fundamentally trust in God, not intellectual assent to explanations.
    - The believer is called to live authentically in the face of unresolved evil.
    - Assurance of **divine justice** comes through existential encounter, not logical proof.
    - The ambiguity of history and suffering is embraced as the context for faith.
    - "Faith does not remove the scandal of evil; it lives with it." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Redefinition of Eschatological Justice**
    - **Eschatology** is interpreted existentially, not as a future cosmic event.
    - **Divine justice** is realized in the present encounter with Christ, not postponed to the end of history.
    - The hope of vindication is transformed into the call to authentic existence now.
    - The final judgment is a metaphor for the existential crisis of decision before God.
    - "Eschatological hope is the hope of authentic existence, not of cosmic compensation." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **theodicy** and **divine justice** profoundly influenced modern theology by shifting the focus from metaphysical speculation to existential interpretation. His method of **demythologization** challenged traditional apologetic responses to evil and suffering, emphasizing the primacy of faith and personal encounter with God. While controversial, his work remains foundational for existential and post-liberal approaches to the problem of evil, and continues to provoke debate on the meaning of **justification** and the nature of **divine justice** in contemporary theology.
