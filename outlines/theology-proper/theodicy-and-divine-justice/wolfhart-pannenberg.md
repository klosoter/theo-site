# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **theodicy** and **divine justice** through the lens of **eschatology** and the **self-revelation of God in history**. He argued that the resolution of evil and suffering is inseparable from the ultimate fulfillment of **God’s kingdom**, where **divine justice** is fully manifested. For Pannenberg, the justification of God’s ways is only intelligible in light of the **resurrection** and the final consummation of history.

- "Only in the eschatological consummation of history will the justification of God be manifest to all." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially sections on providence, evil, and eschatology)
- Theology and the Kingdom of God
- Jesus—God and Man
- Revelation as History
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Resolution of Theodicy**
    - The problem of evil cannot be resolved within the limits of present history.
    - **Divine justice** will be fully revealed only at the end of history.
    - The **resurrection of Christ** is the pledge and anticipation of this final resolution.
    - Human suffering and injustice are provisional, awaiting eschatological vindication.
    - "The justification of God is bound up with the eschatological completion of his rule." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **God’s Self-Revelation in History**
    - God reveals himself progressively through historical events, culminating in Christ.
    - The meaning of suffering and evil is clarified through God’s acts in history.
    - **Revelation** is not static but unfolds toward its fulfillment.
    - Theodicy is inseparable from the historical self-disclosure of God.
    - "God’s deity is revealed in his rule over history, not apart from it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Universal Scope of Divine Justice**
    - **Divine justice** is not limited to individuals but encompasses all creation.
    - The final judgment will address both personal and systemic evil.
    - God’s justice is restorative, aiming at the reconciliation of all things.
    - Theodicy must account for the cosmic dimensions of redemption.
    - "The justice of God is universal, embracing the whole of creation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **The Centrality of the Resurrection**
    - The resurrection is the decisive event for understanding God’s justice.
    - It demonstrates God’s power to overcome evil and death.
    - The resurrection is the guarantee of future vindication for all suffering.
    - Theodicy is grounded in the reality of Christ’s victory over evil.
    - "The resurrection of Jesus is the foundation of Christian hope in the final triumph of God’s justice." (Jesus—God and Man)

5. **Provisional Nature of Present Suffering**
    - Present suffering is real but not ultimate in God’s plan.
    - The meaning of suffering is only fully disclosed in the eschaton.
    - Faith involves trust in God’s future justification of his ways.
    - Theodicy requires patience and hope oriented toward the future.
    - "The suffering of the present time is not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to **theodicy** has significantly shaped contemporary discussions by insisting on the **eschatological** horizon of divine justice. His integration of **history**, **revelation**, and **resurrection** as keys to understanding suffering has influenced both systematic theology and philosophical theology. By rooting the justification of God in the future consummation of all things, Pannenberg provided a robust alternative to more speculative or abstract theodicies. His work continues to challenge theologians to consider the cosmic and historical dimensions of **divine justice**.
