# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the problem of **theodicy** and **divine justice** from a robustly Reformed perspective, emphasizing the absolute sovereignty, holiness, and righteousness of God. He maintained that God's justice is perfectly expressed in both **redemptive history** and the **atonement**, and that human inability to fully comprehend God's ways does not undermine the reality of His justice.

- "The ultimate solution to the problem of evil is found only in the sovereign wisdom and righteousness of God." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied
- Principles of Conduct
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- Calvin on Scripture and Divine Sovereignty

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Justice Is Intrinsic to His Nature**
    - God’s justice is not an abstract standard but is identical with His own holy character.
    - Divine justice is always consistent with God’s other attributes, especially **sovereignty** and **holiness**.
    - God’s justice is the foundation for His actions in both judgment and salvation.
    - Human perceptions of injustice arise from limited understanding, not from any defect in God.
    - "Justice is not something outside of God to which He must conform; it is that which God is." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Theodicy Rooted in Divine Sovereignty**
    - God ordains all that comes to pass, including the existence of evil, yet is not the author of sin.
    - The mystery of evil’s origin is ultimately inscrutable but does not impugn God’s righteousness.
    - God’s sovereignty ensures that all evil is overruled for His glory and the good of the elect.
    - Theodicy must begin with the Creator-creature distinction and the limits of human reason.
    - "We must recognize the mystery of God’s providence and bow in humble submission." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Justice Manifested in the Atonement**
    - The cross is the supreme demonstration of both God’s justice and mercy.
    - **Penal substitution** satisfies the demands of divine justice against sin.
    - The atonement is necessary because God cannot simply overlook sin without violating His justice.
    - Christ’s work upholds the moral order of the universe established by God’s law.
    - "The atonement is the provision God has made to maintain His justice in the justification of sinners." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Human Responsibility and Original Sin**
    - All humanity is justly condemned in Adam due to **original sin**.
    - God’s justice is not compromised by the imputation of Adam’s guilt to his posterity.
    - Human inability does not negate responsibility; moral accountability is preserved.
    - The justice of God is displayed in both the condemnation of the wicked and the salvation of the elect.
    - "The doctrine of original sin is not inconsistent with the justice of God." (The Epistle to the Romans)

5. **Eschatological Vindication of Divine Justice**
    - Final judgment will publicly manifest the righteousness of God’s ways.
    - The full answer to the problem of evil awaits the consummation of all things.
    - God’s justice will be vindicated in the ultimate separation of the righteous and the wicked.
    - The hope of believers rests in the future revelation of God’s perfect justice.
    - "The day of judgment will be the disclosure of the justice of God in all His dealings." (Principles of Conduct)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s defense of **divine justice** and his careful articulation of the **Reformed doctrine of theodicy** have shaped generations of theologians and pastors, especially within confessional Presbyterian and Reformed circles. His insistence on the harmony of God’s attributes and the centrality of the atonement in addressing the problem of evil remains influential. Murray’s work continues to be a touchstone for those seeking a biblically grounded, theologically rigorous approach to the mysteries of God’s justice and providence.
