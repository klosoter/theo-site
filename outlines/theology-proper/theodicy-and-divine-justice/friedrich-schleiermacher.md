# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached **theodicy** and **divine justice** through the lens of **God-consciousness** and the absolute dependence of humanity on God. He reframed traditional doctrines of **sin**, **providence**, and **evil**, emphasizing the harmonious unity of the divine will and the world order, and downplaying retributive justice in favor of a relational, holistic understanding of **divine righteousness**.

- "Evil is only the limitation of the creature, and not a positive existence opposed to God." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God-Consciousness as the Basis for Theodicy**
    - Human awareness of absolute dependence is the foundation for understanding evil and justice.
    - Theodicy is not a rational defense but a function of religious self-consciousness.
    - Sin and evil are interpreted through the disruption of God-consciousness.
    - Divine justice is relational, not forensic.
    - "The feeling of absolute dependence is itself the witness to the divine order." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Evil as Creaturely Limitation**
    - Evil is not a substance but the necessary limitation of finite existence.
    - There is no metaphysical dualism between good and evil.
    - Evil is permitted within the divine order for the sake of the whole.
    - The existence of evil does not contradict divine goodness.
    - "Evil is only the limitation of the creature, and not a positive existence opposed to God." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Divine Providence as Universal and Harmonious**
    - God’s providence encompasses all events in a unified world order.
    - Divine justice is seen in the harmonious interrelation of all things.
    - Particular evils are subsumed within the greater good of the whole.
    - Providence is not interventionist but immanent and sustaining.
    - "All that happens is included in the divine causality, which is the ground of the world’s unity." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Redefinition of Sin and Guilt**
    - Sin is the disturbance of the God-consciousness, not merely a legal transgression.
    - Guilt is relational, affecting the individual's participation in the divine life.
    - Theodicy is reframed as the restoration of harmony, not retribution.
    - Divine justice aims at reconciliation, not punishment.
    - "Sin is the disturbance of the harmony of the God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Divine Justice as Righteousness in Relationship**
    - Justice is God’s faithfulness to the order and purpose of creation.
    - Righteousness is realized in the restoration of the divine-human relationship.
    - Punishment is educative and restorative, not merely retributive.
    - Divine justice is inseparable from divine love.
    - "The righteousness of God is His faithfulness in maintaining the order of the world and restoring it when disturbed." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **theodicy** and **divine justice** marked a decisive shift from classical theism to a modern, relational paradigm. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** and the unity of divine providence influenced later liberal theology and set the stage for existential and process approaches to the problem of evil. While criticized for minimizing the seriousness of evil and sin, his thought remains foundational for discussions of **divine justice** in the context of modernity and religious experience.
