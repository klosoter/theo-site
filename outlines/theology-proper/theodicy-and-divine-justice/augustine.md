# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s approach to **theodicy** and **divine justice** centers on the affirmation of God’s absolute goodness and sovereignty, even in the presence of evil. He argues that **evil** is not a substance but a privation of good, and that **divine justice** is always upheld through God’s wise ordering of all things, including the use of evil for a greater good within the framework of **providence** and **original sin**.

- "For God judged it better to bring good out of evil than not to permit any evil to exist." (Enchiridion 11)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- On Free Choice of the Will (De Libero Arbitrio)
- On the Nature of Good (De Natura Boni)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Evil as Privation of Good**
   - Evil does not have independent existence; it is the absence or corruption of good.
   - God, as the creator of all things, is not the author of evil.
   - All created things are good in their nature, but can be corrupted.
   - The existence of evil highlights the greater beauty of the created order.
   - "For evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'" (City of God XI.9)

2. **Divine Justice is Perfect and Unquestionable**
   - God’s justice is not measured by human standards but by His own perfect nature.
   - Divine justice is always accomplished, even when hidden from human understanding.
   - Punishment and reward are distributed according to God’s inscrutable wisdom.
   - The apparent prosperity of the wicked and suffering of the righteous serve a greater divine purpose.
   - "God’s judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out." (City of God XXII.2)

3. **Providence Orders All Things**
   - God’s providence governs every event, including the existence of evil.
   - Nothing happens outside the scope of God’s sovereign will.
   - Even evil acts are used by God to fulfill His good purposes.
   - Human history is directed toward the ultimate triumph of the **City of God**.
   - "Nothing, therefore, happens unless the Omnipotent wills it to happen." (Enchiridion 100)

4. **Human Responsibility and Free Will**
   - Humans possess genuine free will, though it is weakened by **original sin**.
   - Moral evil arises from the misuse of free will, not from God’s creative act.
   - Divine foreknowledge does not negate human responsibility.
   - The will is free, but only truly free when oriented toward God.
   - "It is by our own will that we sin, and not by the compulsion of fate." (On Free Choice of the Will III.3)

5. **Redemptive Purpose in Suffering**
   - Suffering and evil serve as means for spiritual growth and discipline.
   - God permits evil to bring about a greater good, especially the manifestation of grace.
   - The suffering of the righteous is used to purify and prepare them for eternal life.
   - The ultimate resolution of evil is found in the eschatological fulfillment of **divine justice**.
   - "God judged it better to bring good out of evil than not to permit any evil to exist." (Enchiridion 11)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **theodicy** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, providing a framework for understanding the coexistence of evil and a just, omnipotent God. His concepts of **evil as privation** and the primacy of **divine providence** influenced both medieval and Reformation theology. Augustine’s insights continue to inform contemporary discussions on **divine justice**, human freedom, and the problem of evil, making his work foundational for systematic theology.
