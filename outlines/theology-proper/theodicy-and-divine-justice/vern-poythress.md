# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches **theodicy** and **divine justice** through a robustly **Trinitarian** and **multiperspectival** framework, emphasizing God's sovereign orchestration of all events for His glory. He affirms the compatibility of **God’s goodness** and **omnipotence** with the existence of evil, grounding his theodicy in **biblical revelation** and the **redemptive-historical** narrative centered on Christ.

- "God’s purposes in evil are always wise, just, and good, even when we do not fully understand them." (Redeeming Science)

## Key Works

- Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach to the Place of Science and Human Understanding
- The Lordship of Christ: Serving Our Savior All of the Time, in All of Life, with All of Our Heart
- Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology
- Logic: A God-Centered Approach to the Foundation of Western Thought
- Chance and the Sovereignty of God: A God-Centered Approach to Probability and Random Events

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty Over Evil**
   - God ordains all that comes to pass, including evil, without Himself being the author of sin.
   - Evil serves God’s ultimate purposes, displaying His justice, mercy, and wisdom.
   - Human responsibility is upheld within God’s sovereign plan.
   - The mystery of evil is acknowledged, but never undermines God’s lordship.
   - "God is sovereign over all events, including those we call evil, yet He remains perfectly holy." (Chance and the Sovereignty of God)

2. **Multiperspectival Approach to Theodicy**
   - The problem of evil must be addressed from normative (Scripture), situational (world), and existential (self) perspectives.
   - No single perspective exhausts the depth of the issue; all are necessary for a holistic response.
   - Multiperspectivalism guards against reductionism in theodicy.
   - This approach reflects the complexity and unity of God’s truth.
   - "We need to look at the problem of evil from multiple perspectives to appreciate the fullness of God’s answer." (Symphonic Theology)

3. **Christ-Centered Resolution**
   - The cross of Christ is the ultimate demonstration of God’s justice and mercy in the face of evil.
   - Redemption in Christ provides the key to understanding suffering and divine justice.
   - Theodicy is inseparable from the gospel and God’s redemptive plan.
   - Christ’s suffering reframes human experiences of evil and injustice.
   - "The suffering and resurrection of Christ is God’s answer to the deepest questions of evil and justice." (Redeeming Science)

4. **Biblical Revelation as Foundational**
   - Scripture is the ultimate authority for understanding God’s justice and the problem of evil.
   - Human reasoning is subordinate to God’s self-revelation.
   - The Bible provides both the categories and the narrative for theodicy.
   - Apparent contradictions are resolved through faithful exegesis and trust in God’s Word.
   - "Our understanding of evil and justice must be shaped by the whole counsel of God in Scripture." (The Lordship of Christ)

5. **Affirmation of Mystery and Human Limitation**
   - Full comprehension of God’s purposes in evil is beyond human capacity.
   - Mystery is not a defect but a reflection of God’s transcendence.
   - Humility is required in theological reflection on theodicy.
   - The presence of mystery leads to worship rather than skepticism.
   - "We must acknowledge the mystery of God’s ways, trusting that His justice is perfect even when hidden from us." (Logic)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s **multiperspectivalism** has significantly influenced contemporary Reformed approaches to theodicy, encouraging theologians to integrate biblical, philosophical, and existential insights. His Christ-centered and Trinitarian emphases have shaped evangelical responses to the problem of evil, especially within the Westminster tradition. By grounding theodicy in **God’s sovereignty** and the authority of Scripture, Poythress has provided a robust framework for addressing divine justice that continues to inform both academic and pastoral contexts.
