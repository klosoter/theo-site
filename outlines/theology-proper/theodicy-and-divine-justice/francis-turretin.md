# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin addressed **theodicy** and **divine justice** within the framework of **Reformed scholasticism**, emphasizing the compatibility of God's absolute sovereignty with His perfect justice. He maintained that **evil** exists under God's providence without compromising God's holiness, and he defended the **rectitude of divine justice** in both predestination and the permission of sin. Turretin's approach is marked by careful distinctions between God's **decretive will** and His **preceptive will**, upholding the justice of God in all His dealings with creation.

- "God is not the author of sin, because he neither commands nor approves it, but only permits it for wise and just reasons." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Justice is Essential and Immutable**
    - God’s **justice** is not arbitrary but rooted in His very nature.
    - Divine justice governs both **retributive** and **remunerative** acts.
    - God cannot act contrary to His justice, even in the exercise of sovereignty.
    - The justice of God is the foundation for the **moral order** of the universe.
    - "Justice is so essential to God that he cannot but punish sin." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

2. **Distinction Between Decretive and Preceptive Will**
    - God’s **decretive will** ordains all that comes to pass, including the permission of evil.
    - His **preceptive will** reveals what He commands and approves morally.
    - The distinction preserves God’s holiness while affirming His sovereignty over evil.
    - Sin occurs by God’s permission, not by His direct causation or approval.
    - "God wills sin as to the event, but not as to the fault." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

3. **Permission of Evil Without Causation**
    - God permits evil for wise, just, and holy ends, but does not cause it.
    - The permission of evil serves the greater manifestation of God’s **glory** and justice.
    - Human agents are the true and immediate causes of sin.
    - God’s providence orders evil actions without violating human responsibility.
    - "He permits evil, but does not produce it." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

4. **Vindication of Divine Justice in Predestination**
    - God’s election and reprobation are acts of **sovereign justice** and mercy.
    - No injustice is done to the reprobate, who are left in their sin by God’s just judgment.
    - The ground of condemnation is always found in the sinner, not in God.
    - Predestination magnifies both the justice and mercy of God without contradiction.
    - "God is debtor to none; his grace is free, his justice unimpeachable." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

5. **Theodicy Anchored in God’s Wisdom and Glory**
    - The ultimate purpose of permitting evil is the greater display of God’s **wisdom** and **glory**.
    - God brings good out of evil, demonstrating His providential governance.
    - The mystery of evil’s existence is resolved in the context of God’s perfect plan.
    - Human inability to fully comprehend God’s ways does not impugn His justice.
    - "What God does, he does most wisely, although we may not always see the reason." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of **divine justice** and theodicy profoundly shaped later **Reformed orthodoxy** and confessional theology. His careful distinctions and scholastic method provided a robust defense of God’s justice amid the realities of evil and predestination. Turretin’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of **theodicy**, especially in the context of **Reformed systematic theology** and debates over the compatibility of divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
