# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached **theodicy** and **divine justice** through the framework of **covenant theology**, emphasizing God's sovereign administration of justice within the structure of **covenant sanctions** and **intrusion ethics**. He argued that God's justice is displayed both in historical judgments and in the eschatological fulfillment of the **kingdom of God**, with the **curse and blessing sanctions** serving as anticipations of final judgment. Kline's distinctive contribution was to show how the patterns of divine justice in redemptive history prefigure ultimate realities, thus addressing the problem of evil within a biblical-theological context.

- "The intrusion of the power and principles of the age to come into the present world order is the key to understanding the theodicy of the Old Testament." ("Kingdom Prologue")

- Images of the Spirit
- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- Treaty of the Great King

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant Sanctions as Theodicy**
    - Divine justice is administered through **covenant blessings and curses**.
    - Historical judgments (e.g., the Flood, Canaan) are anticipations of final judgment.
    - The covenant structure provides the context for understanding God's dealings with evil.
    - Theodicy is inseparable from the outworking of **redemptive history**.
    - "The sanctions of the covenant are the historical expressions of God's justice." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Intrusion Ethics**
    - God occasionally brings **eschatological judgment** into the present as a sign of ultimate justice.
    - Events like the conquest of Canaan are not normative but exceptional "intrusions" of the age to come.
    - These intrusions serve as a theodicy, demonstrating God's justice in history.
    - They highlight the provisional and anticipatory nature of Old Testament judgments.
    - "Intrusion ethics explains the exceptional character of certain divine commands in redemptive history." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Divine Sovereignty and Justice**
    - God's justice is rooted in His absolute sovereignty over creation and history.
    - Human standards cannot be imposed upon God's actions; His justice defines all justice.
    - The problem of evil is addressed by affirming God's right to judge and redeem according to His purposes.
    - Divine justice is ultimately vindicated in the **consummation** of the kingdom.
    - "The Lord of the covenant is the sovereign Judge whose verdict alone is determinative." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Typology and Eschatology**
    - Historical judgments are **types** that point forward to the final judgment.
    - Typological patterns reveal God's consistent justice throughout redemptive history.
    - Theodicy is illuminated by seeing the unity of God's purposes from creation to consummation.
    - The eschatological hope provides the ultimate answer to the problem of evil.
    - "The typological structure of redemptive history is essential to understanding divine justice." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Christocentric Resolution of Theodicy**
    - The work of Christ fulfills the demands of divine justice through **substitutionary atonement**.
    - Jesus bears the curse sanctions of the covenant, satisfying God's justice on behalf of His people.
    - The cross is the ultimate theodicy, displaying both God's wrath against sin and His mercy.
    - The resurrection inaugurates the new creation, where justice and peace are perfectly realized.
    - "At the cross, the curse sanction is exhausted, and the blessing sanction secured for the redeemed." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline's biblical-theological approach to **theodicy** has significantly shaped Reformed discussions of **divine justice** and the interpretation of Old Testament judgment narratives. His concepts of **intrusion ethics** and covenant sanctions have provided a framework for understanding the relationship between historical and eschatological justice. Kline's influence endures in contemporary covenant theology, especially in debates about the continuity of law, ethics, and the problem of evil within redemptive history.
