# Marilyn McCord Adams (1943–2017)

Marilyn McCord Adams addressed **theodicy** by focusing on the problem of **horrendous evils** and their compatibility with **divine justice** and **goodness**. She argued that only a **personal relationship with God** can truly defeat such evils, emphasizing the necessity of **incarnation** and **redemptive participation** in human suffering. Adams rejected purely theoretical solutions, insisting that **God’s justice** must be demonstrated through concrete, transformative engagement with those who suffer.

- "God can and does defeat horrendous evils by integrating participation in them into the individual's relationship with God." (Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Horrendous evils as a central challenge to theodicy**
    - Defines horrendous evils as those that threaten to rob life of positive meaning.
    - Argues that traditional **free will** or **soul-making** theodicies are insufficient.
    - Insists that such evils raise unique questions about **divine justice**.
    - Maintains that any adequate theodicy must address the existential impact of these evils.
    "Horrendous evils call into question whether the individual's life can be a great good to them on the whole." (Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God)

2. **Defeat of evil through personal relationship with God**
    - Proposes that only participation in the **beatific vision** can outweigh horrendous evils.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of **intimate union with God** for true redemption.
    - Suggests that **God’s justice** is realized in offering this relationship to all sufferers.
    - Argues that this relationship transforms the meaning of suffering.
    "God can engulf the individual's experience of horrors in a positive relationship with Himself." (Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God)

3. **Christological solution to the problem of evil**
    - Centers the **incarnation** as God’s ultimate solidarity with human suffering.
    - Asserts that Christ’s participation in horrors is essential for **redemptive justice**.
    - Maintains that Christ’s suffering provides the paradigm for defeating evil.
    - Connects the work of Christ to the restoration of meaning for victims.
    "The coherence of Christology depends on Christ’s ability to defeat horrors in human lives." (Christ and Horrors)

4. **Critique of retributive models of divine justice**
    - Challenges the adequacy of **retributive justice** in addressing horrendous evils.
    - Argues that punishment alone cannot restore victims or defeat evil.
    - Advocates for a **restorative** and **redemptive** model of justice.
    - Emphasizes God’s commitment to healing and transformation over mere judgment.
    "Divine justice must be more than retribution; it must heal the damage done by evil." (Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God)

5. **Universal accessibility of divine defeat of evil**
    - Insists that **God’s justice** requires the possibility of redemption for all.
    - Suggests that **universalism** is a logical extension of God’s goodness and justice.
    - Argues that eternal loss would undermine the defeat of horrendous evils.
    - Maintains that God’s love and justice are inseparable in offering hope to every person.
    "If God is perfectly loving and just, then He must make defeat of horrors available to all." (Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Adams’s work on **theodicy** has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **divine justice** and the problem of evil, especially through her focus on horrendous evils. Her insistence on the necessity of a **personal relationship with God** and the centrality of **Christ’s redemptive work** has influenced both philosophical and theological approaches to suffering. By challenging retributive models and advocating for restorative justice, Adams has contributed to ongoing debates about the nature of **God’s goodness** and the scope of redemption. Her legacy endures in both analytic philosophy of religion and constructive Christian theology.
