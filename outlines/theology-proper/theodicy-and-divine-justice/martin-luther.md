# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther addressed **theodicy** and **divine justice** within the framework of God's absolute sovereignty and the radical distinction between the **hidden God (Deus absconditus)** and the **revealed God (Deus revelatus)**. He emphasized that human reason cannot fully comprehend God's justice, especially in the face of suffering and evil, and insisted that true knowledge of God's justice is found only in **Christ crucified**.

- "For God in His own nature and majesty is to be left alone; in this regard, we have nothing to do with Him, nor does He wish us to deal with Him." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Key Works

- The Bondage of the Will (De Servo Arbitrio)
- Lectures on Romans
- Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- Commentary on Genesis
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Galatians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Justice is Hidden and Revealed**
    - Distinguishes between the **hidden God** whose justice is inscrutable and the **revealed God** in Christ.
    - Asserts that God’s justice is not always evident in worldly events or human experience.
    - Human attempts to justify God apart from revelation are futile.
    - True understanding of divine justice comes through faith in the promises of the Gospel.
    - "God must be left to Himself in His own majesty, for in this respect we have nothing to do with Him." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **The Cross as the Revelation of Divine Justice**
    - The ultimate expression of God’s justice is found in the **cross of Christ**.
    - The cross reveals both God’s wrath against sin and His mercy toward sinners.
    - Human suffering and evil are interpreted through the lens of Christ’s passion.
    - The cross overturns human expectations about power and justice.
    - "He who does not know Christ does not know God hidden in suffering." (Heidelberg Disputation)

3. **Human Inability to Comprehend God’s Ways**
    - Human reason is fundamentally limited and corrupted by sin.
    - Attempts to rationalize or justify God’s actions lead to speculation and despair.
    - Faith, not reason, is the proper response to the mystery of God’s justice.
    - Luther warns against constructing rational theodicies apart from revelation.
    - "Reason cannot grasp or comprehend divine things; it is blind, deaf, and foolish in them." (Lectures on Romans)

4. **Sovereignty of God in Election and Reprobation**
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all things, including salvation and damnation.
    - Election is grounded solely in God’s mercy, not human merit.
    - The doctrine of **predestination** underscores the unsearchable nature of divine justice.
    - God remains just even when His ways are hidden from human understanding.
    - "God does not will the death of a sinner, but He wills it in a manner inscrutable to us." (The Bondage of the Will)

5. **Pastoral Emphasis on Trust in God’s Promises**
    - Encourages believers to cling to the **Word of God** and the promises of the Gospel.
    - Warns against despair when confronted with suffering or apparent injustice.
    - Consolation is found in Christ, not in speculative answers to the problem of evil.
    - The assurance of God’s justice is given through faith, not sight.
    - "Let us look to the Word and leave the hidden God alone." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s approach to **theodicy** profoundly shaped Protestant thought by emphasizing the limits of human reason and the centrality of **revelation in Christ**. His distinction between the hidden and revealed God redirected theological reflection away from speculative rationalizations and toward the cross as the locus of divine justice. This legacy influenced later **Reformed** and **Lutheran** approaches to suffering, providence, and the problem of evil, prioritizing faith in God’s promises over philosophical theodicy.
