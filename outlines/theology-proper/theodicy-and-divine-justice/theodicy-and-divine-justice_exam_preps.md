### TITLE
Theodicy, Divine Justice, and the Cross: Defending God’s Goodness without Domesticating Evil

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether and how Christian theology can affirm **divine justice** and **goodness** in the face of radical evil and suffering without denying **divine sovereignty**, **simplicity**, or the seriousness of evil.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, John Hick, Eleonore Stump.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic anti-Manichaean and Augustinian approaches, medieval scholasticism, early modern rational theism, modern analytic philosophy of religion and free-will defenses, twentieth-century eschatological and soul-making theodicies, Reformed and broader classical theism.
- Debates:
  - Internal: compatibilist versus libertarian accounts of freedom in theodicy, retributive versus restorative construals of **divine justice**, skeptical theism versus traditional theodicy projects.
  - External: Humean and evidential arguments from evil, atheistic and process critiques of **classical theism**, modern protest theologies rejecting theodicy.
  - Contemporary: horrendous evils, trauma and pastoral abuse of theodicy, analytic debates about **skeptical theism**, the cross and eschatology as limits on explanatory theodicy.
- Defended position: A cruciform Augustinian theodicy within **classical theism** that affirms meticulous **providence**, sees evil as privation ordered by God’s just and wise will to a greater manifestation of glory in Christ, refuses exhaustive explanatory mapping of particular evils, and locates ultimate resolution in eschatology rather than in fully transparent rational accounts.

### ESSAY
Theodicy, strictly defined, is the disciplined attempt to reconcile the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good God with the reality of evil and suffering, while preserving both robust **divine justice** and the genuine gravity of evil. The question presses especially urgently in a framework of **classical theism**, where God is affirmed as simple, immutable, and all-governing, so that nothing falls outside his **providence**. In that context the core challenge is sharp: if God is both able and willing to prevent any evil, why does he not in fact prevent it? Within Christian theology this issue is not marginal but touches **doctrine of God**, **creation and fall**, **providence**, **Christology**, and **eschatology**. Any theodicy that secures one locus at the expense of another is theologically unstable, and this is precisely what examiners tend to probe.

Augustine is the first decisive figure because he reframes the entire issue in metaphysical and moral terms against Manichaean dualism. As a former Manichee, Augustine knew the appeal of positing an evil principle coeternal with the good. His mature response, especially in Confessions and The City of God, binds the Christian doctrine of evil to **creatio ex nihilo** and **divine simplicity**. If God is the simple, self-sufficient good and all things other than God are created from nothing, then evil cannot be a positive substance alongside God. Augustine’s central thesis is that evil is a **privation of good** rather than a nature in its own right. Every created nature is good as such; evil is a disordering, a lack of the order or measure due to that nature. This allows him to affirm that God wills and creates only what is good, while acknowledging that rational creatures can defect from the good.

This leads to Augustine’s second major contribution: an account of evil grounded in free created will, yet under comprehensive **providence**. God created angels and humans with mutable wills capable of loving God or turning away. The first moral evil is the disordered love of self over God. Yet Augustine will not relieve theological tension by ascribing autonomy to created will in such a way that God’s decree is constrained. God foreknows and ordains the history of sin, not as its efficient cause but as its just and wise permitter, ordering even created acts of rebellion to greater goods, preeminently the display of grace in Christ. For Augustine, God’s **justice** is not compromised by permitting evil when he rightly punishes sin and mercifully redeems some sinners, so that the cosmic outcome displays a more complex harmony of justice and mercy than a sinless creation would have shown.

An examiner will often ask whether this Augustinian view makes God the author of sin or renders evil merely instrumental. Augustine’s answer rests on a scalar account of causality and order. God as first cause gives being, agency, and order, all of which are good. The defect in a sinful act is entirely from the creature; the goodness of the act’s existence and the broader order in which it is situated are from God. To say God ordains that an act occur is not to say he infuses the privation that constitutes its sinfulness. That privation is precisely a failure of conformity to the measure of goodness God intends. Augustine also insists that God’s permission of sin is governed by perfect wisdom and justice, even where his reasons are opaque to us. The classic Augustinian formula that God judged it better to bring good out of evil than to permit no evil at all points forward to Christ: the crucifixion, the greatest moral evil, becomes the site of the greatest display of **divine justice** and mercy. Any Christian theodicy that does not center the cross fails to be recognizably Augustinian.

Thomas Aquinas systematizes Augustine’s insights within scholastic **classical theism**, deepening both the metaphysical treatment of evil and its relation to **divine simplicity** and **providence**. In the Summa Theologiae Thomas develops an analogical discourse about God in which goodness, justice, and wisdom are really identical with the divine essence and only conceptually distinct for us. This has immediate implications for theodicy. It is impossible, on Aquinas’s view, that God could will something contrary to his own goodness or justice, since God is his goodness. All that God wills, he wills in one simple, eternal act, in perfect alignment with his nature. There is no tension in God between will and justice that could result in some morally dubious divine choice. The tension is entirely on the creaturely side of the relation, in our inability to see how the entire order of providence manifests divine goodness.

Aquinas follows Augustine in treating evil as **privation**, exactly correlating evil with the loss of a due perfection in a subject. Hence he insists that God cannot directly will evil as evil. God wills the good of the whole order, which, given the kind of world God has in fact created, includes the presence of defects that allow higher goods like patience, courage, justice, and merciful forgiveness to exist. Aquinas explicitly states that God wills to permit some evils for the sake of greater goods. Unlike later free-will defenses, however, Thomas does not make divine permission of evil contingent upon a libertarian conception of free will standing outside God’s decree. For him, created freedom and divine causality are compatible because God moves the will according to its nature. God’s universal causality is so transcendent that it does not compete with creaturely agency.

A typical objection here is that such a Thomistic view appears to leave no space for a morally significant sense in which God could have done otherwise, or in which particular horrendous evils are genuinely contingent under God. Aquinas’s response is located in the doctrine of **necessary and free willing in God**. God necessarily wills himself, but freely wills the created order. He could have willed a different cosmos, or no cosmos. Once he wills a particular providential order for the manifestation of his glory, that order and its details are fixed by his eternal decree. The moral question, then, is whether that decree as a whole is consistent with divine justice and wisdom. Aquinas’s line is that it must be, given **divine simplicity**. Our inability to discern the justifying reasons in detail does not impugn God’s goodness, because the divine intellect and will are not proportioned to our cognitive limits.

Leibniz is decisive because he both intensifies and partly distorts the classical Augustinian line. In his Theodicy and related works he coins the term “theodicy” and articulates the famous thesis that we inhabit the best of all possible worlds. On Leibniz’s rationalist scheme, God surveys all possible worlds and chooses to actualize that world which maximizes the ratio of good to evil, or the degree of compossible perfection. Evil is again treated as **privation**, but Leibniz emphasizes the logical constraints within which even God operates: certain goods, like free rational creatures, cannot be had without the risk or even certainty of moral evil. A world with no possibility of sin would lack certain high-order goods. God’s **justice** and goodness are vindicated by showing that any alternative feasible world would contain as much or more evil, or less good.

Leibniz thus sharpens what we might call the global optimization strategy in theodicy. This has the advantage of stressing divine wisdom and order: nothing is brute; every permission of evil has its rational place in a cosmic calculus. Yet it tends to invite precisely the mechanistic optimism satirized by Voltaire’s Candide and targeted by later critics. Does Leibniz’s position trivialize the rage of the oppressed and the horror of genocide by subsuming them under an abstract “best world” slogan? Does it treat persons as dispensable means to an end, contrary to any serious account of **divine justice**?

From the standpoint of Augustine and Aquinas, many Reformed and classical theists would affirm a moderated version of Leibniz’s insistence that God has wise and sufficient reasons for his permissions, while rejecting the pretension that those reasons are largely accessible to us via rational reconstruction. The danger is not the assertion that God orders evil to greater goods, but the illusion that theology can specify exactly what those goods are and why they could not be obtained otherwise. That rationalist overreach provokes the next decisive figure, David Hume, whose critique remains a live external challenge.

Hume, in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, gives classic expression to what is now called the evidential problem of evil. He grants, for the sake of argument, that some kind of designer might be inferred from the apparent order of the world, but insists that the mixed distribution of pleasure and pain, the vast amount of apparently gratuitous suffering, and the crude means by which goods are achieved render implausible the claim that this designer is both omnipotent and morally perfect. Hume presses empirical counterevidence against Leibnizian optimism: if this is the best possible world, it is a strangely bungled best. More radically, Hume challenges the whole project of theodicy by attacking our ability to infer necessary connections, or divine attributes, from the empirical data at all. The existence and distribution of evil undercut arguments from design to a morally perfect deity.

Hume’s critique forces classical theists to clarify whether they are engaged in a rational defense or a positive theodicy. A defense aims only to show that belief in God is not irrational in light of evil, by displaying a broadly coherent framework in which God and evil coexist. It does not claim to know God’s specific reasons. A theodicy proper aims to give positive accounts of why God permits particular evils. In light of Hume and subsequent developments, many contemporary theists restrict themselves to defense, or combine limited explanatory theodicy with **skeptical theism**, the view that God may well have justifying reasons for permitting evils that lie beyond our cognitive horizon.

John Hick represents a modern attempt to recover a positive theodicy, explicitly rejecting the Augustinian fall narrative. In Evil and the God of Love, Hick develops an Irenaean or “soul-making” model. For Hick, God’s aim in creation is not simply a static paradise but the formation of mature moral and spiritual persons in communion with him. This requires an epistemic distance from God and an environment in which genuine moral choices, risks, and the development of virtues like courage and compassion are possible. Hick adopts libertarian freedom as a key element: if God were to override the consequences of our choices or prevent suffering too readily, the world would not be an arena for soul-making but a toy theater. Many evils are thus recast as necessary conditions for the achievement of the higher good of person-making.

Hick’s proposal shifts the axis of divine justice from retribution for sin to eschatological completion. The justice of God consists not primarily in punishing evil but in eventually bringing all persons to perfection, a move that aligns with his universalism. This sharply diverges from Augustine’s and Aquinas’s emphasis on eternal punishment as an aspect of **divine justice** and raises internal Christian debates about hell, the seriousness of sin, and the cross. Does Hick’s model dilute evil by assimilating it too quickly into soul-making? Does it underwrite the protest of victims, or does it risk telling them that their suffering is simply the raw material for someone else’s virtue?

Eleonore Stump, as a contemporary analytic Thomist, works at the intersection of these traditions and debates. In Wandering in Darkness, she offers a narrative-centered theodicy that combines **classical theism**, Aquinas’s metaphysics, and deep attention to particular cases, including biblical narratives of Job, Samson, and Mary of Bethany. Stump insists that God’s primary aim is not abstract goods but personal union with himself, a union that requires the healing of disordered desires and loves in the human soul. Drawing explicit distinctions between “defense-level” and “theodicy-level” claims, she maintains something like **skeptical theism** about our ability to know God’s reasons in detail, while arguing that it is nonetheless rational to trust that God acts for the good of individuals he loves.

Stump’s crucial contribution is her emphasis on “Franciscan” knowledge, the personal and narrative understanding of how suffering can be part of a person’s redemptive journey toward God. She does not say that all suffering is individually tailor-made by God to produce virtues, but rather that in a fallen world whose general structure God allows, God can and does work within the particularities of each life to bring about deeper intimacy and healing, often through suffering that strips away false attachments. On her Thomistic foundation, she preserves **divine simplicity** and comprehensive **providence**, yet resists both Leibnizian rational calculus and Hick’s global soul-making generalizations. She also highlights horrendous evils and trauma as contexts in which only Christ’s identification with sufferers in the passion and the eschatological promise of resurrection can render trust in **divine justice** intellectually and existentially tenable.

With these figures in view, a Christian theodicy adequate for Westminster-level scrutiny must navigate several internal debates. One is the tension between compatibilist and libertarian accounts of freedom in relation to **providence**. Augustine, Aquinas, and most of the Reformed tradition are compatibilists: God’s determining causality and human responsibility are compatible, though not fully comprehensible. Hick, by contrast, presupposes libertarian freedom that constrains divine control. My defended position aligns with an Augustinian compatibilism: human willing is genuinely responsible and morally assessable, yet always under the sovereign decree of God. This allows us to affirm that every particular instance of evil falls within the eternal plan of God, without collapsing God into the immediate moral source of evil.

Examiners will press whether this compatibilism avoids fatalism. The answer lies in distinguishing the necessity of the consequence from the necessity of the consequent. Given God’s decree, it is necessary that events unfold as he has willed, but the mode in which rational creatures participate remains voluntary, not coerced. The decree encompasses free acts as free. The mystery here is not a logical contradiction but our ignorance of how the first cause moves secondary causes according to their natures.

Another internal debate concerns the nature of **divine justice** itself. Is justice primarily retributive, giving to each what is due, or restorative, healing broken relations? Augustine and Aquinas affirm that God’s justice includes the punishment of sin as an ordered rectification of the moral order and the vindication of his own holiness. Yet even for them, justice is not opposed to mercy; rather, God’s mercy presupposes and perfects justice, especially in the cross where Christ bears the penalty of sin. Modern theodicies that downplay retributive elements risk undercutting the significance of Christ’s atonement and the biblical reality of judgment. I defend a view in which **divine justice** is both retributive and restorative: God must oppose and punish evil, but does so in a way that aims at cosmic restoration in Christ, including the vindication of victims and the final putting right of all wrongs at the last judgment.

This connects theodicy to Christology and eschatology. Any Christian defense of God’s justice in the face of evil must be Christocentric and eschatological. The cross is the paradigmatic case in which God permits the worst evil, ordained within his plan, in order to accomplish the greatest good, the redemption of his people and the revelation of his righteousness. Human suffering can be related analogically, not identically, to Christ’s passion: not every evil is salvific, but no evil is beyond God’s ability to weave into his redemptive purposes. Eschatologically, the book of Revelation and Pauline eschatology promise a final judgment and a renewed creation where every tear is wiped away. This promise is not a sentimental add-on but a structural pillar of Christian theodicy. Without resurrection and final judgment, any talk of justification of God in the face of Auschwitz is blasphemous; with it, we still cannot “explain” Auschwitz but can say that God will publicly judge its perpetrators, vindicate its victims, and transform the cosmos so that, in Augustine’s words, the citizens of the heavenly city remember past evils without pain, seeing them as the dark elements woven into the tapestry of divine glory.

External critiques, beginning with Hume and extending through modern protest theology, accuse all such theodicies of trivializing suffering. In the wake of the Holocaust, some Jewish and Christian thinkers reject theodicy entirely as morally obscene, arguing that evil must be confronted with lament and protest, not explanation. Process theologians and open theists modify the doctrine of God, denying either divine omnipotence or exhaustive foreknowledge, so that God is absolved from responsibility for evils he did not ordain and could not unilaterally prevent. These moves resolve the logical tension by sacrificing **classical theism**.

On the defended position, such revisions are theologically too costly. They conflict with Scripture and with doctrines like **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **providence**, and they do not in fact satisfy the moral protest, since a God who tries but fails to prevent genocide is hardly more worship-worthy. Christian faith claims that God is the Lord who could have prevented every evil and yet, for wise and just reasons, did not. The moral scandal of this claim is what drives us to the cross, where God himself in the person of the Son enters into the depths of suffering and bears the judgment that divine justice requires. Theodicy must thus be chastened: it cannot be a detached rational exercise but must be conducted coram Deo, under the shadow of Golgotha.

Contemporary discussions of horrendous evils and trauma expose the limits of abstract theodicies. Horrendous evils, as defined by some analytic philosophers, are those whose participation can prima facie destroy the meaning of a person’s life. A responsible theodicy will not tell such sufferers that their trauma is simply a stepping stone to greater goods. Instead, following Stump’s narrative emphasis and Augustine’s theology of grace, we should say: in Christ, God is able to so heal, re-contextualize, and redeem even horrendous suffering that the person, in the eschatological presence of God, can come to see her life as, on the whole, a great good to her, without erasing the objective wickedness of the evil committed against her. This is not something we can map now but something promised in union with the crucified and risen Lord.

Where, then, do we land? The position defended is a cruciform Augustinian theodicy within **classical theism**. It affirms that God, who is simple, immutable, omnipotent, and all-good, eternally decrees and governs all things, including the permissions of evil. Evil is a **privation of good** located in the will of creatures; God is never the author of sin. God’s **justice** is displayed in the punishment of sin and the vindication of his holiness, and his mercy is displayed in the redemption of the elect through Christ’s atoning work. Every particular evil is permitted by God for wise and just reasons ordered to his glory and the ultimate good of his people, though those reasons are rarely transparent to us. The cross and resurrection are the central revelation of how God can bring unsurpassable good out of maximal evil, and eschatological judgment and renewal of creation are essential for any morally adequate account of divine justice. While we can give coherent models and rebut specific objections, we must also embrace **analogical knowledge** and **skeptical theism** at the level of specific explanations, acknowledging that much of God’s providential reasoning transcends our grasp.

Examiners will press whether this stance collapses into fideism. It does not, because it offers principled reasons for trusting God’s character based on revelation in Christ and a coherent metaphysical account of God, creation, and evil. They will ask whether calling evil a privation diminishes its reality. It does not, because privation is not nonbeing but a real and grave disorder in real entities, fully capable of inflicting profound suffering. They will question whether affirming that God ordains all things leaves room for sincere lament and protest. It does, because the Psalms and Christ’s own cry of dereliction model faithful protest addressed to the sovereign God. It is precisely because God reigns that lament is meaningful. In the end, Christian theodicy does not exonerate God before a human court but teaches the church to confess, even through tears, that the judge of all the earth will do right, and that his **divine justice** and goodness are most clearly displayed not in a world without evil, but in the crucified and risen Son who overcomes evil with good.

- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: evil as **privation**, free created will under sovereign decree, God ordering evil to greater goods culminating in Christ.
  - Aquinas: **divine simplicity**, analogical discourse, evil as permitted defect within a wisely ordered whole, compatibilist providence.
  - Leibniz: rational “best of all possible worlds” optimization, evil as necessary for maximal overall good, risk of rationalistic overreach.
  - Hume: evidential critique of theodicy, empirical challenge to inferring a morally perfect God from a world of mixed good and evil.
  - Hick: Irenaean “soul-making” theodicy, libertarian freedom, universalist and eschatological emphasis on person-making.
  - Stump: Thomistic, narrative-based theodicy, focus on personal union with God, partial **skeptical theism**, attention to horrendous evils.
- Debates:
  - Internal: compatibilist versus libertarian freedom; retributive versus restorative **divine justice**; explanatory theodicy versus **skeptical theism**; Augustinian fall-narrative versus Irenaean soul-making.
  - External: Humean evidential problem of evil; protest and post-Holocaust theology rejecting theodicy; process and open theist revisions of **classical theism**.
  - Contemporary: horrendous evils and trauma; pastoral misuse of theodicy; cross and eschatology as the true horizon for vindicating **divine justice**.
- Defended position: A cruciform Augustinian theodicy within **classical theism**, affirming meticulous **providence** and **divine simplicity**, seeing evil as privation permitted and ordered by God to greater goods supremely revealed in the cross and resurrection, refusing exhaustive explanations of particular evils and locating ultimate resolution in eschatological judgment and restoration.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Does Augustinian compatibilism make God the author of sin? No, because God gives being and order while the privation constituting sin arises solely from the creaturely will.
  - Does privation theory trivialize suffering? No, it locates evil as a real and grave disorder in good creatures, fully accounting for the depth of suffering.
  - Why not adopt open theism or process views to protect God’s goodness? Because they contradict Scripture and **classical theism** and do not, in fact, secure a more worship-worthy God.
  - How does the cross function in your theodicy? As the paradigmatic case where God permits the worst evil to achieve the greatest good, revealing both **divine justice** and mercy.
  - What role does skeptical theism play? It limits claims about knowing God’s specific reasons for particular evils while preserving trust in his revealed character and overarching purposes.
