# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **theodicy** and **divine justice** through his distinctive **tri-perspectivalism**, emphasizing the coherence of God's sovereignty, goodness, and wisdom. He insists that all attempts to justify God's ways must begin with **Scripture** as the ultimate authority, affirming both the reality of evil and the absolute **righteousness** of God. Frame maintains that human understanding of **divine justice** is always subordinate to God's self-revelation and covenant purposes.

- "God’s justice is not subject to a standard outside himself; rather, his own nature is the ultimate standard of justice." ("The Doctrine of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Apologetics to the Glory of God (1994)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- Perspectives on the Word of God (1990)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty and the Problem of Evil**
   - Evil exists within the comprehensive plan of God, yet God remains unstained by evil.
   - God ordains all that comes to pass, including evil, for wise and just purposes.
   - Human responsibility is upheld alongside divine sovereignty.
   - The mystery of evil is ultimately resolved in God’s character and purposes.
   - "God brings good out of evil, and his sovereignty is never compromised by the existence of evil." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Scripture as the Norm for Theodicy**
   - Scripture provides the authoritative framework for understanding evil and justice.
   - Human philosophical attempts at theodicy are subordinate to biblical revelation.
   - The biblical narrative centers on God’s redemptive response to evil.
   - The cross of Christ is the ultimate demonstration of God’s justice and mercy.
   - "We must let Scripture, not philosophy, set the terms for our understanding of God’s justice." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Tri-Perspectival Approach to Divine Justice**
   - Justice is understood through normative (God’s law), situational (God’s providence), and existential (human experience) perspectives.
   - Each perspective is interdependent and necessary for a full account of theodicy.
   - Divine justice is not abstract but relational and covenantal.
   - The tri-perspectival method guards against reductionism in theodicy.
   - "God’s justice is best understood when we consider his law, his works in history, and our personal response together." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Christocentric Resolution of Theodicy**
   - The person and work of Christ are central to resolving questions of evil and justice.
   - The atonement demonstrates both the seriousness of sin and the depth of God’s justice.
   - Christ’s suffering provides the ultimate answer to the problem of innocent suffering.
   - Redemption is the lens through which all evil and suffering are ultimately judged.
   - "The cross is where God’s justice and mercy meet most clearly." (Apologetics to the Glory of God)

5. **The Creator-Creature Distinction**
   - God’s ways are ultimately inscrutable to finite creatures.
   - Human judgments about justice must be humble and receptive to divine revelation.
   - The Creator-creature distinction safeguards against anthropocentric theodicies.
   - God’s justice is defined by his own character, not by external standards.
   - "We must remember that God is not answerable to us; his justice is the standard, not ours." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s approach to **theodicy** and **divine justice** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially through his emphasis on **tri-perspectivalism** and the authority of Scripture. His insistence on the centrality of Christ and the Creator-creature distinction has provided a robust framework for addressing the problem of evil within a confessional context. Frame’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking a biblically grounded response to the challenges of evil and suffering.
