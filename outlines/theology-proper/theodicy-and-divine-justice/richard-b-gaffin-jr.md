# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches **theodicy** and **divine justice** through the lens of **redemptive history** and the centrality of **union with Christ**. He emphasizes that God's justice is most fully revealed in the **death and resurrection of Christ**, where the problem of evil is addressed not through abstract speculation but through the concrete accomplishment of **salvation** in history.

- "The resurrection is the pivotal event in the history of redemption, the decisive manifestation of God’s justice and victory over sin and death." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (in The Glory of the Atonement, eds. Hill & Letham)
- "The Work of Christ Applied" (in The Faith Once Delivered, eds. Garner & Strange)
- Perspectives on Pentecost

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theodicy is Christocentric**
    - The problem of evil is addressed primarily in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the definitive vindication of **divine justice**.
    - The cross demonstrates both God’s justice against sin and his mercy toward sinners.
    - Theodicy is inseparable from the historical accomplishment of redemption.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the public declaration of God’s righteousness." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Redemptive-Historical Framework**
    - Theodicy must be understood within the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - God’s justice is progressively revealed from creation to consummation.
    - The problem of evil is not solved abstractly but through God’s acts in history.
    - The final resolution of evil awaits the consummation at Christ’s return.
    - "The history of redemption is the history of God’s justice being revealed and accomplished." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Union with Christ as the Solution**
    - Believers participate in Christ’s victory over evil through **union with Christ**.
    - Justification and sanctification are grounded in this union, displaying divine justice.
    - The believer’s suffering is interpreted in light of participation in Christ’s sufferings and resurrection.
    - Theodicy is thus existentially appropriated in the life of the church.
    - "All the benefits of salvation, including vindication over evil, flow from union with the resurrected Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Eschatological Vindication**
    - Full **divine justice** will be manifest only at the final judgment.
    - Present suffering and evil are temporary and await eschatological resolution.
    - The resurrection is the firstfruits of the final defeat of evil.
    - Theodicy is ultimately forward-looking, grounded in God’s promises.
    - "The resurrection points forward to the day when God’s justice will be universally manifest." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Scripture as the Norm for Theodicy**
    - Theodicy must be shaped by the **biblical narrative**, not philosophical speculation.
    - Scripture presents God’s justice as both retributive and restorative.
    - The problem of evil is addressed through God’s self-revelation in Christ.
    - The church must resist attempts to solve theodicy apart from the gospel.
    - "Any adequate theodicy must be rooted in the self-attesting authority of Scripture." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by insisting that theodicy and divine justice are inseparable from the historical and eschatological realities of the gospel. His Christ-centered, redemptive-historical approach has influenced generations of pastors and theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. By rooting theodicy in **union with Christ** and the resurrection, Gaffin has provided a robust biblical framework for addressing the problem of evil that avoids speculative solutions and remains grounded in the drama of redemption.
