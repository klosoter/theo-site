# Gregory E. Ganssle (1960– )

Gregory E. Ganssle approaches **theodicy** and **divine justice** by emphasizing the coherence of **Christian theism** in the face of **evil**. He argues that the existence of evil does not undermine the rationality of belief in a **good and just God**, but rather invites deeper reflection on the nature of **God’s purposes** and the limits of human understanding. Ganssle is known for his analytic clarity and engagement with both classical and contemporary arguments regarding the **problem of evil**.

- "The presence of evil in the world is not logically incompatible with the existence of the God of Christian theism." (Thinking About God)

## Key Works

- Thinking About God: First Steps in Philosophy
- God and Time: Essays on the Divine Nature (editor)
- God and the Reach of Reason: C.S. Lewis, David Hume, and Bertrand Russell
- A Reasonable God: Engaging the New Face of Atheism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Evil is not logically incompatible with God’s existence**
    - Argues that the **logical problem of evil** fails to demonstrate a contradiction between God and evil.
    - Emphasizes the distinction between logical and evidential versions of the problem.
    - Draws on **Plantinga’s free will defense** to show possible reasons for God permitting evil.
    - Maintains that Christian theism remains rational in light of evil’s existence.
    - "There is no contradiction in affirming both that God exists and that evil exists." (Thinking About God)

2. **God’s justice is ultimately inscrutable**
    - Asserts that human limitations prevent full comprehension of **divine justice**.
    - Suggests that God’s purposes may transcend human moral categories.
    - Encourages epistemic humility when evaluating God’s reasons for permitting suffering.
    - Points to biblical narratives where God’s justice is revealed over time.
    - "We should not expect to grasp all of God’s reasons for allowing evil." (A Reasonable God)

3. **Theodicy is a cumulative, not a single-argument, enterprise**
    - Advocates for a **cumulative case** approach to theodicy, integrating multiple considerations.
    - Uses both philosophical reasoning and theological resources to address the problem.
    - Recognizes the role of **Christian doctrines** such as the Fall and redemption.
    - Engages with both classical and contemporary responses to evil.
    - "No single answer will suffice; theodicy is a tapestry woven from many threads." (God and the Reach of Reason)

4. **God’s goodness is compatible with permitting evil for greater goods**
    - Argues that God may allow evil to bring about **greater goods** or morally significant outcomes.
    - Cites examples such as the development of virtues and the possibility of genuine relationships.
    - Affirms that some goods require the possibility of evil (e.g., free will).
    - Maintains that God’s ultimate purposes are oriented toward **redemption**.
    - "Some goods can only be achieved in a world where evil is possible." (Thinking About God)

5. **Christian hope reframes the problem of evil**
    - Emphasizes the role of **eschatological hope** in Christian responses to suffering.
    - Points to the promise of final justice and restoration in Christian eschatology.
    - Argues that the resurrection and new creation provide context for understanding present evils.
    - Encourages believers to trust in God’s ultimate vindication of justice.
    - "Christian hope transforms how we face the reality of evil and suffering." (A Reasonable God)

## Legacy and Impact

Ganssle’s work has contributed significantly to contemporary **analytic philosophy of religion**, especially in clarifying the coherence of **theodicy** within Christian thought. His engagement with both classical arguments and modern atheism has provided resources for defending the rationality of faith in a just God. By emphasizing epistemic humility and the cumulative nature of theodicy, Ganssle has influenced both academic and popular discussions on **divine justice** and the problem of evil.
