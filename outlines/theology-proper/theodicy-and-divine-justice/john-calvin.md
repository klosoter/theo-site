# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin addressed **theodicy** and **divine justice** within the framework of God’s absolute **sovereignty** and **providence**. He maintained that God is perfectly just, even when permitting or ordaining evil, and that human inability to fully comprehend divine purposes does not impugn God’s righteousness. Calvin’s approach emphasizes the **Creator-creature distinction** and the ultimate inscrutability of God’s will.

- "But the will of God is the supreme rule of justice; so that what he wills must be considered just for the very reason that he wills it." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, III.23.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 16–18; Book III, chapters 21–24)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on Romans (notably Romans 9)
- Sermons on Job
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)
- Calvin’s Letters (selected correspondence on providence and suffering)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty Over All Events**
    - God ordains all things, including evil, according to his sovereign will.
    - Nothing occurs by chance; all is governed by divine providence.
    - God’s sovereignty does not negate human responsibility.
    - Evil is permitted for wise and just purposes, even if hidden from human understanding.
    - "Nothing happens but what is knowingly and willingly decreed by Him." (Institutes I.16.3)

2. **Divine Justice Is Inviolable**
    - God is the standard of justice; his actions define what is just.
    - Human judgments about justice are subordinate to God’s revealed character.
    - Apparent injustices in the world do not compromise God’s righteousness.
    - God’s justice is often mysterious but never arbitrary or capricious.
    - "God’s will is so much the highest rule of righteousness that whatever He wills, by the very fact that He wills it, must be considered righteous." (Institutes III.23.2)

3. **The Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God’s ways are higher than human ways; his purposes may be inscrutable.
    - Humans must approach divine mysteries with humility and reverence.
    - The finite cannot fully comprehend the infinite, especially in matters of justice and evil.
    - Faith seeks understanding but accepts the limits of human reason.
    - "Let us not be ashamed to be ignorant in a matter in which ignorance is learning." (Institutes III.21.2)

4. **Providence and Secondary Causes**
    - God works through secondary causes without being the author of sin.
    - Evil actions are truly willed by creatures, yet governed by God’s providence.
    - God’s use of evil for good does not implicate him in moral evil.
    - The distinction between proximate and ultimate causes safeguards divine holiness.
    - "Men do nothing save at the secret instigation of God, and do not discuss and deliberate on anything but what he has previously decreed with himself and brings to pass by his secret direction." (Institutes I.18.1)

5. **Redemptive Purpose in Suffering**
    - Suffering and evil serve God’s redemptive plan for his people.
    - Trials are used to discipline, sanctify, and draw believers closer to God.
    - The ultimate resolution of evil and injustice is found in Christ’s work and final judgment.
    - Believers are called to trust God’s goodness in the midst of suffering.
    - "For the Lord tries his people by adversity, and proves them by afflictions." (Commentary on Job)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust articulation of **divine sovereignty** and justice shaped the Reformed tradition’s approach to theodicy, emphasizing God’s righteousness even amid inscrutable evil. His insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the limits of human understanding continues to influence contemporary discussions of providence and suffering. Calvin’s thought remains foundational for Reformed theology, providing a framework for affirming God’s justice without diminishing his sovereignty or holiness.
