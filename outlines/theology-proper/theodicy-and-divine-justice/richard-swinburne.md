# Richard Swinburne (1934–)

Richard Swinburne is a leading proponent of **philosophical theism** and has offered influential arguments regarding **theodicy** and **divine justice**. He defends the rationality of belief in a **good God** despite the existence of **evil**, arguing that suffering can be reconciled with God's purposes within a framework of **free will** and **soul-making**.

- "If God is to allow men to share in his creative activity, he must let them bring about good and evil by their own choices." ("The Existence of God")

## Key Works

- The Existence of God (1979, revised 2004)
- Providence and the Problem of Evil (1998)
- Is There a God? (1996)
- Faith and Reason (1981)
- Responsibility and Atonement (1989)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theodicy as Rational Defense**
    - Argues that **the existence of evil** does not logically contradict the existence of an **omnibenevolent God**.
    - Seeks to provide **probabilistic arguments** for God's goodness in light of suffering.
    - Emphasizes the importance of **philosophical rigor** in addressing the problem of evil.
    - Maintains that theodicy is a necessary part of **rational theism**.
    - "The existence of evil is not logically incompatible with the existence of God." (The Existence of God)

2. **Free Will as a Greater Good**
    - Asserts that **human freedom** is a necessary condition for genuine moral responsibility.
    - Claims that the possibility of **moral evil** is a consequence of granting free will.
    - Argues that a world with free agents is more valuable than one without.
    - Suggests that **divine justice** allows for the risk of evil for the sake of greater goods.
    - "God cannot give us the great goods of responsibility and freedom without allowing the possibility of evil." (Is There a God?)

3. **Soul-Making Theodicy**
    - Draws on the **Irenaean tradition** to argue that suffering enables **spiritual growth**.
    - Views earthly life as a context for developing virtues such as courage and compassion.
    - Maintains that **divine justice** is compatible with allowing suffering for soul-making.
    - Holds that God’s providence is oriented toward the ultimate good of moral development.
    - "Evil is permitted by God as a necessary condition for the development of souls." (Providence and the Problem of Evil)

4. **Probabilistic Approach to Divine Justice**
    - Utilizes **Bayesian reasoning** to assess the likelihood of God’s existence given evil.
    - Argues that the presence of evil only slightly lowers the probability of a good God.
    - Suggests that **divine justice** is best understood in probabilistic, not deductive, terms.
    - Maintains that the overall evidence still favors theism.
    - "The existence of evil makes the existence of God less probable, but not improbable." (The Existence of God)

5. **Eschatological Resolution**
    - Affirms that ultimate **divine justice** will be realized in the afterlife.
    - Argues that suffering and injustice in this life can be rectified by God’s final judgment.
    - Suggests that eternal life provides the context for the fulfillment of justice.
    - Maintains that **theodicy** must include an eschatological perspective.
    - "God can compensate for suffering in this life by happiness in the next." (Providence and the Problem of Evil)

## Legacy and Impact

Swinburne’s rigorous defense of **theodicy** has shaped contemporary debates in **analytic philosophy of religion**, especially regarding the rationality of belief in God amid evil. His probabilistic and evidential approach to **divine justice** has provided a framework for both critics and defenders of theism. Swinburne’s work continues to influence discussions on the compatibility of **free will**, suffering, and the goodness of God.
