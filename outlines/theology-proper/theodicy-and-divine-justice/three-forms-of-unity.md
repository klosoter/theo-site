# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust **Reformed doctrine of God** that addresses **theodicy** and **divine justice** within the framework of **God’s sovereignty**, **human depravity**, and **Christ’s atonement**. These confessions uphold that God is perfectly just and good, even as He ordains all things, including suffering and evil, for His own **glory** and the ultimate good of His people. The mystery of **providence** and the assurance of **justification by faith** are central to their approach to the problem of evil.

- "God is not the author of the sins which are committed, nor can He be charged with them." (Canons of Dort, I.15)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 13, 16, 20
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 26, 27, 37, 56, 60
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. I.15, III/IV.8, V.1–3

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty and Providence**
   - God upholds and governs all things by His eternal counsel and providence.
   - Nothing happens by chance; all events serve His wise purposes.
   - God’s sovereignty does not make Him the author of sin.
   - Human responsibility is upheld alongside divine ordination.
   - "Nothing happens in this world without His appointment." (Belgic Confession, Art. 13)

2. **Divine Justice and Goodness**
   - God is perfectly just, punishing sin as it deserves.
   - His justice is never in conflict with His goodness and mercy.
   - The punishment of the wicked and the salvation of the elect both display His justice.
   - God’s justice is satisfied only through Christ’s atoning work.
   - "God is indeed merciful, but He is also just." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 11)

3. **Human Depravity and Responsibility**
   - Humanity fell into sin by its own willful disobedience.
   - All people are by nature deserving of God’s just wrath.
   - God’s justice is vindicated in condemning sinners who persist in unbelief.
   - The confessions reject any notion that God is to blame for human sin.
   - "God... leaves the non-elect in their own wickedness and obduracy." (Canons of Dort, I.15)

4. **Christ’s Atonement as the Answer to Divine Justice**
   - Christ bore the full penalty of sin to satisfy divine justice.
   - Justification is by faith alone in Christ’s finished work.
   - The atonement demonstrates both God’s justice and mercy.
   - Believers are assured that their sins are fully forgiven in Christ.
   - "God will have His justice satisfied: and therefore we must make full satisfaction, either by ourselves, or by another." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 12)

5. **The Mystery and Comfort of Providence**
   - God’s ways are often inscrutable to human understanding.
   - Believers are called to trust God’s goodness even amid suffering and evil.
   - The confessions emphasize comfort in God’s fatherly hand over all things.
   - The ultimate resolution of evil is found in God’s final judgment and restoration.
   - "We trust Him so completely as to have no doubt that He will provide for us." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 26)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed theodicy**, providing a confessional anchor for understanding **divine justice** in the face of evil and suffering. Their careful balance of **God’s sovereignty** and human responsibility continues to inform Reformed responses to the problem of evil. These documents remain foundational for Reformed churches worldwide, offering both doctrinal clarity and pastoral comfort regarding God’s justice and providence. Their influence endures in theological education, preaching, and the lived faith of Reformed communities.
