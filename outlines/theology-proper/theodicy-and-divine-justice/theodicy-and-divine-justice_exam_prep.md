### TITLE
Justice, Providence, and Privation: A Christologically bounded theodicy under classical theism

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: whether and how God’s **divine justice** and **providence** can be coherently affirmed amid moral and natural evil without abandoning **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and human responsibility.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Alvin Plantinga, William Rowe.
- Traditions engaged: Augustinian–patristic anti-Manicheanism; medieval scholastic classical theism; Reformed orthodox **federal theology** and **compatibilist freedom**; analytic philosophy of religion.
- Debates:
  - Internal: decree and permission, authorship-of-sin worry, supralapsarian versus infralapsarian order, whether to build a theodicy or rest with a defense plus **analogical knowledge**.
  - External: logical and evidential atheology, open theism and process theism, Hick’s soul-making.
  - Contemporary: horrendous evils, divine hiddenness, animal suffering within evolutionary history, the ethics of lament.
- Position: An Augustinian–Thomist account of evil as **privation** under **primary and secondary causality**, integrated with Reformed **compatibilism** and a Christocentric, eschatological horizon; deploy Plantinga’s defense to block the logical argument from evil, reject Leibnizian optimism, adopt modest skeptical theism about God’s specific reasons, and anchor **divine justice** in the cross and final **eschatological judgment**.

### ESSAY
Theodicy names a theological task as much as a philosophical one: giving an account of God’s **divine justice** in a world where evil is real and devastates. Formally, theodicy asks how affirmations about God’s goodness, wisdom, and **providence** are coherent with the reality of moral and natural evil. It borders doctrines of God, creation, sin, and redemption; done well, it remains tethered to **divine simplicity** and **impassibility**, to **primary and secondary causality**, and to Christ and the last judgment. The core claim I will defend is that evil is a **privation** of the good within a created order upheld by God’s universal causality while not authored by him; that God permits evil for just and wise reasons tied to the manifestation of mercy and justice in Christ within the history of the **covenant**; that human agents act with **compatibilist freedom** and bear responsibility; that we should not claim to inventory God’s detailed reasons but can offer category-level reasons grounded in Scripture and classical theism; and that the cross and **eschatological judgment** disclose the form of **divine justice** without rendering particular evils morally necessary. To reach that conclusion, I consider Augustine, Aquinas, Leibniz, Plantinga, and Rowe as decisive shapers of the field.

Augustine’s context was polemical and pastoral: against the dualism of Manicheism and the skepticism of the Academy, he sought in City of God and other works to reframe evil as a creaturely corruption, not as a coeternal substance rivaling God. The keystone is the doctrine of evil as **privation of evil** understood as privation of due good, not sheer nonbeing but a parasitic lack within substances that are good insofar as they exist. Against Manichean metaphysical twoism, Augustine argues that all being as such is good, and therefore evil cannot be a thing; it is the curving-in of will, a disorder of loves, an absence of rectitude. This metaphysical move is not cosmetic. It preserves God’s goodness and simplicity by denying that evil requires a positive cause. As Augustine puts it, whenever we probe the cause of an evil will, we run into a lack rather than a thing. The practical dividends are twofold. First, human responsibility is sharpened because evil action is not reducible to a fate or substance but is a voluntary turning from God. Second, God’s permission of sin can be interpreted as wise and just because the order of goods includes the good of just punishment and merciful healing. Augustine is famous for the judgment that God judged it better to bring good out of evil than to permit no evil at all. Examiners sometimes press: does this entail Leibnizian optimism or make sin a necessary stepping stone to higher goods, thereby implicating God? Augustine’s framework resists both. By construing evil as lack, he denies that evil adds any positive contribution to the world’s value. The good God brings from evil is good despite evil, not because evil contains hidden positive value. Moreover, the claim that God can bring good from evil is a modal claim about divine wisdom, not a entailment that this is the best world simpliciter. Augustine thus relocates theodicy into the order of providence without assigning evil a causative role in God. Architecturally, Augustine also plants the seed of a Christological theodicy: the cross is the supreme case of God bringing good from evil without sharing in the guilt of the perpetrators. The point is not triumphant consolation but doctrinal coherence: under the cross, **divine justice** and mercy are jointly magnified, and creaturely guilt is neither erased nor metabolized into a metaphysical good.

Thomas Aquinas develops Augustine’s insight within a metaphysically disciplined doctrine of God. In the Summa Theologiae and Summa Contra Gentiles, he ties the problem of evil to **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **primary and secondary causality**. God as ipsum esse subsistens is pure act, without composition, change, or passive potency. In such a God there can be no admixture of evil. God’s causality is universal and interior to all effects, but it is mode-specified by the nature of secondary causes. Evil arises not from the universal cause as such, but from the deficiency of secondary causes. The murderer’s act has being from God, but its moral deformity is from the deficient will of the agent. Aquinas thereby secures two requirements: that divine universal causality is not in competition with creaturely agency, and that moral evil’s formal ratio is not positively caused by God. He differentiates between God willing the antecedent good of the order of creation and permitting the consequent evils that attend finite secondary causality. The metaphysical glue is the good of order: a universe with many grades of finite goods is better, ceteris paribus, than a world with fewer. With multiplicity comes the possibility of defect, and God permits defects for the sake of the overall order where some goods, especially justice and mercy, are displayed. Here examiners often interject: does Aquinas smuggle a consequentialist calculus into divine ethics, treating creaturely suffering as expendable for aesthetic balance? Aquinas does not envision God as a moral agent deliberating under uncertainty, weighing costs and benefits. God’s will is identical with his simple goodness and wisdom; permission is not calculation but the eternal ordination of an order within which created agents act according to natures that, being finite, can defect. The good of order is not a traded-off compensation but an ontological principle of how goods cohere in a whole. Moreover, Aquinas insists that God has no need of evil to manifest his goodness and yet freely wills a world in which he permits evil for just reasons. The asymmetry between primary and secondary cause—where God is the cause of the act’s being but not its moral deformity—remains the crucial hinge against the author-of-sin charge. If an examiner presses the famous objection that on classical theism God determines the act’s every detail and so must determine its deformity, the Thomist turns to the modal analysis of defect: what makes it evil is precisely a failure of conformity to right reason, and failure is not a positive entity caused by God but an absence rooted in a finite will’s disordered end. This is not verbal legerdemain; it is the only way to reconcile universal causality with the reality of defect without setting up God as one secondary cause among others.

Leibniz coins the very term theodicy in his Essais de Théodicée. He construes the problem as reconciling God’s perfect goodness, wisdom, and power with the existence of evil by appealing to a maximality principle: God created the best of all possible worlds, the one with the optimal balance of goods, including permission of sin if and only if the total outcome is superior. Leibniz deploys compossibility and pre-established harmony to orchestrate a world of pre-synchronized substances without causal interaction, which, he argues, yields a maximal universe God must choose if he acts wisely. Leibniz’s project is decisive historically because he sets the conversation in terms of world-optimality and vindicates God by ranking total outcomes. For a Reformed classical theist, the gain is a disciplined insistence on divine wisdom’s sufficiency to justify permission. The liabilities are also sharp. First, the best-world thesis risks projecting human calculi into God’s simple act, inviting the picture of God under normative constraint to select the maximal total. Second, the aesthetic reading of permission easily slides into the claim that every particular evil is a necessary ingredient in an overall good. The Christian tradition, including Augustine and Aquinas, rejects this. The cross, again, is a case where the contingently permitted evil is turned to the highest good, but the perpetrators’ acts were not necessary in any strict sense to enable the good of redemption. Third, Leibniz’s metaphysics of substances and harmony sits uneasily with **primary and secondary causality** and the history of **covenant** where God acts in and through real causes and temporal means. The lesson to retain is not the best-world axiom but the maxim that God’s permission is neither arbitrary nor divorced from his wise ends. The corrective is to ground the ends not primarily in world-maximality but in the display of God’s justice and mercy in Christ as Scripture’s index of final value.

Plantinga’s Free Will Defense reshaped the modern debate by demolishing the logical problem of evil without offering a full theodicy. In God, Freedom, and Evil, he argues that it is possible that God, though omnipotent and omnibenevolent, could not actualize a world with moral good without permitting moral evil, given the counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. He introduces transworld depravity to show that for all we know, every significantly free creature would go wrong in any world in which it is significantly free. The key is possibility, not actuality. It follows that the set of propositions affirming God’s existence and the existence of evil is not logically inconsistent. Examiners will ask whether this defense presupposes libertarian freedom and thus conflicts with Reformed **compatibilist freedom**. There are two answers. First, as a strictly defensive maneuver aimed at the atheist’s burden, Plantinga’s argument is ad hominem in the classical sense: it uses a premise the objector is willing to grant, that significant freedom is valuable, to show inconsistency fails. A Reformed theist can deploy it without endorsing its anthropology. Second, for a positive theodicy, the Reformed theologian should indeed not take over libertarian assumptions but should explain responsibility under **compatibilist freedom**, where agents act according to their strongest reasons or desires without external coercion. Augustine and Edwards suffice to argue that responsibility rides with the moral psychology of love, not with a power of contrary choice abstracted from character. Under **compatibilist freedom**, God’s premotion and concurrence with secondary causes do not nullify agency. If an examiner objects that this returns us to the author-of-sin worry, the Thomist-Edwardsian answer is that God’s decree includes permission of sinful acts inasmuch as he wills to permit the defective act for higher ends, while the defect itself has no positive efficient cause in God. There remains a live internal debate about whether to pursue a Plantinga-style defense only or a full-fledged theodicy. I contend a bounded theodicy is warranted, but bounded by **analogical knowledge** and by Christology, resisting the temptation to itemize God’s reasons case by case.

William Rowe shifted the fulcrum from the logical to the evidential problem of evil. His famous example of a fawn dying painfully in a forest fire seems to instantiate gratuitous evil, evil that, as far as we can see, has no morally sufficient reason. Rowe’s inductive argument claims it is reasonable to infer that there are such evils, and therefore it is reasonable to withhold belief in a perfectly good God. Rowe’s friendly atheism concedes that believers need not be irrational, but he forces a choice: either show that such evils are unlikely or embrace a form of skeptical theism that explains our cognitive limits. The most fruitful answer combines both. First, the logic of no-see-um inferences is dubious in contexts where the domain of possible reasons is vastly beyond our ken, and the full narrative of history is not accessible. The resulting skeptical theism is not agnostic about God’s goodness but cautious about our grasp of God’s reason-structure. That caution is already implicit in **analogical knowledge** and in Aquinas’s insistence that we predicate goodness of God analogically, judging by effects, not by an inner view of the divine will. Second, Christians possess category-level reasons tied to Christ. The cross is a paradigmatic case where apparent gratuitousness masks the deepest prudence of God. Moreover, the history of **covenant** shows how God uses permitted evils for judgment and redemption across generations. This is not an attempt to map each instance of suffering to a specific reason, a perilous logic that often disfigures pastoral care. Rather, it is to say that within this kind of world—ordered toward the manifestation of justice and mercy in Christ—God has reasons sufficient to justify permission, though not reasons we can often specify. An examiner may push: does this amount to moral quietism? The answer is no. Skeptical theism concerns the epistemology of God’s reasons, not human obligations. The same doctrine that restricts our claims about God’s hidden ends intensifies our duties to relieve suffering because secondary causes are true causes under **providence**, and love of neighbor is the revealed will of God.

With these five figures in place, we can situate the layered debates. Internally, within the Augustinian–Reformed tradition, the order of the divine decrees has raised the question whether God’s will to permit the fall is in view of the fall or the fall is in view of a decree to glorify mercy and justice. Infralapsarians order election and reprobation with respect to an already permitted fall, while supralapsarians see the decree to glorify God by mercy and justice as logically prior. On either ordering, the critical safeguards are the same. First, the decree to permit sin must be framed under **primary and secondary causality** so that God wills to permit without being the efficient cause of the defect. Second, the decree is internally consistent with **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** because it is not a temporal decision but the eternal ordination of a history that includes God’s just and merciful acts toward sinners. Third, any speculative enthusiasm must be curbed by the cross: the end for which God ordains permission is not abstract maximality but the manifestation of his justice and mercy in the Son who as the second Adam bears the curse under **federal headship**. Another internal debate concerns whether to build an explicit theodicy or to rest content with a defense. Some argue that Job’s silence indicts rational theodicy. Yet Job ends with revelation of God’s wisdom, not with nihilism. A bounded theodicy is legitimate if it moves from what God has made known of his ways in Christ and creation to what may be reasonably inferred. The limits of **analogical knowledge** counsel reserve, not muteness.

Externally, several rival frameworks attempt to solve the problem by curtailing classical theism. Open theism proposes that God does not have exhaustive definite foreknowledge of free creaturely acts and is responsive within time, thereby avoiding the charge that God knowingly permits evil. Process theism goes further, denying omnipotence as classically conceived and making God the persuasive lure within an evolving cosmos. Hick’s soul-making program reinterprets the fall as mythology and treats evil as a necessary condition for moral growth in a universalist horizon. These strategies typically violate one or more anchor points: **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, and the exhaustive scope of **providence**. They also risk instrumentalizing suffering as necessary means to soul perfection, a claim Scripture never makes. By contrast, the Augustinian–Thomist–Reformed stance insists that the cross, not generic soul-making, is the axis of history. Sanctification is indeed soul-making, but it is the creaturely participation in Christ, not the justification of evil per se. The insistence on **divine justice** also blocks universalism by upholding **eschatological judgment**. A critic might claim that classical theism evacuates divine compassion. Yet **impassibility** denies passions, not affections; God is steadfastly disposed toward mercy and justice without being passively moved. Scripture credits God with pity and wrath analogically. The consistency of God’s covenantal love is secured, not jeopardized, by **impassibility**.

Contemporary challenges refine rather than overthrow the classical frame. Horrendous evils—torture, genocide, abuse—seem to overwhelm the plausibility of generic greater-good stories. Here Marilyn McCord Adams’s analysis is helpful, even if she is not one of our principal figures. Horrors threaten to engulf the meaning of a person’s life. The only adequate defeat of such evils is participation in goods incommensurate with the horror, namely union with God in Christ. My position incorporates this by arguing that the cross and resurrection are the only adequate horizon for serious theodicy. Nothing short of the beatific vision will suffice to render coherent how divine justice and mercy answer such evils. But this eschatological claim must not become an excuse for passivity. Precisely because God governs by **primary and secondary causality**, our action in the present is the appointed means of God’s care. Another pressing issue is divine hiddenness. The absence of felt presence in suffering might be read as evidence against a perfectly loving God. Yet the cross itself includes dereliction, and the Psalms authorize lament as covenant speech. Hiddenness is compatible with love when love aims at deeper goods than immediate consolation, including repentance, perseverance, and hope. Finally, evolutionary animal suffering is often pressed as a defeater for theodicy. On a Thomist account, animals lack moral status in the same sense as persons but are still part of the good of order. Predation and death among animals can be components of a dynamic creation ordered to displays of life’s plenitude and, in a fallen world, to judgments whose particular reasons evade us. Pragmatically, we should avoid the simplistic thought that animal suffering is always a consequence of human sin in a direct causal chain, even as Scripture frames creation’s groaning under Adamic headship.

At this point, the examiner will likely return to the worry that the Reformed synthesis collapses into determinism. The reply is to distinguish theological determinism from eliminativism about agency. The doctrine affirms that every event falls under God’s decree but denies that this renders secondary causes illusory or robot-like. God’s concurrence establishes rather than displaces the causal integrity of creatures. Agents act out of their character and reasons; their agency is not snuffed by the fact that God upholds and orders all. The author-of-sin objection is neutralized by the privation account and by the asymmetry between causing the act’s being and causing its deformity. If pressed on specific biblical texts that say God hardens hearts, the exposition is that God’s act of judicial hardening is a righteous retribution in which he withdraws restraining grace, permitting the sinner to follow his own bent. There is a moral asymmetry between God’s action and the creature’s action which suffices for responsibility.

Two adjacent loci finally integrate theodicy with the whole counsel of God. First, the atonement: on a penal substitutionary account, **divine justice** is not only distributive but rectifying. God satisfies justice in the Son, condemning sin in his flesh and thereby displaying righteousness. This is not a logic of sacrifice that requires sin but the wisdom that turns permitted evil into the scene of triumphant mercy without any complicity. Second, eschatology: **eschatological judgment** is indispensable to theodicy because divine justice is not fully manifest within history. Theodicy without final judgment risks trivializing evil. The resurrection guarantees that suffering is not ultimate, and judgment guarantees that injustice is not ignored.

The position defended is thus a Christologically bounded, Augustinian–Thomist account tuned to Reformed commitments. The doctrine of evil as **privation** underwrites the claim that God is not the author of sin; **primary and secondary causality** secures universal providence without competitive agency; **compatibilist freedom** grounds responsibility; Plantinga’s defense blocks the logical ax; Rowe’s evidential pressure is answered by a combination of skeptical theism and Scripture’s category-level reasons; Leibniz’s maximalism is pruned by the cross; and the pastoral horizon remains lament now and vindication then. Theodicy is not a calculus but a confession: that the Lord is righteous in all his ways and kind in all his works, and that his works include the permission of evils he will finally judge and redeem in Christ. Far from being a concession to philosophy, this confession secures the coherence of Christian worship amidst the wreckage of the world.
