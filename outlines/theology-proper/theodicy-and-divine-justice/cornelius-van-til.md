# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **theodicy** and **divine justice** through the lens of **presuppositional apologetics**, insisting that only the **triune God** of **Reformed theology** provides the necessary foundation for understanding the problem of evil. He argued that human attempts to judge God's justice autonomously are futile, as all reasoning must begin with the **self-attesting revelation** of Scripture, where God's justice and goodness are ultimately vindicated.

- "It is only upon the presupposition of the truth of the Christian theistic conception of God that the problem of evil can be rationally discussed." ("The Defense of the Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty and Absolute Justice**
    - God’s justice is inseparable from His absolute sovereignty over all creation.
    - Human standards of justice cannot be imposed upon God; He is the ultimate standard.
    - The existence of evil is comprehensible only within the context of God’s sovereign decree.
    - Divine justice is not subject to human critique but is revealed authoritatively in Scripture.
    - "God is not subject to a law above himself; he is himself the law." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Presuppositional Approach to Theodicy**
    - All reasoning about evil and justice must presuppose the truth of Christian theism.
    - Non-Christian worldviews cannot provide a coherent account of evil or justice.
    - Theodicy is not a neutral philosophical problem but a theological one rooted in revelation.
    - The problem of evil exposes the bankruptcy of autonomous human reasoning.
    - "The Christian answer to the problem of evil presupposes the truth of Christianity as a whole." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Self-Attesting Revelation**
    - Scripture is the ultimate authority for understanding divine justice and the reality of evil.
    - God’s revelation is self-authenticating and does not appeal to external standards.
    - Theodicy must be grounded in the redemptive-historical narrative of Scripture.
    - Human attempts to justify God apart from revelation are inherently flawed.
    - "The Bible is authoritative on everything of which it speaks, and it speaks of everything." (A Survey of Christian Epistemology)

4. **Antithesis Between Belief and Unbelief**
    - There is a fundamental antithesis between the Christian and non-Christian approaches to evil.
    - Only the regenerate mind, renewed by the Spirit, can rightly interpret God’s justice.
    - Unbelievers suppress the truth about God’s justice and distort the problem of evil.
    - Theodicy is ultimately a spiritual, not merely intellectual, issue.
    - "There is no common ground between the believer and the unbeliever except that which is provided by God himself." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Christ-Centered Resolution of Evil**
    - The ultimate answer to the problem of evil is found in the person and work of Christ.
    - The cross demonstrates both God’s justice and His mercy in dealing with sin and evil.
    - Redemption in Christ is the only context in which evil is finally and fully addressed.
    - Eschatological hope is essential to understanding divine justice and the defeat of evil.
    - "The Christian answer to evil is found in the redemptive work of Christ, which alone makes sense of history." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **theodicy** has profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics, emphasizing the necessity of grounding all discussions of **divine justice** in the self-revelation of the triune God. His insistence on the antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought has influenced generations of theologians and apologists. By rooting the problem of evil in the context of redemptive history and Christ’s work, Van Til provided a robust theological framework that continues to inform contemporary discussions on theodicy within the Reformed tradition.
