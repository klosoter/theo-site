# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield addressed the problem of **theodicy** and **divine justice** from a thoroughly **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing God's absolute sovereignty and the compatibility of divine justice with human responsibility. He maintained that the existence of evil ultimately serves to manifest God's **glory** and **holiness**, and that God's justice is supremely revealed and satisfied in the **atoning work of Christ**.

- "The problem of evil is, in fact, the problem of the relation of God to His world, and is soluble only as we recognize His absolute sovereignty and infinite wisdom." ("Predestination," in Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "Calvin and Calvinism"
- "Predestination" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Emotional Life of Our Lord"
- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Divine Sovereignty**
    - God ordains all that comes to pass, including the existence of evil, for His own wise purposes.
    - Divine sovereignty is not compromised by the presence of evil in the world.
    - Human events, including suffering, are encompassed within God's eternal decree.
    - God's will is never thwarted by creaturely actions or evil.
    "God rules over all things, and nothing comes to pass except as He has foreordained." ("Predestination")

2. **Justice and Holiness of God**
    - God's justice is intrinsic to His nature and cannot be separated from His holiness.
    - Divine justice demands the punishment of sin, which is ultimately satisfied in Christ.
    - Theodicy must uphold both the reality of evil and the unimpeachable righteousness of God.
    - God's justice is not arbitrary but is always consistent with His revealed character.
    "God is not only sovereign, but holy and just, and His justice is never set aside." ("The Plan of Salvation")

3. **Compatibility of Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - Human beings are morally responsible for their actions, even under divine sovereignty.
    - The presence of evil is not excused by God's decree; culpability remains with the creature.
    - Warfield affirms the mystery of concurrence between divine ordination and human freedom.
    - Theodicy must avoid both fatalism and Pelagianism.
    "The Scriptures teach both the sovereignty of God and the responsibility of man." ("Calvin and Calvinism")

4. **Redemptive Purpose of Evil**
    - Evil is permitted to display the full range of God's attributes, including mercy and justice.
    - The cross of Christ is the ultimate demonstration of God's justice and love in the face of evil.
    - Suffering and evil serve a pedagogical function in God's redemptive plan.
    - The final resolution of evil will be the vindication of God's justice and glory.
    "The existence of evil is overruled for the manifestation of the divine glory." ("The Plan of Salvation")

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Theodicy**
    - Warfield grounds his theodicy in the authority and sufficiency of **Scripture**.
    - He rejects speculative theodicies not rooted in biblical revelation.
    - The mystery of evil is acknowledged, but not explained away beyond what Scripture allows.
    - The justice of God is ultimately a matter of faith in His self-revelation.
    "We must be content to walk by faith, not by sight, in the presence of the mystery of evil." ("Biblical and Theological Studies")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield's approach to **theodicy** has profoundly shaped Reformed discussions of **divine justice**, especially in relation to the doctrines of **predestination** and **atonement**. His insistence on the harmony of God's sovereignty and justice continues to influence evangelical and confessional theology. Warfield's careful exegesis and theological rigor provide a model for addressing the problem of evil without compromising the core tenets of the Reformed faith. His legacy endures in both academic and ecclesial contexts as a standard for biblically grounded theodicy.
