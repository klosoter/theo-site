# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann addresses **theodicy** and **divine justice** by centering the **suffering of God** and the transformative power of **eschatological hope**. He rejects traditional rationalizations of evil, emphasizing instead God's solidarity with humanity in the **crucified Christ** and the ultimate redemption promised in the **Kingdom of God**.

- "God weeps with us so that we may one day laugh with him." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- God in Creation (1985)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Solidarity with Suffering**
    - God enters into human suffering through the person of **Christ**.
    - The cross reveals God's participation in the pain and injustice of the world.
    - **Divine justice** is expressed in God’s identification with victims.
    - Theodicy is reframed as God’s willingness to bear suffering rather than explain it away.
    - "Only a suffering God can help." (The Crucified God)

2. **Eschatological Resolution of Evil**
    - Evil and injustice are not justified but will be overcome in the promised future.
    - The resurrection points to a new creation where suffering and evil are abolished.
    - **Divine justice** is ultimately vindicated in the **eschaton**, not in present explanations.
    - Theodicy is hope in God’s future, not rational defense of the present.
    - "The ultimate answer to suffering is not an explanation but the resurrection." (Theology of Hope)

3. **Critique of Classical Theodicy**
    - Traditional theodicies often defend God at the expense of genuine compassion for sufferers.
    - Moltmann rejects attempts to rationalize or minimize the reality of evil.
    - Theology must take the suffering of the innocent seriously.
    - **Divine justice** cannot be separated from God’s empathetic engagement with the world.
    - "To justify God in the face of Auschwitz is to betray the victims." (The Crucified God)

4. **Trinitarian Suffering and Divine Pathos**
    - The suffering of Christ is shared within the **Trinity**, revealing a God who is affected by creation.
    - The Father suffers the loss of the Son, and the Spirit participates in the pain of the world.
    - This trinitarian dynamic grounds a theology of hope amid injustice.
    - **Divine justice** is relational, not merely juridical.
    - "The cross is the open wound of the Trinity." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

5. **Hope as the Basis for Theodicy**
    - **Christian hope** is the foundation for confronting evil and injustice.
    - Theodicy is not about explaining suffering but sustaining hope for transformation.
    - The church is called to embody hope by resisting evil and working for justice.
    - **Divine justice** is anticipated in the active hope for the coming **Kingdom**.
    - "Hope is nothing else than the expectation of those things which faith has believed to have been truly promised by God." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach to **theodicy** has profoundly shaped contemporary theology by centering the **crucified Christ** and the **eschatological promise** of justice. His insistence on God’s solidarity with suffering has influenced liberation, political, and feminist theologies. By rejecting rationalistic defenses of God and emphasizing hope, Moltmann has redirected theological reflection on evil toward active engagement and future-oriented faith. His work continues to challenge the church to embody hope and justice in a suffering world.
