# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **theodicy** and **divine justice** through the lens of his existential and ontological theology, emphasizing the **ambiguity of existence** and the **symbolic nature of God-language**. Rather than defending God’s justice in the face of evil through traditional rational arguments, Tillich reframed the problem, focusing on the **depth of being**, the **God above God**, and the existential estrangement at the heart of human experience.

- "The question of justice is the question of the meaning of existence itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially Volumes 1 and 2)
- The Courage to Be
- Love, Power, and Justice
- The Shaking of the Foundations
- Theology of Culture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as the Ground of Being**
    - God is not a being among beings but the **ground of all being**.
    - Divine justice is not an attribute but is rooted in the very structure of being itself.
    - Theodicy cannot be solved by appealing to God as a moral agent within the world.
    - Evil is understood as a distortion of being, not a substance.
    - "God does not exist. He is being-itself beyond essence and existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Symbolic Language and Divine Justice**
    - All language about God, including justice, is **symbolic** and points beyond itself.
    - Human concepts of justice are finite and cannot fully capture divine reality.
    - Theodicy fails when it treats God’s justice as analogous to human justice.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point but never exhaust it.
    - "Every religious statement is symbolic, and its truth cannot be judged by empirical or logical criteria." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Existential Estrangement and the Problem of Evil**
    - Evil arises from humanity’s **estrangement** from the ground of being.
    - The experience of injustice is rooted in the existential condition of separation.
    - Theodicy is reframed as the human struggle with meaninglessness and nonbeing.
    - Divine justice is experienced as the call to reunion and reconciliation.
    - "Sin is separation. Grace is reunion." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Ambiguity of Existence**
    - All finite existence is marked by **ambiguity**, including good and evil.
    - Theodicy must acknowledge the tragic structure of reality.
    - Divine justice is not always manifest in historical events or outcomes.
    - The ultimate answer to evil is found in the **new being** revealed in Christ.
    - "The ambiguity of life is not removed but accepted and transformed." (The Courage to Be)

5. **Justice as Love in Power**
    - Justice, love, and power are interrelated and must be held in tension.
    - Divine justice is the actualization of love through the structures of power.
    - Theodicy is not a speculative exercise but a call to participate in the healing of existence.
    - The fulfillment of justice is eschatological, not fully realized in history.
    - "Justice is the form in which and through which love performs its work." (Love, Power, and Justice)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **theodicy** and **divine justice** shifted the conversation from rational defense to existential interpretation, influencing both philosophical and theological discourse. His emphasis on **symbolic language** and the **ground of being** challenged classical theistic frameworks and opened new avenues for addressing the problem of evil. Tillich’s thought remains a touchstone for those seeking to grapple with suffering and injustice in a modern, secular context, while his existential reframing continues to provoke both critique and creative engagement within contemporary theology.
