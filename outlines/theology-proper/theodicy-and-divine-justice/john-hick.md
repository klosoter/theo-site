# John Hick (1922–2012)

John Hick advanced a distinctive approach to **theodicy** by developing the **soul-making** model, which reframes the problem of **evil** within the context of **divine justice** and human development. He argued that the existence of suffering is compatible with a loving God, as it serves as a necessary environment for **moral and spiritual growth** rather than being merely punitive or inexplicable.

- "The world is, according to this view, a place of 'soul-making' designed for the development of finite persons into children of God." ("Evil and the God of Love")

## Key Works

- Evil and the God of Love (1966)
- Philosophy of Religion (1970)
- Death and Eternal Life (1976)
- An Interpretation of Religion (1989)
- The Problem of Evil (editor, 1964)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Soul-Making Theodicy**
    - Evil and suffering are necessary for the development of **virtue** and **moral character**.
    - The world is structured as a "vale of soul-making" rather than a paradise.
    - Human freedom and the possibility of growth require genuine challenges and adversity.
    - God’s justice is ultimately oriented toward the fulfillment of human potential.
    - "Virtues are formed in the struggle against temptation and difficulty, not in the absence of them." (Evil and the God of Love)

2. **Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Final **divine justice** is realized not in this life but in the eschaton.
    - Suffering and evil are ultimately redeemed in the context of **universal salvation**.
    - Hick affirms the necessity of an afterlife for the completion of the soul-making process.
    - Theodicy is incomplete without reference to the future consummation of all things.
    - "The present life is not the end of the story; the fulfillment of God's purpose lies beyond." (Death and Eternal Life)

3. **Epistemic Distance**
    - God maintains a degree of hiddenness to preserve human freedom and responsibility.
    - The world is ambiguous, allowing for both faith and doubt.
    - This "epistemic distance" is essential for authentic moral decision-making.
    - Divine justice does not coerce belief but invites voluntary response.
    - "God is not overwhelmingly evident, so that men are free to choose or reject Him." (Evil and the God of Love)

4. **Critique of Augustinian Theodicy**
    - Rejects the notion that evil is solely the result of **original sin** or human rebellion.
    - Argues that the traditional **free will defense** is insufficient to explain natural evil.
    - Emphasizes the constructive role of suffering rather than its punitive aspect.
    - Sees the world as created with the potential for both good and evil as part of divine justice.
    - "The Augustinian tradition has not adequately accounted for the positive value of suffering." (Evil and the God of Love)

5. **Pluralistic Eschatology**
    - Divine justice is not limited to a single religious tradition.
    - Advocates for a **pluralistic** understanding of salvation and theodicy.
    - The soul-making process is accessible to all humanity, regardless of creed.
    - God's justice is ultimately inclusive and universal in scope.
    - "Salvation is not the exclusive preserve of any one faith, but the fulfillment of all persons in relation to the Real." (An Interpretation of Religion)

## Legacy and Impact

John Hick’s **soul-making theodicy** has become a central reference point in contemporary discussions of the problem of evil and divine justice. His emphasis on **eschatological fulfillment** and the constructive role of suffering challenged both classical and Reformed approaches to theodicy. Hick’s pluralistic vision broadened the scope of theological discourse, influencing debates on religious diversity and the universality of salvation. His work continues to provoke critical engagement and remains foundational in philosophical theology.
