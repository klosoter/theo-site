# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **theodicy** and **divine justice** with a strong emphasis on the mystery of **God’s sovereignty** and the reality of **human suffering**. He rejected speculative attempts to justify God’s ways, instead focusing on the biblical witness to **God’s righteousness** and the **problem of evil** as a lived tension within the context of **redemptive history**. Berkouwer’s theology insists that any discussion of divine justice must remain rooted in the **revelation of Christ** and the cross.

- "The problem of theodicy is not solved by abstract speculation, but by listening to the witness of Scripture concerning God’s justice and mercy." (The Providence of God)

## Key Works

- The Providence of God
- Sin
- Faith and Justification
- Studies in Dogmatics (series)
- The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theodicy as a Biblical, Not Philosophical, Task**
    - Rejects rationalistic or speculative theodicies that attempt to explain evil apart from revelation.
    - Emphasizes the narrative of **Scripture** as the proper context for addressing divine justice.
    - Maintains that the **problem of evil** is not fully resolved in this age.
    - Insists that the believer’s response is shaped by faith and hope in God’s promises.
    - "Theodicy is not a matter of human logic, but of faith seeking understanding in the light of God’s Word." (The Providence of God)

2. **God’s Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - Affirms the absolute **sovereignty of God** over all creation, including evil and suffering.
    - Holds that human responsibility is not negated by divine sovereignty.
    - Stresses the mystery of the relationship between God’s will and human actions.
    - Warns against deterministic or fatalistic interpretations of providence.
    - "We must not dissolve the tension between God’s sovereignty and human responsibility, but acknowledge it as a mystery revealed in Scripture." (The Providence of God)

3. **Divine Justice Revealed in Christ**
    - Centers the revelation of **divine justice** in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
    - Argues that the cross is the ultimate demonstration of God’s justice and mercy.
    - Sees the suffering of Christ as the key to understanding the problem of evil.
    - Emphasizes that God’s justice is not abstract but redemptive and personal.
    - "In Christ’s suffering and resurrection, we see the deepest answer to the question of God’s justice." (Faith and Justification)

4. **The Mystery of Evil**
    - Maintains that the origin and persistence of evil remain a profound mystery.
    - Rejects attempts to rationalize or minimize the reality of evil.
    - Affirms that Scripture confronts evil honestly without providing exhaustive explanations.
    - Encourages humility and trust in God amid unresolved questions.
    - "The Bible does not explain evil away, but confronts us with its reality and points us to God’s ultimate victory." (Sin)

5. **Hope in Eschatological Resolution**
    - Teaches that the full vindication of **divine justice** awaits the consummation of all things.
    - Emphasizes the eschatological hope of the new creation where evil and suffering are finally overcome.
    - Encourages perseverance and faith in the midst of present suffering.
    - Connects the believer’s hope to the promises of God’s final judgment and restoration.
    - "The answer to the problem of evil is ultimately eschatological, grounded in the hope of God’s coming kingdom." (The Providence of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s approach to **theodicy** and **divine justice** has shaped Reformed theology by insisting on the primacy of **biblical revelation** and the centrality of Christ. His refusal to offer speculative answers has encouraged a posture of humility and faith in the face of suffering. Berkouwer’s work continues to influence discussions on providence, evil, and the nature of God’s justice within both academic and pastoral contexts.
