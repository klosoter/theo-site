# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust account of **theodicy** and **divine justice** within the framework of **Reformed orthodoxy**. They affirm that God's **sovereignty**, **holiness**, and **wisdom** are perfectly compatible with the existence of evil, and that God's justice is ultimately vindicated in both **predestination** and the **final judgment**.

- "God, from all eternity, did, by the most wise and holy counsel of His own will, freely, and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass: yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures." (Westminster Confession of Faith 3.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 3, 5, 6, 33)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 12–19, 150–152)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 7–11, 82–84)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine
- Chad Van Dixhoorn, Confessing the Faith: A Reader’s Guide to the Westminster Confession of Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty and Providence**
    - God ordains all that comes to pass, including evil, yet remains unstained by sin.
    - Divine providence upholds, directs, and governs all creatures and actions.
    - Human freedom is preserved under God’s sovereign decree.
    - Evil is permitted for wise and holy ends, not as an end in itself.
    - "Yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures." (WCF 3.1)

2. **Original Sin and Human Responsibility**
    - Humanity fell in Adam, incurring guilt and corruption.
    - All sin proceeds from the free will of rational creatures.
    - God’s justice is not compromised by human sinfulness.
    - The Standards uphold both inherited guilt and personal accountability.
    - "The guilt of this sin was imputed; and the same death in sin and corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity." (WCF 6.3)

3. **Divine Justice in Salvation and Judgment**
    - God’s justice is displayed in both the salvation of the elect and the condemnation of the reprobate.
    - Christ’s atonement satisfies divine justice for the elect.
    - The final judgment will publicly vindicate God’s justice.
    - No injustice is done to the non-elect, who are left in their sin.
    - "The rest of mankind, God was pleased, according to the unsearchable counsel of His own will... to pass by, and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin." (WCF 3.7)

4. **Theodicy: God Not the Author of Sin**
    - God’s decree does not make Him the author of sin.
    - Secondary causes operate freely under God’s providence.
    - The permission of evil serves God’s wise and holy purposes.
    - God’s holiness and goodness remain uncompromised by evil’s existence.
    - "Nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures; nor is the liberty or contingency of second causes taken away, but rather established." (WCF 3.1)

5. **Purpose of Evil and Suffering**
    - Evil is used by God for His own glory and the good of the elect.
    - Suffering serves as a means of sanctification and displays God’s attributes.
    - The ultimate defeat of evil is assured in the final judgment.
    - God’s inscrutable wisdom governs all outcomes, even those involving evil.
    - "Yet so, as the sinfulness thereof proceedeth only from the creature, and not from God, who, being most holy and righteous, neither is nor can be the author or approver of sin." (WCF 5.4)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theodicy**, providing a systematic and biblically grounded account of **divine justice** that addresses the problem of evil without compromising God’s sovereignty or holiness. Their careful distinctions between God’s decree and human responsibility have influenced generations of theologians and confessional documents. The Standards remain a foundational reference for discussions of theodicy in the Reformed tradition, balancing the mystery of providence with the assurance of God’s ultimate justice.
