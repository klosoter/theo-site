# Bruce Ware (1953– )

Bruce Ware is a leading evangelical opponent of **open theism**, advocating for a robust affirmation of **divine omniscience**, **immutability**, and **sovereignty**. He maintains that while **divine condescension** is real and meaningful, it does not entail any limitation in God's exhaustive knowledge or control over the future, as open theism suggests.

- "God’s condescension is real, but it is the condescension of the omniscient, sovereign Lord, not the limitation of the finite or ignorant." ("God’s Lesser Glory," p. 140)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Omniscience is Exhaustive**
    - God knows all things, including all future contingencies and free actions.
    - Open theism’s denial of exhaustive foreknowledge undermines biblical teaching.
    - God’s knowledge is not limited by creaturely freedom.
    - Divine omniscience is essential to God’s perfection and trustworthiness.
    "God’s knowledge of the future is as complete and certain as his knowledge of the past and present." (God’s Lesser Glory, p. 80)

2. **Divine Immutability and Faithfulness**
    - God’s character and purposes do not change, even as He interacts dynamically with creation.
    - Open theism’s portrayal of a changing God is seen as biblically and theologically deficient.
    - Divine condescension is compatible with immutability; God’s promises and nature remain steadfast.
    - Immutability grounds the believer’s confidence in God’s faithfulness.
    "The God of the Bible is unchanging in his being, character, and purposes." (God’s Lesser Glory, p. 90)

3. **Authentic Divine Condescension**
    - God genuinely relates to and responds to His creatures.
    - Divine condescension is an expression of God’s sovereign freedom, not a limitation.
    - God’s self-revelation in history is accommodated to human understanding.
    - God’s relationality does not compromise His transcendence.
    "God’s condescension is the free act of the sovereign Creator, not the necessity of a limited deity." (God’s Lesser Glory, p. 140)

4. **Sovereignty and Providence**
    - God ordains and governs all things according to His wise and loving will.
    - Open theism’s emphasis on libertarian freedom diminishes God’s providential control.
    - Divine sovereignty is compatible with meaningful human responsibility.
    - Meticulous providence is central to biblical theism.
    "God’s sovereignty is not threatened by human freedom, but encompasses it." (Perspectives on the Doctrine of God, p. 217)

5. **Biblical Authority and Hermeneutics**
    - Scripture is the ultimate authority for understanding God’s nature and actions.
    - Anthropomorphic language about God must be interpreted in light of the whole counsel of Scripture.
    - Open theism’s reading of biblical texts is seen as selective and reductionistic.
    - A proper hermeneutic upholds both God’s transcendence and immanence.
    "We must interpret difficult passages in light of the clear and consistent teaching of Scripture as a whole." (God’s Lesser Glory, p. 55)

## Legacy and Impact

Bruce Ware’s critique of **open theism** has shaped contemporary evangelical debates on the doctrine of God, especially regarding **divine omniscience** and **sovereignty**. His defense of classical theism has reinforced confidence in the traditional attributes of God among Reformed and evangelical theologians. Ware’s work continues to serve as a key resource for those engaging questions of **divine condescension** and the boundaries of orthodox theism.
