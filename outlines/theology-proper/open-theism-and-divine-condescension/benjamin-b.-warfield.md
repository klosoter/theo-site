# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a staunch defender of **classical theism**, emphasizing the immutability, omniscience, and sovereignty of God. He firmly rejected **open theism**, viewing any suggestion of divine ignorance or change as incompatible with the **Reformed doctrine of God**. Warfield’s understanding of **divine condescension** was rooted in God’s voluntary accommodation to human limitations without compromising His essential attributes.

- "God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "The Biblical Doctrine of God" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Emotional Life of Our Lord"
- "Calvin and Calvinism"
- "The Idea of Systematic Theology"
- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Immutability and Omniscience**
    - God’s nature is unchanging and His knowledge is exhaustive, including all past, present, and future events.
    - Warfield rejected any suggestion that God learns or adapts in response to creation.
    - He saw **open theism** as a denial of the biblical and confessional doctrine of God.
    - Divine foreknowledge is comprehensive and certain.
    - "God’s knowledge is not conditioned by the creature, but is eternally perfect." (The Biblical Doctrine of God)

2. **Divine Condescension as Voluntary Accommodation**
    - God’s condescension is an act of grace, not a change in His being.
    - Warfield emphasized that God accommodates Himself to human understanding without surrendering His transcendence.
    - The language of Scripture about God’s emotions or repentance is anthropopathic, not literal.
    - Divine condescension serves the purpose of revelation, not limitation.
    - "God speaks to us in the language of men, but remains ever the infinite and unchangeable One." (The Emotional Life of Our Lord)

3. **Rejection of Open Theism’s Dynamic View of God**
    - Warfield critiqued any theology that posits God as temporally conditioned or ignorant of future contingencies.
    - He maintained that God’s sovereignty is absolute and not subject to human freedom.
    - Open theism undermines the assurance of God’s promises and providence.
    - The Reformed tradition insists on the Creator-creature distinction.
    - "To suppose that God waits on the creature for knowledge is to dethrone Him." (The Biblical Doctrine of God)

4. **Scriptural Authority and Theological Method**
    - Warfield insisted on the primacy of Scripture in defining the doctrine of God.
    - He argued that anthropomorphic language must be interpreted in light of the whole counsel of God.
    - Theological innovation that departs from confessional standards is to be rejected.
    - Systematic theology must safeguard the mystery and majesty of God.
    - "The Scriptures everywhere represent God as the absolute Sovereign, not as a fellow actor in the drama of history." (The Idea of Systematic Theology)

5. **Christological Implications of Divine Condescension**
    - Warfield saw the incarnation as the supreme example of divine condescension without change in the divine essence.
    - He emphasized the union of divine and human natures in Christ as a mystery, not a compromise of deity.
    - The emotional life of Jesus reveals true humanity, not limitation of divinity.
    - The incarnation is the pattern for understanding God’s dealings with humanity.
    - "In Christ, God comes near, but He does not cease to be God." (The Emotional Life of Our Lord)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of **classical theism** has profoundly shaped Reformed responses to open theism and modern revisions of the doctrine of God. His insistence on the immutability and omniscience of God remains a benchmark for confessional orthodoxy. Warfield’s nuanced account of **divine condescension** continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between God’s transcendence and immanence. His work stands as a bulwark against theological trends that diminish the majesty and sovereignty of the God of Scripture.
