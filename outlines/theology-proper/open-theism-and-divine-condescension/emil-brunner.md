# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the questions of **divine condescension** and the challenge of **open theism** through his emphasis on the personal, relational nature of God. He rejected both classical theistic **immutability** and modern attempts to make God wholly contingent, instead stressing that God's self-revelation in **Jesus Christ** is a genuine act of accommodation without surrendering divine sovereignty or knowledge.

- "God reveals Himself as the Living God, who meets man in freedom and in love, not as a fixed idea or a system." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Truth as Encounter
- Man in Revolt

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Personalism**
   - God is fundamentally personal and relational, not an abstract absolute.
   - Divine condescension is rooted in God’s desire for genuine relationship with humanity.
   - Revelation is always an encounter between persons, not mere transmission of information.
   - God’s freedom is expressed in His willingness to engage with human history.
   - "God is not a metaphysical principle but the living God who speaks and acts." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Revelation as Divine Accommodation**
   - God’s self-disclosure is always adapted to human limitations.
   - The incarnation is the supreme example of divine condescension.
   - Accommodation does not imply error or limitation in God, but a gracious act.
   - Revelation is both veiled and unveiled, preserving divine mystery.
   - "God’s revelation is always a condescension to our capacity." (Revelation and Reason)

3. **Rejection of Classical Immutability**
   - Brunner critiques the static concept of God inherited from Greek philosophy.
   - He affirms that God is unchanging in faithfulness, not in emotional or relational detachment.
   - Divine constancy is compatible with genuine responsiveness to creation.
   - God’s love is dynamic, not impassive.
   - "The God of the Bible is not the unmoved mover but the One who loves and acts." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

4. **Critique of Open Theism**
   - Brunner does not embrace open theism’s denial of exhaustive divine foreknowledge.
   - He maintains that God’s knowledge encompasses all time, while still allowing for real human freedom.
   - Divine condescension does not entail ignorance or risk on God’s part.
   - The future is open for humanity, but not for God.
   - "God’s knowledge is not limited by our freedom; it is the condition of it." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

5. **Christocentric Mediation of Divine-Human Relation**
   - Jesus Christ is the definitive act of divine condescension.
   - All knowledge of God is mediated through the person and work of Christ.
   - The incarnation reveals both God’s transcendence and immanence.
   - Christ is the bridge between divine sovereignty and human contingency.
   - "In Christ, God comes down to us, yet remains God." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of **divine condescension** influenced later discussions on the relational attributes of God and the limits of human knowledge of the divine. While he rejected the extremes of both classical theism and open theism, his emphasis on **personal encounter** and revelation as accommodation shaped neo-orthodox and post-barthian thought. Brunner’s Christocentric approach continues to inform contemporary debates on how God’s sovereignty and relationality coexist.
