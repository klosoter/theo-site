# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth rejected **open theism**’s revision of the classical doctrine of God, insisting instead on the **sovereign freedom** and **aseity** of God while affirming genuine **divine condescension** in revelation and covenant. For Barth, God’s self-limitation is not a surrender of omniscience or immutability, but a free act of **grace** in which God accommodates himself to humanity supremely in **Jesus Christ**.

- "God does not become another being, but He becomes another in His being, without ceasing to be Himself." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics II/1: The Doctrine of God
- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- The Humanity of God
- Karl Barth and the Problem of War and Other Essays on Barth (ed. John Howard Yoder)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Freedom and Sovereignty**
   - God is wholly free in his being and actions, not determined by creation.
   - Divine condescension is a sovereign act, not a necessity imposed by the world.
   - God’s knowledge and will are not limited by temporal events.
   - Barth resists any notion that God’s future is open or contingent upon creation.
   - "God is free to be God, and in His freedom He is Lord over His relationship to the world." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

2. **Revelation as Divine Condescension**
   - God reveals himself by graciously accommodating to human limitations.
   - This condescension is supremely realized in the incarnation of Jesus Christ.
   - Revelation does not compromise God’s transcendence or immutability.
   - God’s self-disclosure is always an act of grace, not necessity.
   - "God’s revelation is His self-unveiling, always His act, always His initiative." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **Rejection of Open Theism’s Mutability**
   - Barth maintains that God’s being and knowledge are not subject to change.
   - Divine faithfulness means God is consistent and reliable in all his ways.
   - God’s engagement with history is real but does not entail ontological change.
   - Open theism’s view of a changing God is seen as a denial of divine perfection.
   - "God remains Himself even in His turning towards the creature." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

4. **Christocentric Accommodation**
   - All divine condescension is centered in the person and work of Christ.
   - Jesus Christ is the definitive self-revelation and self-limitation of God.
   - The incarnation is the model for understanding God’s engagement with creation.
   - God’s humility is not weakness but the power of his love.
   - "In Jesus Christ, God Himself becomes the humble One." (The Humanity of God)

5. **Covenant and Divine Initiative**
   - God’s covenant with humanity is grounded in his free decision, not human action.
   - The relationship is established and maintained by God’s initiative alone.
   - Human response is real but always secondary to divine grace.
   - The covenant demonstrates God’s faithfulness without compromising his sovereignty.
   - "The history of the covenant is the history of God’s faithfulness to His promise." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s robust doctrine of **divine condescension** has shaped modern theology’s understanding of God’s relationship to the world, offering a powerful alternative to both classical theism and open theism. His insistence on God’s sovereign freedom and Christ-centered revelation continues to influence Reformed and ecumenical discussions of **divine immutability** and accommodation. Barth’s work remains a touchstone for debates on how God can be both transcendent and personally involved in history.
