# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine firmly rejected any notion akin to **open theism**, maintaining that God's **omniscience**, **immutability**, and **eternality** preclude any change or ignorance in the divine will or knowledge. For Augustine, **divine condescension**—God's accommodation to human understanding—never compromises the fullness of God's knowledge or sovereign providence, but rather reflects God's gracious communication within the limits of human language and experience.

- "For God does not change his plan, though he sometimes changes his commands, so that, while his plan remains unaltered, he may, by changing his commands, bring about the fulfillment of his plan through beings who are themselves subject to change." (City of God, 17.7)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Omniscience and Immutability**
    - God possesses exhaustive, unchanging knowledge of all things—past, present, and future.
    - Divine knowledge is not contingent upon creation or temporal events.
    - God’s will and purposes are eternally fixed and not subject to revision.
    - Any biblical language of God “changing” is anthropomorphic, not literal.
    - "For God’s knowledge, like his being, is altogether immutable." (City of God, 12.17)

2. **Divine Eternity and Timelessness**
    - God exists outside of time and is not subject to temporal succession.
    - All moments are equally present to God’s eternal perspective.
    - God’s actions in time are expressions of his eternal will, not responses to unforeseen events.
    - Divine condescension in Scripture is a matter of accommodating human temporality.
    - "In the eternal nothing passes away, but the whole is present." (Confessions, 11.13)

3. **Accommodation and Anthropomorphism**
    - Scriptural depictions of God “repenting” or “changing” are figurative.
    - God accommodates his revelation to human limitations for our understanding.
    - Divine condescension is pedagogical, not ontological—God does not actually change.
    - The language of Scripture is adapted to human modes of knowing.
    - "The Holy Scriptures speak in a manner suited to our capacity." (De Genesi ad Litteram, 6.18)

4. **Providence and Sovereignty**
    - God’s providence governs all things according to his unchangeable will.
    - Human freedom operates within the scope of divine foreknowledge and ordination.
    - There is no risk or uncertainty in God’s governance of creation.
    - Open theism’s view of divine risk is incompatible with Augustine’s doctrine of providence.
    - "Nothing, therefore, happens unless the Omnipotent wills it to happen." (Enchiridion, 95)

5. **Rejection of Open Theism**
    - God’s knowledge is not open or indeterminate; it is comprehensive and certain.
    - The future is as fixed and known to God as the past and present.
    - Any suggestion that God learns or adapts is a denial of divine perfection.
    - Augustine’s theology leaves no room for genuine contingency in God’s knowledge.
    - "God does not foreknow because events are destined to happen, but they happen because God foreknows them." (City of God, 5.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s robust defense of **divine immutability** and exhaustive foreknowledge decisively shaped the Western Christian tradition’s rejection of any proto-open theist ideas. His doctrine of **divine condescension** provided a framework for understanding anthropomorphic language in Scripture without compromising God’s perfection. Later theologians, especially in the Reformed tradition, drew heavily on Augustine’s insights to articulate the incompatibility of open theism with classical theism. His influence remains foundational in debates over God’s knowledge, providence, and the interpretation of biblical language about God.
