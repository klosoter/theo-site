# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate the classical Reformed doctrine of **God’s immutability**, **sovereignty**, and **omniscience**, decisively rejecting any form of **open theism**. These confessions insist that God’s **eternal decree** and knowledge are never contingent on human actions, and that divine accommodation is an act of grace, not a limitation of the divine nature.

- "God, after He had made all things, did not forsake them, or give them up to fortune or chance, but that He rules and governs them according to His holy will." (Belgic Confession, Art. 13)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 1, 13, 16
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 26–28
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. First Head of Doctrine, Articles 6–8, Rejection of Errors
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English edition)
- Lyle D. Bierma, "The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Immutability and Simplicity**
    - God is unchangeable in His being, attributes, and counsel.
    - Divine condescension does not imply any alteration in God’s essence.
    - God’s actions in history are expressions of His eternal will.
    - Anthropomorphic language is accommodated for human understanding, not descriptive of divine change.
    "We believe that this one only God is...unchangeable, infinite, incomprehensible..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 1)

2. **Absolute Divine Sovereignty**
    - God’s providence extends to all things, ruling them by His will.
    - Nothing happens by chance; all is subject to God’s decree.
    - Human freedom operates within the bounds of divine sovereignty.
    - Open theism’s denial of exhaustive foreknowledge is rejected.
    "He so governs them according to His holy will that nothing happens in this world without His appointment." (Belgic Confession, Art. 13)

3. **Exhaustive Divine Foreknowledge**
    - God knows all things, past, present, and future, perfectly and eternally.
    - God’s knowledge is not dependent on creation or human decisions.
    - The future is certain and known to God because He has decreed it.
    - Open theism’s limitation of God’s knowledge is incompatible with Reformed confessions.
    "Nothing can befall us by chance, but by the direction of our most gracious and heavenly Father." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 27)

4. **Divine Condescension as Gracious Accommodation**
    - God reveals Himself in ways suited to human capacity.
    - Accommodation is an act of grace, not a limitation of God’s being.
    - Scripture’s anthropomorphic language is pedagogical, not ontological.
    - Divine condescension serves the purpose of covenantal relationship, not mutual contingency.
    "For who can speak of God without being guilty of blasphemy, if he does not speak from the Word of God?" (Belgic Confession, Art. 12)

5. **Rejection of Open Theism’s Core Tenets**
    - The confessions explicitly reject any view that denies God’s exhaustive foreknowledge.
    - God’s will and decree are not conditioned by human actions.
    - The Canons of Dort anathematize those who claim God’s decree is based on foreseen faith or decisions.
    - Open theism’s dynamic view of God is contrary to the historic Reformed faith.
    "The Synod rejects the errors of those...who teach that God’s decree of election is based on foreseen faith, obedience, holiness, or any other good quality or disposition..." (Canons of Dort, I:Rejection of Errors, 1)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have provided the doctrinal backbone for Reformed churches worldwide, shaping their understanding of **divine sovereignty** and the Creator-creature distinction. Their robust affirmation of God’s **immutability** and exhaustive foreknowledge has served as a bulwark against the rise of open theism and other revisionist theologies. By articulating a careful doctrine of divine condescension, these confessions have enabled Reformed theology to affirm both God’s transcendence and His gracious nearness, without compromising the classical attributes of God. Their influence continues to define confessional boundaries in debates over the nature of God’s knowledge and interaction with creation.
