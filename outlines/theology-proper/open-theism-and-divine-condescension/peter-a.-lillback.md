# Peter Lillback (1951–)

Peter Lillback is a staunch critic of **open theism**, emphasizing the classical **Reformed doctrines** of **divine immutability**, **omniscience**, and **sovereignty**. He affirms **divine condescension** as a biblical and confessional way to understand God's interaction with creation, insisting that such condescension does not compromise God's essential attributes or knowledge. Lillback contends that open theism's redefinition of God's knowledge and relationality undermines the historic **doctrine of God**.

- "Open theism’s attempt to make God more relational by limiting his knowledge is a departure from the historic Reformed understanding of divine condescension." (The Binding of God)

## Key Works

- The Binding of God: Calvin’s Role in the Development of Covenant Theology
- “Theological Perspectives on Open Theism” (in various lectures and essays)
- “The Immutability of God and Covenant Theology” (Westminster Theological Journal)
- Contributions to Reformed Forum and Westminster Theological Seminary symposia on open theism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Condescension is Covenantally Framed**
    - God’s condescension is an act of **covenant grace**, not a change in his being.
    - The language of accommodation is necessary for human understanding of God’s actions.
    - Divine condescension preserves the Creator-creature distinction.
    - It is rooted in the biblical narrative and Reformed confessions.
    - "God’s covenantal condescension is not a limitation of his being but a gracious act for our benefit." (The Binding of God)

2. **Rejection of Open Theism’s Mutable God**
    - Open theism’s portrayal of God as changeable is incompatible with **divine immutability**.
    - Lillback maintains that God’s knowledge and will are not subject to temporal flux.
    - The historic Reformed tradition affirms God’s exhaustive foreknowledge.
    - Open theism undermines the assurance of God’s promises.
    - "To make God mutable is to deny the very foundation of covenant faithfulness." (The Binding of God)

3. **Scripture Interpreted by Analogy, Not Univocity**
    - Anthropomorphic language in Scripture is analogical, not literal.
    - Divine repentance or change is a manner of speaking, not an ontological reality.
    - The Reformed tradition uses the doctrine of accommodation to interpret difficult texts.
    - Open theism’s literalism leads to theological error.
    - "We must interpret God’s self-revelation analogically, lest we fall into creaturely projections." (The Binding of God)

4. **Covenant Theology as the Framework for Divine-Human Relations**
    - God relates to humanity through covenants, not by limiting his attributes.
    - The covenant structure explains God’s nearness without compromising his transcendence.
    - Divine condescension is covenantal, not ontological.
    - This framework preserves both God’s sovereignty and relationality.
    - "Covenant theology provides the biblical means for understanding God’s engagement with his people." (The Binding of God)

5. **Defense of Classical Theism**
    - Lillback upholds the classical attributes: **aseity**, **immutability**, **omniscience**, and **impassibility**.
    - He sees open theism as a significant departure from historic orthodoxy.
    - The Reformed confessions are clear on God’s unchanging nature.
    - Any revision of the doctrine of God must be measured by Scripture and confessional standards.
    - "The God of the Bible is not subject to the limitations of time or knowledge." (The Binding of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Peter Lillback has been a leading Reformed voice in defending **classical theism** against the innovations of open theism. His work on **divine condescension** has reinforced the importance of covenant theology as the proper context for understanding God’s relationship with creation. Lillback’s scholarship has shaped contemporary Reformed responses to open theism, ensuring that the historic doctrines of God’s immutability and omniscience remain central in theological discourse. His influence continues to be felt in both academic and ecclesiastical settings.
