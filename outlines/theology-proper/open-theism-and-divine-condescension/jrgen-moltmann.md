# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets **divine condescension** as God's self-limitation and openness to the world, challenging classical doctrines of **immutability** and **impassibility**. His theology of the **crucified God** and **eschatological hope** emphasizes a dynamic, relational God who genuinely suffers, responds, and is affected by human history.

- "God does not become a suffering God because he has to, but because he wills to love, and for that reason he suffers." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- God in Creation (1985)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- History and the Triune God (1991)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Suffering and Solidarity**
    - God freely chooses to suffer with and for humanity in Christ.
    - The cross reveals God's willingness to enter into the pain and abandonment of creation.
    - Divine suffering is not a limitation but the deepest expression of divine love.
    - This challenges traditional **impassibility** and affirms God's openness to the world.
    - "Only a suffering God can help." (The Crucified God)

2. **Dynamic Relationality of God**
    - God is not a static, unmoved mover, but dynamically involved in history.
    - The **Trinity** is understood as a community of mutual, loving relations.
    - God's being is constituted by openness and relationality, not self-enclosed perfection.
    - Divine condescension is seen as God's ongoing engagement with creation.
    - "God is in the world in such a way that he is affected by it and suffers its fate." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

3. **Eschatological Openness**
    - The future is genuinely open, shaped by God's promises and human response.
    - God’s actions are oriented toward the coming of the **Kingdom of God**.
    - Eschatology is not predetermined but participatory and hope-filled.
    - Divine condescension includes inviting creation into the unfolding of God's future.
    - "God’s future is open, not fixed, and it invites the participation of creation." (Theology of Hope)

4. **Critique of Classical Theism**
    - Moltmann rejects the notion of God as immutable, impassible, and unaffected by creation.
    - He critiques metaphysical frameworks that isolate God from history and suffering.
    - Divine condescension is incompatible with a God who cannot be moved or changed.
    - The God revealed in Christ is vulnerable, responsive, and self-giving.
    - "The God who cannot suffer cannot love either." (The Crucified God)

5. **Creation and Divine Self-Limitation (Kenosis)**
    - God creates space for the world through **kenosis**, a self-limiting act of love.
    - Divine condescension is expressed in God’s willingness to limit divine power for the sake of relationship.
    - Creation is not a necessity for God but a free act of love and openness.
    - God's self-limitation enables genuine creaturely freedom and history.
    - "God withdraws himself in order to make creation possible." (God in Creation)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has profoundly influenced contemporary discussions of **divine condescension**, suffering, and relationality, especially within the context of the **Trinity** and eschatology. His work paved the way for more open and dynamic models of God, resonating with but also critiquing aspects of open theism. Moltmann’s emphasis on the suffering and responsive God continues to shape debates on the nature of divine love, freedom, and the future of creation. His legacy endures in both academic theology and practical Christian witness to a God who is present, vulnerable, and engaged with the world.
