# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin firmly rejected **open theism**, upholding the classical **doctrine of God** with its emphasis on **immutability**, **omniscience**, and **impassibility**. He articulated a robust account of **divine condescension** that preserved God's transcendence while affirming His genuine covenantal engagement with creation, insisting that all biblical language about God’s change or accommodation is **anthropopathic** and analogical.

- "God is said to repent, not properly, as if any change could take place in God, but improperly and figuratively, because he does what a penitent man is accustomed to do." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, III.11.7)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Topics III–V)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on the Nature and Attributes of God (in Institutes)
- Willem van Asselt, "Reformed Scholasticism: Essays in Reassessment" (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Immutability and Simplicity**
   - God does not change in His being, will, or knowledge.
   - All biblical language of change in God is understood as **anthropopathism**.
   - Divine simplicity means God’s attributes are identical with His essence.
   - Any notion of God learning or adapting is categorically denied.
   - "Immutability is so essential to God that if it were taken away, he would cease to be God." (Institutes, III.11.2)

2. **Absolute Divine Omniscience**
   - God knows all things, past, present, and future, by a single, eternal act.
   - There is no increase or decrease in God’s knowledge.
   - God’s foreknowledge is not contingent upon the creature’s will.
   - Open theism’s denial of exhaustive foreknowledge is rejected as unbiblical.
   - "God knows future things with the same certainty as present and past things." (Institutes, III.12.5)

3. **Divine Condescension as Accommodation**
   - God accommodates Himself to human capacity in revelation.
   - Scriptural depictions of God’s emotions or changes are figurative.
   - Divine condescension does not imply any real change in God.
   - The covenant is a means by which God relates without compromising transcendence.
   - "God is said to descend, not by change of place, but by the manifestation of his presence." (Institutes, III.11.8)

4. **Rejection of Open Theism**
   - Open theism undermines the classical attributes of God.
   - It is inconsistent with the Reformed understanding of **providence** and **predestination**.
   - Turretin insists on the necessity of God’s exhaustive foreknowledge for the certainty of prophecy.
   - The denial of divine immutability is seen as a grave theological error.
   - "To ascribe ignorance or change to God is to destroy the foundation of all religion." (Institutes, III.12.6)

5. **Covenantal Relationship Without Ontological Change**
   - God’s covenantal dealings are real but do not entail ontological alteration in God.
   - The language of repentance or regret in God is explained as covenantal adaptation.
   - The Creator-creature distinction is rigorously maintained.
   - Divine condescension is an act of will, not of essence.
   - "God’s condescension is not a change in his nature, but a voluntary act of his will to relate to us." (Institutes, III.11.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s defense of **divine immutability** and his nuanced doctrine of **condescension** remain foundational for Reformed orthodoxy. His careful distinction between God’s essence and His covenantal actions provided a robust alternative to later developments like open theism. Turretin’s influence persists in confessional Reformed theology, shaping responses to contemporary challenges regarding the doctrine of God and the interpretation of anthropomorphic language in Scripture.
