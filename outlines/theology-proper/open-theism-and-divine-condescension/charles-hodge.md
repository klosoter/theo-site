# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge firmly rejected **open theism**, upholding the classical **doctrine of God** as immutable, omniscient, and sovereign. He affirmed that **divine condescension**—God’s accommodation to human understanding—never compromises God’s essential attributes or exhaustive foreknowledge, but rather demonstrates His gracious self-revelation within the bounds of **orthodox Reformed theology**.

- "God is infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons
- "Theology" entry in the Princeton Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Immutability and Omniscience**
    - God’s nature and knowledge are unchanging and exhaustive.
    - Divine foreknowledge encompasses all events, including free human actions.
    - Open theism’s denial of exhaustive foreknowledge is a fundamental error.
    - God’s immutability is essential to His perfection and trustworthiness.
    - "God is not only immutable in his being, but also in his knowledge and purposes." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Rejection of Open Theism**
    - Open theism undermines the biblical doctrine of God’s sovereignty.
    - It falsely posits that God learns or changes in response to creation.
    - Hodge insists that Scripture affirms God’s perfect knowledge of all things.
    - Any limitation of God’s knowledge is a denial of His deity.
    - "To suppose that God can be ignorant of anything, or that He can change, is to deny His very nature." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Divine Condescension as Accommodation**
    - God accommodates His revelation to human limitations without changing His essence.
    - Anthropomorphic language in Scripture is figurative, not literal.
    - Divine condescension is an act of grace, not a limitation of deity.
    - Accommodation does not entail ignorance or mutability in God.
    - "The language of Scripture is adapted to our capacities, but God remains ever the same." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Sovereignty and Providence**
    - God’s providence extends to all events, great and small.
    - Human freedom operates within the bounds of God’s sovereign decree.
    - Open theism’s view of providence is inconsistent with biblical teaching.
    - God’s governance is meticulous and purposeful, not reactive.
    - "All things are under His control, and nothing can happen without His will." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Scriptural Authority and Classical Theism**
    - The authority of Scripture undergirds all doctrines about God.
    - Classical theism is the consistent witness of both Scripture and the Reformed tradition.
    - Open theism is a modern innovation lacking exegetical and historical support.
    - Hodge appeals to the consensus of the church in affirming God’s attributes.
    - "The doctrine of God’s omniscience and immutability is the faith of the Church universal." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Charles Hodge’s robust defense of **classical theism** and his critique of any limitation on God’s knowledge or sovereignty have shaped generations of Reformed theologians. His articulation of **divine condescension** as gracious accommodation, rather than ontological change, remains influential in contemporary discussions. Hodge’s unwavering commitment to the authority of Scripture and the historic Reformed confessions continues to serve as a bulwark against theological innovations such as open theism.
