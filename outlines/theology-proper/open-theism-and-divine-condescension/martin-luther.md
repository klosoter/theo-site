# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **sovereignty of God** and the **immutability of the divine will**, rejecting any notion that God’s knowledge or purposes are contingent upon human actions as in **open theism**. For Luther, **divine condescension** is most clearly displayed in the incarnation and the cross, where God accommodates Himself to human weakness without compromising His **omniscience** or **aseity**. He insisted that God’s hidden majesty remains untouched even as He reveals Himself in humility for the sake of salvation.

- "God is present everywhere, but He does not wish that you grope for Him everywhere. Grope rather where the Word is, and there you will lay hold of Him in the right way." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 20)

## Key Works

- The Bondage of the Will (De Servo Arbitrio)
- Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- Lectures on Genesis
- Luther’s Small and Large Catechisms
- Sermons on the Incarnation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty and Immutability**
    - God’s will and knowledge are not subject to change or limitation by creation.
    - Human freedom is subordinate to the divine will; God’s purposes are never thwarted.
    - Luther rejects any suggestion that God learns or adapts in response to human actions.
    - The hiddenness of God (Deus absconditus) underscores His absolute freedom and transcendence.
    - "For God is not changed by things future, nor does He change His will on account of them." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Divine Condescension in the Incarnation**
    - God’s greatest act of condescension is the incarnation of Christ.
    - In Christ, God accommodates Himself to human weakness without diminishing His divinity.
    - The cross is the supreme revelation of God’s willingness to meet humanity in its need.
    - Divine condescension is not a limitation of God’s attributes but a gracious self-giving.
    - "He is present everywhere, but does not wish to be grasped except where He binds Himself to the Word." (Heidelberg Disputation)

3. **Rejection of Open Theism**
    - Luther affirms God’s exhaustive foreknowledge and denies any openness or uncertainty in God.
    - The future is as fixed and known to God as the past and present.
    - Human ignorance of God’s will does not imply ignorance or change in God Himself.
    - Open theism’s view of a risk-taking God is incompatible with Luther’s doctrine of divine majesty.
    - "God foreknows nothing contingently, but He foresees, purposes and does all things according to His immutable, eternal and infallible will." (The Bondage of the Will)

4. **Theology of the Cross and Divine Self-Revelation**
    - God reveals Himself most clearly in suffering and humility, not in human expectations of power.
    - The cross is the paradoxical locus of divine glory and condescension.
    - Human reason cannot grasp God’s ways apart from revelation.
    - Divine self-revelation is always an act of grace, not necessity.
    - "He who does not know Christ does not know God hidden in suffering." (Heidelberg Disputation)

5. **Distinction Between Deus Absconditus and Deus Revelatus**
    - God as He is in Himself (Deus absconditus) remains incomprehensible and sovereign.
    - God as revealed (Deus revelatus) is accessible through Word and sacrament.
    - Divine condescension is the means by which the hidden God becomes known to faith.
    - This distinction guards against speculation about God’s inner life or changeability.
    - "We must keep the distinction between the hidden God and the revealed God." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of **divine sovereignty** and his theology of the cross decisively shaped Protestant understandings of God’s relationship to creation. His rejection of any form of **open theism** set a trajectory for later Reformed and Lutheran thought, emphasizing the unchangeable character of God’s will and knowledge. Luther’s articulation of **divine condescension** through the incarnation and the cross remains foundational for discussions of God’s self-revelation and accommodation. His distinction between the hidden and revealed God continues to inform debates on the limits of human knowledge of the divine.
