# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in twentieth-century **Reformed theology**, rejected **open theism** as incompatible with the classical doctrine of **God’s immutability, omniscience, and sovereignty**. He affirmed that **divine condescension**—God’s gracious accommodation to human understanding and history—never compromises God’s eternal nature or exhaustive foreknowledge. Murray’s approach upholds the Creator-creature distinction while emphasizing the reality of God’s personal engagement with His people.

- "God’s condescension is not to be construed as a diminution of his glory or a limitation of his sovereignty." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Principles of Conduct (1957)
- The Epistle to the Romans (1959–1965)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology (1977)
- "The Sovereignty of God" in The Presbyterian Guardian (1936)
- Redemption Accomplished and Applied (1955)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Immutability and Omniscience**
   - God’s knowledge is exhaustive and not subject to temporal change.
   - Divine immutability ensures that God’s purposes and promises are unalterable.
   - Open theism’s denial of exhaustive foreknowledge is incompatible with biblical teaching.
   - God’s knowledge encompasses all contingencies and actualities.
   - "God’s knowledge is not contingent upon the unfolding of history but is eternally perfect." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
   - God’s being and knowledge are qualitatively distinct from those of creatures.
   - Divine condescension does not erase the ontological gap between God and humanity.
   - Accommodation is an act of grace, not necessity or limitation.
   - Open theism blurs the distinction by attributing creaturely limitations to God.
   - "The infinite distance between God and man is never compromised by God’s gracious dealings." (Principles of Conduct)

3. **Sovereignty and Providence**
   - God sovereignly ordains all that comes to pass, including human decisions.
   - Divine providence is meticulous, not general or reactive.
   - Open theism undermines confidence in God’s sovereign governance.
   - God’s condescension is the means by which He executes His sovereign will in history.
   - "The sovereignty of God is the foundation of all our confidence and hope." (The Presbyterian Guardian, 1936)

4. **Covenantal Condescension**
   - God enters into covenant with humanity as a voluntary act of grace.
   - Divine condescension is expressed supremely in the incarnation and redemptive history.
   - The covenant framework preserves both God’s transcendence and immanence.
   - God’s self-revelation is always consistent with His eternal attributes.
   - "The covenant is the bond in blood sovereignly administered by God in his condescension." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Scriptural Authority and Anthropomorphism**
   - Scripture uses anthropomorphic language to communicate divine realities.
   - Such language does not imply literal change or ignorance in God.
   - Open theism’s literalism misreads the intent of biblical accommodation.
   - The authority of Scripture requires interpreting anthropomorphisms in light of God’s revealed attributes.
   - "Anthropomorphic expressions must be interpreted in the light of the whole counsel of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust defense of **divine immutability** and the Creator-creature distinction has shaped contemporary Reformed responses to open theism. His articulation of **covenantal condescension** remains influential in discussions of God’s relationship to history and revelation. By grounding divine accommodation in the unchanging character of God, Murray provided a framework that safeguards both God’s transcendence and His personal engagement with creation. His legacy endures in the ongoing defense of classical theism within Reformed orthodoxy.
