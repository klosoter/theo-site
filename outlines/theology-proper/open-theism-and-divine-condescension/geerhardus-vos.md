# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos firmly rejected **open theism**, upholding the classical **immutability**, **omniscience**, and **aseity** of God. For Vos, **divine condescension** is not a limitation of God's being or knowledge, but a sovereign act whereby the infinite God accommodates Himself to finite creatures in **revelation** and **covenant** without surrendering His essential attributes.

- "God’s condescension is not a surrender of His nature, but a gracious adaptation to the limitations of the creature." ("Biblical Theology")

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics (especially Vol. 1: Theology Proper)
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (essay)
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline" (article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Immutability and Omniscience**
    - God’s knowledge is exhaustive, eternal, and unchanging.
    - Divine condescension does not imply any change or ignorance in God.
    - Vos rejects any notion that God learns or is surprised by creaturely actions.
    - The Creator-creature distinction is fundamental to all theology.
    - "God’s knowledge is not subject to the limitations of time or creaturely development." (Reformed Dogmatics)

2. **Revelation as Divine Accommodation**
    - God reveals Himself in ways suited to human understanding.
    - Accommodation is an act of grace, not a limitation of God’s being.
    - The language of Scripture is anthropomorphic, not ontologically descriptive of God.
    - Revelation is always a sovereign initiative, not a response to human unpredictability.
    - "Revelation is God’s act of making Himself known in forms accessible to the finite mind." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Covenant as Structured Condescension**
    - The covenant is the primary means of God’s relational condescension.
    - God voluntarily binds Himself to promises without compromising His sovereignty.
    - The covenant does not entail mutual risk or uncertainty for God.
    - Vos sees the covenant as a framework for understanding all of redemptive history.
    - "The covenant is the form in which God’s condescension to man is most clearly expressed." ("Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology")

4. **Rejection of Open Theism**
    - Open theism undermines the classical attributes of God.
    - Vos insists that God’s foreknowledge and decree are comprehensive and certain.
    - Any suggestion that God is temporally conditioned is incompatible with biblical revelation.
    - Divine responsiveness is covenantal, not ontological.
    - "To ascribe ignorance or change to God is to deny His deity." (Reformed Dogmatics)

5. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God’s being and knowledge are qualitatively distinct from creation.
    - Divine condescension bridges the gap without erasing the distinction.
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal.
    - The infinite cannot be contained or limited by the finite.
    - "The distinction between Creator and creature is the foundation of all true theology." (Reformed Dogmatics)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust defense of **divine immutability** and his nuanced doctrine of **condescension** have shaped Reformed responses to open theism. His emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the covenantal structure of revelation remains foundational in contemporary Reformed theology. Vos’s work continues to serve as a bulwark against modern attempts to revise the doctrine of God in ways that compromise classical theism.
