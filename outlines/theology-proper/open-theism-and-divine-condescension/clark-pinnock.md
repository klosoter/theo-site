# Clark Pinnock (1937–2010)

Clark Pinnock was a leading advocate of **open theism**, emphasizing a dynamic relationship between God and creation marked by genuine **divine condescension**. He argued that God’s **omniscience** includes knowledge of all possibilities, but the future is partly open, allowing for authentic human freedom and responsive divine action.

- "God is open to the world, responsive, and willing to be affected by what we do." ("Most Moved Mover")

## Key Works

- Most Moved Mover: A Theology of God’s Openness
- The Openness of God (co-authored with Richard Rice, John Sanders, et al.)
- The Grace of God, the Will of Man: A Case for Arminianism (editor)
- Flame of Love: A Theology of the Holy Spirit
- "Systematic Theology" entry in The Openness of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Knowledge is Dynamic**
    - God knows all that can be known, including the past and present exhaustively.
    - The future is partly comprised of possibilities, not certainties.
    - God’s **omniscience** is not compromised by the openness of the future.
    - This view preserves both divine sovereignty and human freedom.
    - "God knows everything that can be known, but the future is not entirely settled." (Most Moved Mover)

2. **Divine Condescension is Genuine**
    - God truly enters into relationship with creation, not merely appearing to do so.
    - God’s actions and emotions are responsive to human choices.
    - The **incarnation** is the supreme example of divine condescension.
    - God’s willingness to be affected by creation is a mark of divine love, not weakness.
    - "God is not aloof or impassible but deeply involved with his creatures." (Most Moved Mover)

3. **Human Freedom is Libertarian**
    - Humans possess genuine, not merely apparent, freedom to choose.
    - God’s providence works in partnership with human decisions.
    - The future is not exhaustively predetermined by God.
    - This freedom is essential for authentic love and relationship.
    - "Love must be freely chosen, and so God gives us room to say yes or no." (The Openness of God)

4. **Prayer and Petition are Effective**
    - Prayer can truly influence God’s actions in history.
    - God’s openness means he listens and responds to human requests.
    - The biblical record of God changing his mind is taken at face value.
    - Divine condescension ensures that prayer is meaningful, not illusory.
    - "God invites us to participate with him in shaping the future." (Most Moved Mover)

5. **Biblical Narrative Guides Doctrine**
    - The **biblical witness** portrays God as relational, responsive, and open.
    - Theological formulations must be accountable to the scriptural narrative.
    - Classical theism’s emphasis on immutability and impassibility is seen as unbiblical.
    - Pinnock prioritizes the God revealed in **salvation history** over philosophical abstractions.
    - "We must let the biblical story of God’s interaction with people shape our theology." (The Openness of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Clark Pinnock’s advocacy for **open theism** has significantly shaped contemporary debates about the nature of God’s knowledge, providence, and relationality. His emphasis on **divine condescension** challenged classical theism and inspired a generation of theologians to reconsider the biblical portrayal of God’s involvement in history. While controversial, his work has broadened the conversation on **divine sovereignty** and human freedom, leaving a lasting mark on evangelical and Arminian theology.
