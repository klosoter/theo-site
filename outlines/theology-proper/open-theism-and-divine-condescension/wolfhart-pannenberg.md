# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg engaged the questions of **divine condescension** and the openness of God through his distinctive emphasis on **God’s self-revelation in history** and the dynamic nature of **God’s relationship to creation**. While not an advocate of **open theism** per se, Pannenberg’s theology explores how **God’s eternity** and **omniscience** interact with genuine **historical contingency** and the unfolding of human freedom, insisting that God’s self-giving does not compromise divine sovereignty but rather fulfills it in the eschatological consummation.

- "God’s eternity is not a timeless being but the power to hold all times together and to be present in every moment of time." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1–3
- Revelation as History (with R. Rendtorff, U. Wilckens, T. Rendtorff)
- Jesus—God and Man
- Theology and the Kingdom of God
- Metaphysics and the Idea of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Historical Event**
   - God’s self-disclosure occurs within the unfolding of historical events.
   - Revelation is not static but is progressively clarified through history.
   - The resurrection of Christ is the central event revealing God’s character and intentions.
   - Divine condescension is actualized in God’s willingness to be known in temporal processes.
   - "The revelation of God is not a timeless truth but an event in history." (Revelation as History)

2. **Eschatological Fulfillment of Divine Knowledge**
   - God’s knowledge encompasses all possibilities and actualities, culminating in the eschaton.
   - The future is genuinely open from the human perspective, but fully present to God.
   - Divine omniscience is compatible with the real contingency of historical events.
   - God’s self-realization in history reaches its fullness at the end of time.
   - "God knows the future as the completion of his plan, not as a fixed sequence of events." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Dynamic Divine Immanence**
   - God is not distant but actively involved in the world’s history.
   - Divine action respects creaturely freedom and the openness of history.
   - God’s immanence is expressed through the Spirit’s ongoing work in creation.
   - Condescension is not a limitation but a mode of God’s relational presence.
   - "God’s presence in the world is the power of the future breaking into the present." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Trinitarian Relationality**
   - God’s being is constituted by relationality within the Trinity.
   - Divine condescension is rooted in the eternal self-giving of the Son and the Spirit.
   - The openness of God is grounded in the mutual love and freedom of the triune persons.
   - The incarnation exemplifies God’s willingness to enter into human limitation.
   - "The trinitarian God is not closed in upon himself but open to the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Critique of Classical Theism’s Timelessness**
   - Pannenberg rejects the notion of God as wholly timeless and impassible.
   - Divine eternity is reinterpreted as God’s lordship over time, not detachment from it.
   - God’s engagement with history is essential to God’s identity.
   - The classical doctrine of immutability is revised to allow for genuine interaction with creation.
   - "God’s eternity is not the negation of time but its fulfillment." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s theology has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **divine temporality**, **eschatology**, and the relationship between **God’s sovereignty** and historical openness. His nuanced account of **divine condescension** offers a robust alternative to both classical theism and open theism, emphasizing God’s self-involvement in history without denying divine transcendence. Pannenberg’s work continues to influence debates on how God’s knowledge and action relate to the genuine contingency of the world, providing a mediating position that remains vital in systematic theology.
