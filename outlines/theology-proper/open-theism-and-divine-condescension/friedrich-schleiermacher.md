# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the understanding of **divine condescension** by emphasizing God's relation to human consciousness and experience, rather than classical metaphysical categories. While he did not advocate **open theism** in its modern sense, his theology of **God’s immanence** and the **feeling of absolute dependence** paved the way for later challenges to traditional doctrines of **divine immutability** and **omniscience**. Schleiermacher’s approach foregrounds the dynamic, relational aspects of God’s engagement with creation.

- "God is not a being outside the world, but the world is in God." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Immanence and Relationality**
   - God is present within all aspects of creation and human experience.
   - Divine action is understood through the ongoing relationship between God and the world.
   - Rejects a strict separation between the transcendent and immanent aspects of God.
   - Emphasizes the immediacy of God’s presence in the **feeling of absolute dependence**.
   - "Every moment of our existence is a relation to the Infinite." (On Religion)

2. **Redefinition of Divine Attributes**
   - Attributes like **immutability** and **omniscience** are interpreted through the lens of God’s relation to the world.
   - Divine attributes are not static metaphysical properties but are understood dynamically.
   - God’s knowledge and will are expressed in and through the unfolding of history.
   - The classical doctrine of **impassibility** is reinterpreted to allow for genuine divine responsiveness.
   - "God’s attributes are not abstract qualities, but expressions of His relation to us." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Divine Condescension as Accommodation**
   - God’s self-revelation is always accommodated to human finitude and historical context.
   - Revelation is not propositional but experiential, mediated through the community of faith.
   - Divine condescension is seen in God’s willingness to be known within the limits of human consciousness.
   - The incarnation is the supreme example of God’s accommodating presence.
   - "The Redeemer is the one in whom the divine essence is most perfectly revealed in human form." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
   - Theology begins with the **feeling of absolute dependence** rather than abstract speculation.
   - Religious experience is the foundation for understanding God’s condescension.
   - Doctrine is a reflection on the communal experience of God, not a set of immutable truths.
   - The church is the context in which divine-human interaction is most fully realized.
   - "Religion is neither a knowing nor a doing, but a feeling." (On Religion)

5. **Historical Development of Doctrine**
   - Doctrines develop as the church reflects on its experience of God’s presence.
   - Theological formulations are historically conditioned and subject to revision.
   - Divine condescension is evident in God’s ongoing engagement with the church’s history.
   - Openness to doctrinal development anticipates later themes in **open theism**.
   - "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s emphasis on **divine immanence** and the historical development of doctrine profoundly influenced modern theology, laying groundwork for later discussions of **divine condescension** and even aspects of **open theism**. His reinterpretation of classical attributes challenged traditional views of God’s relationship to time and history. While not an open theist, Schleiermacher’s legacy is seen in the move toward a more relational and dynamic understanding of God in contemporary theology. His thought continues to shape debates on the nature of **revelation**, **religious experience**, and the limits of doctrinal formulation.
