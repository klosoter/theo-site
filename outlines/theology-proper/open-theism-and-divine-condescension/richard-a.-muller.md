# Richard Muller (b. 1948)

Richard Muller is a leading historian of **Reformed orthodoxy** who has critically analyzed the development of doctrines such as **divine condescension** and the classical attributes of God. Muller rejects **open theism** as a significant departure from the historic **Reformed doctrine of God**, emphasizing the careful distinctions made by early Reformed theologians regarding God's **immutability**, **omniscience**, and the nature of **accommodation** in revelation.

- "The Reformed orthodox did not understand divine accommodation as a limitation of God’s knowledge or power, but as a gracious condescension to human finitude." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: The Divine Essence and Attributes
- Divine Will and Human Choice: Freedom, Contingency, and Necessity in Early Modern Reformed Thought
- After Calvin: Studies in the Development of a Theological Tradition
- "Divine Accommodation and Anthropomorphism in the Theology of John Calvin" (in Calvin Theological Journal)
- The Unaccommodated Calvin: Studies in the Foundation of a Theological Tradition

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Classical Doctrine of Divine Immutability**
    - God’s nature and will do not change in response to creation.
    - **Immutability** is upheld alongside genuine divine involvement in history.
    - Reformed orthodoxy distinguishes between God’s eternal decree and temporal execution.
    - Divine condescension is not a change in God but a manner of relating to creatures.
    - "God’s condescension is not a change in his being but a mode of revelation suited to the finite." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

2. **Rejection of Open Theism**
    - Open theism is seen as incompatible with historic Reformed confessions.
    - The tradition affirms God’s exhaustive **foreknowledge** and sovereignty.
    - Open theism’s view of divine ignorance or risk is foreign to Reformed sources.
    - Muller argues that open theism misunderstands the intent of **accommodation**.
    - "The notion that God learns or is surprised by events is alien to the Reformed orthodox tradition." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

3. **Doctrine of Divine Accommodation**
    - Accommodation is God’s gracious adaptation of revelation to human limitations.
    - It does not imply ontological change or limitation in God.
    - Anthropomorphic language is a tool for human understanding, not a literal description.
    - The concept is rooted in **Scripture** and developed by Calvin and his successors.
    - "Accommodation is a hermeneutical principle, not a metaphysical assertion about God." (The Unaccommodated Calvin)

4. **Distinction Between Archetypal and Ectypal Theology**
    - God’s self-knowledge (archetypal) is distinct from human knowledge of God (ectypal).
    - Human theology is always analogical and accommodated.
    - This distinction safeguards divine transcendence while allowing true knowledge.
    - The Reformed tradition maintains this to avoid both rationalism and agnosticism.
    - "The distinction between archetypal and ectypal theology is fundamental to Reformed orthodoxy’s doctrine of God." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Divine Attributes**
    - The attributes of God are derived from careful exegesis and theological reflection.
    - **Immutability**, **omniscience**, and **omnipotence** are affirmed as biblical.
    - The Reformed orthodox read anthropomorphic texts in light of clearer passages.
    - Scripture’s accommodation does not undermine its truthfulness about God.
    - "The Reformed orthodox insisted that Scripture’s accommodated language does not compromise the reality of God’s attributes." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Muller’s scholarship has decisively shaped the understanding of **Reformed scholasticism** and its doctrine of God, especially in debates over **open theism** and divine condescension. His work has clarified the historical and theological roots of **accommodation** and challenged contemporary revisions that depart from classical theism. By recovering the nuanced distinctions of early modern Reformed theology, Muller has provided a robust framework for engaging modern challenges to the doctrine of God. His influence is evident in both academic and ecclesial discussions of divine attributes and revelation.
