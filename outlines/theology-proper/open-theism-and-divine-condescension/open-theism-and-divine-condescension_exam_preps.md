### ESSAY
To address open theism and divine condescension under oral examination, one must first locate the conceptual nerve of the discussion: whether the God of Scripture, who covenants, relents, grieves, and responds, is compatible with the God of **classical theism**, who is simple, immutable, eternal, impassible, and omniscient with exhaustive definite foreknowledge. Open theism claims that to take divine condescension seriously one must revise classical attributes and allow that the future, in at least some respects, is ontologically open even for God. A Reformed classical account insists that this is a false dilemma: that the same triune Lord who is **actu purus** and perfect in **aseity** freely wills to relate, condescend, and enter historical covenant without any change in being or knowledge.

The debate cannot be understood without beginning from Augustine, who is decisive both for the classical account of God and for the exegesis of anthropomorphic and anthropopathic language in Scripture. In works such as Confessions and De Trinitate, Augustine articulates a strong doctrine of **divine immutability** and **eternity**. God does not move through time as creatures do; rather, all times are present to him in a single, simple act of knowledge and will. Augustine’s hermeneutic is crucial: he insists that when Scripture speaks of God repenting, becoming angry, or changing his mind, the change is in the creature and in the economy, not in God’s eternal will. The same unchanging will of God is expressed differently as creatures move from unbelief to faith, from obedience to disobedience. Augustine thus establishes a pattern of reading condescending language analogically, not univocally, rooted in **analogical knowledge** of God. God truly reveals himself in creaturely terms, yet these terms signify him in a way proportioned to our capacity, not by giving us immediate access to the mode of his infinite being.

Examiner pressure will quickly focus here: Does this Augustinian account evacuate the reality of divine relationality? Are the biblical depictions of God’s grief in Genesis 6 or his relenting in Exodus 32 merely convenient fictions? The Augustinian answer, which the Reformed tradition will later elaborate, is that God’s relationality is real because his will to relate is eternal, free, and perfectly efficacious. God’s love is not enhanced by creation, but creation is the temporal effect of his eternal love. The fact that he does not change in his being or knowledge does not mean his relations to mutable creatures are unreal. Rather, those changing relations are the very outworking of his immutable decree in the theater of history.

John Calvin, in the sixteenth century, takes Augustine’s metaphysical and hermeneutical insights and forges them into a covenantal framework that is central to the doctrine of **divine condescension**. Calvin’s Institutes, especially in the early books, articulate God’s **incomprehensibility** and **simplicity** in a robust Augustinian way, yet Calvin is preeminently concerned with how God makes himself known in Christ and in the covenant. His doctrine of **accommodation** is an explicit reflection on divine condescension: God “lisps” to us as nurses do to children, adopting human modes of speech and action suited to our finite condition. For Calvin, this is not a denial of reality but its condition. God’s speech acts in Scripture are suited to our capacity; when he says he “repents,” this is a true revelation of how God stands toward a changed situation in the covenant, but the underlying divine willing is simple and eternal.

Calvin solidifies several conceptual anchors that undercut the open theist critique before it arises. First, he unites **comprehensive providence** with genuine human responsibility. God’s eternal decree encompasses all things, yet humans act voluntarily and culpably. This is secured not by libertarian freedom in the creature, but by the Creator–creature distinction and the asymmetry between first causes and secondary causes. Second, Calvin’s insistence on the unity of the **mediatorial work of Christ** and the decree means that the deepest form of condescension is not God’s epistemic adjustment to creaturely unpredictability, but the Son’s assumption of human nature and willing exposure to historical suffering. The Reformed tradition following Calvin will consistently argue that to speak of divine “risk” in the open theist sense relativizes the absolute sovereignty of the cross and the certainty of redemption grounded in an immutable decree.

The emergence of open theism as a self-conscious alternative to classical theism in late twentieth-century evangelicalism is unintelligible apart from the destabilizing effects of modern relational and kenotic theologies, of which Jürgen Moltmann is a key representative. Moltmann is not an open theist, but his work on the suffering of God and the “crucified God” significantly shifts the field. In The Crucified God and The Trinity and the Kingdom of God, Moltmann rejects classical **impassibility** as incompatible with God’s love and solidarity with the suffering. He reconceives the trinitarian life itself as historically affected by the cross. The Father and the Son, as he reads the passion, are mutually involved in a history of pain that leaves its mark on God’s own being. This is a far more radical move than traditional accounts of the incarnation’s historical significance; it implies a divine becoming.

This modern trajectory creates a theological atmosphere in which the openness of God to history, including being affected by history, is taken as a marker of evangelical authenticity. Open theists, though generally more conservative than Moltmann in other respects, appropriate this ethos: the God who really loves must be vulnerable to surprise, grief, and relational risk. Under exam conditions, one must acknowledge that classical theism has sometimes been articulated in a manner that seems remote, abstract, or insensitive to the biblical pathos of God. Yet the Reformed response is not to cede the ground but to reassert that **impassibility** never meant apathy, but the absence of involuntary suffering or emotional destabilization. In the triune life, God “suffers” in the sense that he has eternally willed to take our misery into himself in Christ; yet this is a free, sovereign determination, not an imposed vulnerability.

The direct architects of open theism as an evangelical project are Clark Pinnock and John Sanders. Pinnock, in works such as The Openness of God and Most Moved Mover, advances an explicitly relational view of God in which the future is partly made up of possibilities rather than settled facts, even for God. This is not ignorance in the classical sense; rather, God knows all that can be known, but future free choices of creatures are not yet there to be known. Pinnock’s method prizes a biblicist appeal to narrative depictions of divine repentance, testing, disappointment, and surprise, combined with a philosophical commitment to libertarian human freedom. He argues that the traditional view of exhaustive definite foreknowledge, when combined with a strong doctrine of providence, collapses human freedom into a compatibilist scheme that undermines moral responsibility and genuine love.

John Sanders systematizes and defends this program in The God Who Risks. For Sanders, a God who exhaustively foreknows a fixed future in detail cannot engage in genuine give-and-take, experiment, or vulnerability with his creatures. Sanders explicitly adopts the language of risk: God has chosen not to control or fully foreknow the future choices of free creatures. His redemptive project can be frustrated, delayed, or altered by creaturely decisions. Divine **providence** is reconfigured as a dynamic, relational steering rather than a comprehensive decree. Divine promises are, in his view, not undergirded by an immutable counsel encompassing all conditions but by God’s resourcefulness and wisdom in navigating genuinely surprising events.

The internal debates within evangelical theology sharpen around several axes. First, the nature of biblical anthropomorphism and anthropopathism. Open theists accuse classical theologians of a de facto Marcionism with respect to the Old Testament God who relents and grieves. Classical theists respond that the hermeneutic of **accommodation** and **analogical language** is not an evasion but a theological necessity grounded in Creator–creature distinction. One must be ready to defend why it is not dishonest for God to say “I did not know” or “now I know” with respect to Abraham in Genesis 22, when, on the classical view, God eternally knows all truths. The answer is that such sayings mark a covenantal testing and public vindication of faith, not a literal alteration in the divine cognitive state. The “now” is located in the creaturely economy, not in the divine intellect.

Second, the nature of freedom. Open theists insist that love and moral responsibility require **libertarian freedom**, understood as the power to do otherwise in exactly the same conditions. On this account, if God infallibly knows today that I will do action A tomorrow, then it is impossible for me to do not-A, and my freedom is illusory. Therefore, to save creaturely liberty, one must deny that there is a determinate truth about my future free act for God to know. Classical Reformed theology, by contrast, deploys a compatibilist account: human freedom consists in acting according to one’s strongest motive or desire without external coercion, even when those desires fall under God’s eternal decree. This is joined to a robust **secondary causality** framework. Exam questions will probe whether compatibilism reduces humans to puppets. The answer depends on maintaining the asymmetry of causation: God’s decree is not located on the same causal plane as creaturely action. God does not force choices from “outside” but eternally wills to concur with the creature’s own operation in a way that secures both his sovereign purpose and the integrity of the creaturely agent.

Third, and perhaps most pastorally charged, is the problem of evil and suffering. Open theists claim that their account offers a superior theodicy: God is not the ultimate planner of specific horrendous evils because he has permitted a world whose future is not fixed, and he suffers along with us as he works creatively to bring good out of tragedy. The classical Reformed response, developed by theologians such as Bruce Ware in his critiques of open theism, insists that this gain is illusory and purchased at the expense of the church’s assurance. A God who did not foresee particular evils cannot promise that they fall within his wise, inscrutable plan. His comforting words in Romans 8 become general intentions rather than inviolable certainties.

Bruce Ware is a decisive contemporary defender of classical theism and a focused critic of open theism. In works like God’s Lesser Glory and in his contributions to multi-view volumes, Ware argues that open theism diminishes God’s glory and undermines key biblical doctrines. He defends **exhaustive definite foreknowledge** on both exegetical and theological grounds, showing that prophecy, divine planning of the cross, and the detailed providence seen in Joseph’s story presuppose not merely general intentions but specific foreknown events. Ware also defends a rehabilitated account of **impassibility** and **immutability**, emphasizing that God’s relational engagement and emotional life in Scripture are expressions of his eternal, unchanging perfections rather than indicators of inner fluctuation or surprise. God’s wrath is the temporal revelation of his fixed opposition to sin. His relenting is the historical disclosure of his eternal mercy as the covenant situation shifts by his own sovereign arrangement.

Here one must grapple with the external challenges open theism raises for classical theism’s coherence. Does the Reformed doctrine of **divine simplicity** make God’s will and knowledge identical with his essence in a way that destroys personal agency and responsiveness? If all that is in God is God, are the various covenantal acts mere shadows of a static, undifferentiated essence? The Reformed scholastic answer is that **simplicity** rules out composition and potentiality in God, not richness or personal liveliness. The one simple essence subsists in three persons whose eternal relations of origin ground genuine interpersonal life, yet without introducing parts. The decree is not a temporal process within God’s mind but a single, timeless act that freely determines all things. Because God is pure act, his willing of creation and redemption is not a new actuality but the eternal, simple act by which he is God. Divine condescension, in this framework, is not a move from nonrelation to relation in God, but the free, eternal decision to bring about temporal relations in which creatures come to participate in the goodness God always is.

A Westminster examiner will press the Christological and covenantal stakes. Does open theism, by introducing ignorance or uncertainty into God’s knowledge of future contingents, compromise the person of Christ? If the incarnate Son is the person of the Logos, then the divine person has exhaustive knowledge of all things. In the communion of idioms, we can say that Jesus knows all future events according to his divine nature while not knowing them according to his human mind, which grows in wisdom. On an open theist view, however, it is not merely that the human mind is ignorant, but that there are no determinate truths to be known about some future free acts. This tension seeps into Christology and threatens to detach the incarnate Son’s historical mission from an infallible divine plan. The cross risks becoming God’s best response to unfolding contingencies rather than the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

The doctrine of the covenant is equally at stake. In Reformed **federal theology**, divine condescension is structured, not ad hoc. The covenants of works and grace, and the eternal covenant of redemption, are instances of God’s free stooping to relate to his creatures by way of sworn promises. The certainty of those promises is tethered to God’s immutable decree and foreknowledge. When God swears to Abraham or to David, the comfort rests in the fact that he cannot lie and that he fully knows all conditions under which the promise will be fulfilled. On an open theist account, covenant promises involve genuine risk of non-fulfillment, contingent on future free acts God cannot perfectly anticipate. This reframes faith from trust in a sovereignly guaranteed oath to trust in God’s good intentions and skill, which may or may not secure the precise outcome envisioned.

The contemporary context amplifies these tensions. Pastoral ministry in a late-modern setting saturated with trauma narratives and a thirst for authenticity naturally gravitates toward a God who appears flexible, emotionally volatile, and reactive. The temptation is to equate authenticity with the denial of **immutability** and **impassibility**. Yet the church’s deepest comfort in suffering has been grounded instead in the stability of God’s character and the completed work of Christ. The doctrine of **divine condescension** in its classical form insists that God really enters our history, bears our sorrows in Christ, and by the Spirit indwells a groaning church, all without surrendering his sovereign rule or timeless perfection. The triune God’s eternal decision to unite himself to humanity in the Son is the maximal expression of relational nearness, not a hesitant, experimental posture.

Taking a firm position, one must say that open theism is not merely an intramural adjustment but a departure from the catholic and Reformed doctrine of God that cannot be harmonized with confessional classical theism. Its rejection of exhaustive definite foreknowledge, its reconfiguration of **providence** into divine risk, and its underlying commitment to libertarian freedom collide with **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and the exhaustive sovereignty affirmed in Reformed standards. Divine condescension, rightly understood, is not God’s adjustment to unknown contingencies but God’s free, eternal determination to reveal himself and to bring creatures into fellowship with himself in a way proportioned to their nature. Anthropomorphic language is not deceptive but accommodated; it tells the truth about how God stands toward us in history, while discipline in analogical reasoning guards us from projecting creaturely modes of being back into God.

In defense against the charge that this position yields a cold, impersonal deity, one must return to the triune center. The Father, Son, and Spirit are eternally and infinitely alive in perichoretic love. This love is not dependent on the world, which is what secures both God’s freedom in creating and his sufficiency in redeeming. The Son’s incarnation and the outpouring of the Spirit in history are the historical enactments of that eternal plenitude. The God who cannot be surprised is also the God whose love cannot fail. He does not risk his purposes; he accomplishes them, though in ways often inscrutable to us. Divine condescension, in this light, is not evidence that God has relaxed his attributes but that he has, in his **immutable freedom**, chosen to draw near in covenant and in Christ so that mutable creatures may truly know and enjoy the one whose being and knowledge admit of no increase.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Open theism holds that the future is partly ontologically open even for God, who lacks exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future free acts; divine condescension, on a classical-Reformed account, is God’s free, eternal decision to reveal himself and relate to creatures in covenant and in Christ without any change in his **simple**, **immutable**, **impassible** being or knowledge.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: Classical **immutability**, **eternity**, and analogical reading of anthropomorphic language.
  - John Calvin: Covenantally framed **accommodation** and **providence**, making divine condescension central without loss of sovereignty.
  - Jürgen Moltmann: Modern suffering-God trajectory that makes divine openness to history a theological virtue.
  - Clark Pinnock and John Sanders: Evangelical architects of open theism, rejecting exhaustive foreknowledge and affirming divine risk for the sake of relationality and libertarian freedom.
  - Bruce Ware: Contemporary Reformed defender of classical theism and critic of open theism, emphasizing **exhaustive foreknowledge**, **impassibility**, and comprehensive **providence**.
- Debates:
  - Internal: How to construe anthropomorphic language, **impassibility**, and **immutability** within classical and Reformed theism while affirming real relationality and pathos.
  - External: Open theism versus classical theism on foreknowledge, freedom, providence, and the coherence of **divine simplicity**.
  - Contemporary: Theodicy, pastoral care, divine emotions, and authenticity in a late-modern context that prizes vulnerability and risk.
- Defended position: A confessional Reformed classical theism in which the triune God, in **immutable freedom**, exhaustively foreknows and decrees all things, yet truly condescends and relates in covenant and in Christ through **analogical**, accommodated revelation, without any revision of **simplicity**, **impassibility**, or **immutability**.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Does classical **immutability** make divine repentance language unreal? No, it locates change in the covenantal economy and in creatures while treating such language as true, accommodated revelation of God’s unchanging will as situations vary.
  - How does compatibilist freedom avoid making humans puppets? By distinguishing God as first cause from creaturely secondary causes, so that God’s decree infallibly encompasses free acts that arise from the agent’s own desires without external coercion.
  - Why is open theism incompatible with Reformed **federal theology**? Because covenant promises and assurance require an immutable decree and exhaustive foreknowledge, not divine risk regarding future conditions.
  - Does **impassibility** deny that God suffers with us? No, it denies involuntary emotional change in God while affirming that God has eternally willed to take our suffering into himself in the incarnate Son.
  - Is **divine simplicity** compatible with responsive providence? Yes, because simplicity rules out composition in God’s being, not multiplicity of temporal effects, so that one simple eternal act of will can ground many distinct responsive acts in history.
