# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the question of **divine condescension** through his distinctive understanding of **God’s self-communication** and the **transcendental structure of human experience**. While not an advocate of **open theism**, Rahner’s theology emphasizes God’s genuine engagement with history and the world, particularly through the **Incarnation**, while maintaining the **immutability** and **omniscience** of God.

- "God’s self-communication in grace is the radical presupposition of all theology." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Trinity
- Hearer of the Word
- Theological Investigations (various volumes)
- Spirit in the World

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Immutability and Transcendence**
    - God remains absolutely **immutable** and transcendent, even in acts of self-communication.
    - Divine condescension does not imply change in God’s being but expresses God’s free, loving initiative.
    - God’s engagement with history is a revelation of God’s eternal will, not a response to temporal events.
    - Rahner rejects any notion that God’s knowledge or will is conditioned by creaturely actions.
    - "God is always the one who gives himself, and this self-giving is not a change in God." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Self-Communication as Divine Condescension**
    - God’s **self-communication** is the central mode of divine condescension.
    - This self-giving is realized supremely in the **Incarnation** and the gift of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - God’s condescension is not a limitation but an expression of divine freedom and love.
    - Human beings are constituted as “hearers of the Word” precisely through this self-communication.
    - "God’s self-communication is the ultimate ground of the possibility of revelation and grace." (The Trinity)

3. **Rejection of Open Theism**
    - Rahner affirms **God’s omniscience** and rejects any limitation of divine foreknowledge.
    - God’s relationship to time is not subject to temporal succession or ignorance of future contingents.
    - Divine condescension does not entail risk or uncertainty for God.
    - The future is eternally present to God, even as God acts within history.
    - "God’s knowledge is not conditioned by the world, but the world is conditioned by God’s knowledge." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)

4. **Transcendental Anthropology and Human Freedom**
    - Human beings are oriented toward God by their very nature as **transcendental subjects**.
    - God’s condescension enables authentic human freedom without compromising divine sovereignty.
    - Human response to grace is real, but always grounded in God’s prior initiative.
    - The drama of salvation history unfolds within the framework of God’s unchanging purpose.
    - "Man is the being who hears the Word of God, and this is possible only because God has first spoken." (Hearer of the Word)

5. **Christology as the Pinnacle of Condescension**
    - The **Incarnation** is the definitive act of divine condescension in Rahner’s theology.
    - In Christ, God enters history without ceasing to be transcendent.
    - The unity of divine and human natures in Christ reveals the possibility and reality of God’s self-giving.
    - Christ’s life, death, and resurrection are the concrete realization of God’s eternal salvific will.
    - "The event of Jesus Christ is the unsurpassable self-communication of God to the world." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s theology of **divine condescension** has deeply influenced modern Catholic thought, especially in its articulation of God’s self-communication and the relationship between transcendence and immanence. His rejection of **open theism** and affirmation of God’s immutability have shaped contemporary debates on divine action and foreknowledge. Rahner remains a pivotal figure for those seeking to understand how God can be both utterly transcendent and intimately involved in human history.
