# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper firmly rejected **open theism**, upholding the classical **Reformed doctrine of God** with its emphasis on **divine sovereignty**, **immutability**, and **omniscience**. Kuyper’s understanding of **divine condescension** was rooted in God’s gracious accommodation to human finitude, but he maintained that such condescension never compromised God’s exhaustive foreknowledge or sovereign rule over history.

- "God’s condescension is not a limitation of His being, but a revelation of His grace." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Sovereignty is Absolute**
    - God’s will governs all things, leaving no room for contingency outside His decree.
    - Human freedom operates within the bounds of God’s sovereign plan.
    - History unfolds according to God’s eternal counsel, not open-ended possibilities.
    - Open theism’s dynamic future is incompatible with Kuyper’s Calvinism.
    - "The sovereignty of God is the starting point of all Reformed theology." (Lectures on Calvinism)

2. **Immutability and Omniscience of God**
    - God’s knowledge is exhaustive, including all actual and possible events.
    - Divine immutability means God’s nature and purposes do not change.
    - Open theism’s claim that God learns or adapts is rejected as unbiblical.
    - God’s foreknowledge is not passive but active and determinative.
    - "God’s knowledge is not subject to time, nor does it grow or diminish." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

3. **Divine Condescension as Gracious Accommodation**
    - God reveals Himself in ways suited to human limitations.
    - Condescension is an act of grace, not a surrender of divine attributes.
    - Accommodation does not entail ignorance or uncertainty in God.
    - Scripture’s anthropomorphic language is understood analogically, not literally.
    - "Condescension is the means by which the infinite God becomes knowable to finite creatures." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

4. **Rejection of Open Theism’s Dynamic Providence**
    - Providence is meticulous, not open or risk-laden.
    - God’s governance extends to every detail of creation and history.
    - Open theism’s model undermines confidence in God’s promises and purposes.
    - Divine responsiveness is real, but always within the framework of God’s eternal decree.
    - "Providence is the continuous, sovereign rule of God over all that He has made." (Lectures on Calvinism)

5. **Scripture as the Norm for Doctrine of God**
    - The doctrine of God must be shaped by the self-revelation of Scripture.
    - Human speculation about divine limitation is subordinated to biblical teaching.
    - Kuyper insists on the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture regarding God’s attributes.
    - Theological innovation, such as open theism, is measured against confessional standards.
    - "We must not go beyond what God has revealed of Himself in His Word." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust defense of **divine sovereignty** and his nuanced articulation of **divine condescension** have shaped Reformed responses to modern challenges like open theism. His insistence on the **immutability** and **omniscience** of God continues to influence confessional theology and the broader Reformed tradition. Kuyper’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between God’s transcendence and His immanence, providing a framework that resists any compromise of classical theism.
