# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame is a leading Reformed critic of **open theism**, insisting that God’s **condescension**—his accommodation to human limitations—never compromises his **sovereignty**, **immutability**, or **omniscience**. He argues that God’s covenantal faithfulness is expressed through his condescension, which is always voluntary and never a limitation of his divine being.

- "God’s condescension is not a limitation of his being, but a mode of his presence with us." (The Doctrine of God)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty is Exhaustive**
    - God’s control extends over all events, including human actions and decisions.
    - Open theism’s limitation of divine knowledge is a denial of biblical sovereignty.
    - Divine sovereignty is fully compatible with genuine human responsibility.
    - God’s decrees are comprehensive and cannot be thwarted.
    "God’s sovereignty is not threatened by his condescension, but is rather expressed through it." (No Other God)

2. **Divine Condescension is Covenantal**
    - God relates to humanity through **covenant**, accommodating his revelation to our finite capacity.
    - Condescension is a voluntary act of God, not a necessity imposed on him.
    - God’s self-limitation in revelation does not entail limitation in his essence.
    - The language of Scripture reflects God’s accommodation to human understanding.
    "God’s covenantal condescension is the means by which he makes himself known to us." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Immutability and Omniscience are Non-Negotiable**
    - God’s knowledge encompasses all things—past, present, and future.
    - Open theism’s denial of exhaustive foreknowledge departs from historic orthodoxy.
    - God’s immutability is compatible with his genuine relational engagement.
    - Divine condescension does not imply any change in God’s being or knowledge.
    "God’s knowledge is not limited by time or by the freedom of his creatures." (No Other God)

4. **Scripture as the Norm for Doctrine**
    - All theological claims must be tested by the authority of **Scripture**.
    - Open theism’s reinterpretation of biblical texts is methodologically flawed.
    - The anthropomorphic language of Scripture is revelatory, not restrictive.
    - The Bible affirms both God’s transcendence and immanence without contradiction.
    "Scripture, not philosophical speculation, must govern our doctrine of God." (The Doctrine of God)

5. **Tri-Perspectival Approach to Theological Method**
    - Theological issues must be viewed from **normative** (God’s law), **situational** (the world), and **existential** (the self) perspectives.
    - Open theism fails to integrate these perspectives, resulting in theological reductionism.
    - Divine condescension is best understood through a multi-perspectival lens.
    - This approach safeguards both God’s majesty and his nearness.
    "We must consider God’s attributes from every perspective to avoid distortion." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s critique of **open theism** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed responses to debates about **divine foreknowledge** and **sovereignty**. His articulation of **divine condescension** as covenantal accommodation offers a robust alternative to both classical theism and open theism. Frame’s tri-perspectival method continues to influence evangelical theology, emphasizing the integration of biblical, theological, and practical concerns in the doctrine of God.
