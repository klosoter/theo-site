# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas firmly rejected **open theism**, upholding a classical doctrine of **divine immutability**, **omniscience**, and **impassibility**. For Aquinas, **divine condescension** is understood through the framework of **analogical language** and the doctrine of **divine simplicity**, ensuring that God’s engagement with creation does not compromise His eternal nature or knowledge.

- "God is pure act, without any potentiality, and so His knowledge is not subject to change." (Summa Theologiae I, q.14, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I, qq. 9–14, 19, 22
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book I, chs. 16–30
- De Potentia Dei
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- The Oxford Handbook of Aquinas (ed. Davies & Stump)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Immutability**
    - God does not change in being, will, or knowledge.
    - Change in God would imply imperfection or potentiality.
    - Scriptural language of change is interpreted analogically.
    - Divine condescension is God’s eternal will applied in time, not a change in God Himself.
    - "God is altogether immutable." (Summa Theologiae I, q.9, a.1)

2. **Divine Omniscience**
    - God knows all things—past, present, and future—in a single, eternal act.
    - God’s knowledge is not discursive or temporal.
    - Open theism’s claim that God learns or responds temporally is rejected.
    - God’s knowledge is the cause of things, not dependent on them.
    - "God’s knowledge is the cause of things." (Summa Theologiae I, q.14, a.8)

3. **Divine Simplicity**
    - God’s attributes are identical with His essence.
    - No composition or division exists in God.
    - God’s actions and knowledge are not parts or accidents.
    - Divine condescension does not introduce complexity into God.
    - "In God, essence and existence are the same." (Summa Theologiae I, q.3, a.4)

4. **Analogical Language about God**
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - Scriptural depictions of God’s “change” or “emotion” are accommodated to human understanding.
    - Divine condescension is a way of speaking about God’s relation to creation, not a literal change.
    - The mystery of God’s transcendence is preserved through analogy.
    - "Whatever is said of God and creatures is said according to an analogy." (Summa Theologiae I, q.13, a.5)

5. **Divine Providence and Sovereignty**
    - God’s providence encompasses all events without being contingent on creation.
    - God’s will is efficacious and unchanging.
    - Divine condescension is the eternal decree applied in time, not a reaction to creaturely freedom.
    - Open theism’s dynamic view of providence is incompatible with Aquinas’s doctrine.
    - "All things are subject to divine providence." (Summa Theologiae I, q.22, a.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s robust defense of **divine immutability** and **simplicity** has shaped the classical Christian doctrine of God, providing a systematic alternative to open theism’s dynamic model. His analogical approach to divine condescension remains foundational for much of **Reformed scholasticism** and Catholic theology. Aquinas’s influence endures in contemporary debates over the nature of God’s knowledge, providence, and relationship to time, serving as a bulwark against revisions that compromise divine transcendence.
