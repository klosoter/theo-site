# Kevin Vanhoozer (1957– )

Kevin Vanhoozer critiques **open theism** for its revision of classical doctrines of **divine omniscience** and **providence**, while affirming a robust account of **divine condescension** rooted in the drama of redemption. He maintains that God’s self-communication in Scripture is both genuinely interactive and consistent with **immutability** and **sovereignty**, rejecting the notion that God’s knowledge or will is limited by creaturely freedom.

- "God’s covenantal condescension is not a compromise of his being but an expression of his communicative love." ("Remythologizing Theology")

## Key Works

- Remythologizing Theology: Divine Action, Passion, and Authorship (2010)
- The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical-Linguistic Approach to Christian Theology (2005)
- First Theology: God, Scripture & Hermeneutics (2002)
- "Does God Suffer?," in The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine (1997)
- "God’s Mighty Speech-Acts: The Doctrine of Scripture Today," in A Pathway into the Holy Scripture (1999)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s communicative condescension is covenantal, not ontological**
    - God freely accommodates himself to human understanding through **revelation**.
    - Divine condescension is an act of **grace**, not a change in God’s essence.
    - The language of Scripture is anthropomorphic but not misleading.
    - God’s self-limitation is a communicative act, not a metaphysical necessity.
    - "God’s condescension is covenantal, not metaphysical; it is a matter of God’s self-commitment, not self-alteration." (Remythologizing Theology)

2. **Rejects open theism’s revision of divine omniscience**
    - God’s knowledge encompasses all actual and possible events, including free human actions.
    - Open theism’s model of divine ignorance about the future undermines biblical **providence**.
    - Divine foreknowledge is compatible with genuine human freedom.
    - God’s relationality does not require ignorance or risk.
    - "God’s knowledge of the future is not a threat to human freedom, but the ground of its possibility." (First Theology)

3. **Affirms the classical doctrine of divine impassibility, reinterpreted through communicative action**
    - God is not subject to involuntary passions but freely engages with creation.
    - Divine impassibility means God is never overwhelmed or manipulated by creation.
    - God’s love is active and responsive, not passive or static.
    - The drama of redemption displays God’s passionate involvement without compromising his perfection.
    - "God is impassible, not because he is unfeeling, but because he is supremely active in his communicative agency." (Remythologizing Theology)

4. **Scripture as the primary locus of divine self-communication**
    - The Bible is the authoritative script for understanding God’s condescension.
    - Divine speech-acts in Scripture reveal God’s intentions and character.
    - The canon shapes the church’s understanding of God’s relationality.
    - Hermeneutics must attend to the dramatic and dialogical nature of revelation.
    - "Scripture is the means by which God draws us into the drama of redemption." (The Drama of Doctrine)

5. **The drama of redemption as the context for understanding divine condescension**
    - God’s engagement with creation is purposeful, aiming at covenant fellowship.
    - The incarnation is the climactic act of divine condescension.
    - God’s actions in history are both sovereign and responsive.
    - The church participates in the ongoing drama of God’s communicative action.
    - "The triune God is the playwright, director, and chief actor in the drama of redemption." (The Drama of Doctrine)

## Legacy and Impact

Vanhoozer’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions of **divine condescension** by integrating **classical theism** with a robust account of God’s communicative action. His critique of open theism has reinforced the coherence of traditional doctrines of **providence** and **omniscience** while offering a dynamic, relational model of God’s interaction with creation. Vanhoozer’s canonical-linguistic approach continues to influence evangelical theology, especially in debates over the nature of God’s knowledge, love, and self-revelation.
