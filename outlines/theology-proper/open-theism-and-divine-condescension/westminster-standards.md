# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards firmly reject **open theism**, upholding a classical doctrine of **divine omniscience**, **immutability**, and **sovereignty**. While affirming **divine condescension**—God’s gracious accommodation to human understanding and history—they maintain that God’s knowledge and will are never contingent upon the creature. The Standards articulate a robust **Creator-creature distinction**, ensuring that God’s self-revelation does not compromise His eternal attributes.

- "God is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions; immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, most wise, most holy, most free, most absolute..." (Westminster Confession of Faith 2.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 2, 3, 5)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 7–11, 12–14)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 4–7)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, "The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Immutability and Omniscience**
    - God is unchangeable in His being, purposes, and knowledge.
    - Divine foreknowledge encompasses all things, actual and possible.
    - God’s decrees are eternal and not reactive to creaturely actions.
    - Open theism’s view of a changing or learning God is explicitly denied.
    - "God from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy counsel of His own will, freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass..." (WCF 3.1)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God is ontologically distinct from creation, not subject to time or limitation.
    - Divine condescension is an act of grace, not necessity or change in God.
    - God’s knowledge and will are not conditioned by the creature.
    - The Standards reject any notion of mutual dependence between God and creation.
    - "There is but one only, living, and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection..." (WCF 2.1)

3. **Divine Condescension as Accommodation**
    - God reveals Himself in ways suited to human capacity.
    - Scriptural anthropomorphisms are understood as figurative, not literal changes in God.
    - Condescension is for the sake of covenantal relationship, not due to ignorance or limitation.
    - The Standards affirm that God’s revelation never compromises His essential attributes.
    - "The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God's part..." (WCF 7.1)

4. **Sovereignty and Providence**
    - God governs all things according to His infallible will.
    - Providence is not contingent on human freedom in an open-ended sense.
    - Human actions are real and significant, but never outside God’s sovereign plan.
    - The Standards deny any limitation of God’s control or knowledge.
    - "God, in his ordinary providence, maketh use of means, yet is free to work without, above, and against them, at his pleasure." (WCF 5.3)

5. **Rejection of Open Theism**
    - The Standards affirm exhaustive divine foreknowledge and deny future contingency for God.
    - God’s emotional life is not subject to change or surprise.
    - The language of Scripture about God’s “repenting” or “changing” is accommodated to human understanding.
    - Open theism is seen as undermining the assurance and certainty of God’s promises.
    - "God is without body, parts, or passions; immutable..." (WCF 2.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have shaped **Reformed orthodoxy** by providing a clear and comprehensive articulation of God’s immutability, omniscience, and sovereign providence. Their doctrine of **divine condescension** safeguards both God’s transcendence and His gracious engagement with creation, decisively rejecting any form of open theism. These commitments continue to inform confessional Presbyterian and Reformed responses to contemporary debates about God’s knowledge and relationship to time, ensuring fidelity to classical theism.
