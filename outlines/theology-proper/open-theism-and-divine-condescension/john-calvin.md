# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin firmly rejected any notion akin to **open theism**, upholding instead the absolute **sovereignty**, **omniscience**, and **immutability** of God. For Calvin, **divine condescension** is not a limitation of God's knowledge or power but a gracious accommodation to human finitude, especially in **revelation** and **covenant**. He maintained that God’s eternal decree encompasses all things, and that God’s self-disclosure is always perfectly consistent with His unchanging nature.

- "For God, in so speaking, lisps with us as nurses are wont to do with little children." (Institutes 1.13.1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Absolute Sovereignty and Omniscience**
    - God’s knowledge is exhaustive, eternal, and not subject to change.
    - All events occur according to God’s eternal **decree**.
    - God’s will is never frustrated by human actions or contingencies.
    - Calvin explicitly denies that God learns or is surprised by creaturely decisions.
    - "Nothing happens but what he has knowingly and willingly decreed." (Institutes 1.16.3)

2. **Immutability of God**
    - God’s nature and purposes do not change over time.
    - Apparent changes in God’s actions are due to human perspective, not divine alteration.
    - Calvin interprets biblical language of God “repenting” or “changing” as anthropomorphic.
    - Divine immutability safeguards the reliability of God’s promises and threats.
    - "When we hear that God repents, we ought to remember that it is not a change of will, but a change of work." (Commentary on Genesis 6:6)

3. **Divine Condescension as Accommodation**
    - God “accommodates” Himself to human capacity in revelation.
    - Anthropomorphic language is a tool for human understanding, not a literal description of God.
    - God’s condescension is an act of grace, not necessity or limitation.
    - Calvin uses the metaphor of God “lisping” to us to explain scriptural language.
    - "For who even of slight intelligence does not understand that, as nurses commonly do with infants, God is wont in a measure to ‘lisp’ in speaking to us?" (Institutes 1.13.1)

4. **Rejection of Open Theism**
    - Calvin denies any limitation in God’s foreknowledge or sovereignty.
    - The future is entirely known and ordained by God, not open or contingent.
    - Human freedom operates within the bounds of divine providence.
    - Open theism’s view of a “risk-taking” God is incompatible with Calvin’s theology.
    - "Ignorance of providence is the greatest of all miseries; the knowledge of it the highest happiness." (Institutes 1.17.11)

5. **Covenant and Divine Initiative**
    - God initiates and sustains the covenant relationship with His people.
    - The covenant is grounded in God’s unchanging promise, not human response.
    - Divine condescension in covenant is a demonstration of God’s mercy, not a response to uncertainty.
    - God’s faithfulness is rooted in His immutable character.
    - "God, in making a covenant with us, does not bind Himself to us as if He could be changed, but rather binds us to Himself." (Commentary on Genesis 17:7)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust doctrine of **divine sovereignty** and his nuanced understanding of **divine condescension** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology and its rejection of open theism. His insistence on God’s **immutability** and exhaustive foreknowledge remains foundational for classical theism. Calvin’s approach to anthropomorphic language in Scripture set a precedent for later theological reflection on how God relates to human beings without compromising His transcendence. His influence endures in contemporary debates over the nature of God’s knowledge and the interpretation of biblical revelation.
