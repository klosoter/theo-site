# John Sanders (1956–)

John Sanders is a leading advocate of **open theism**, a theological position that emphasizes the dynamic and relational nature of God’s interaction with creation, especially regarding **divine foreknowledge** and **providence**. Sanders contends that God sovereignly chooses to allow for genuine human freedom and an open future, while remaining faithful and loving toward his creatures.

- "God has sovereignly decided to make some of his actions contingent upon our requests and actions." ("The God Who Risks")

## Key Works

- The God Who Risks: A Theology of Providence (1998)
- No Other Name: An Investigation into the Destiny of the Unevangelized (1992)
- "Divine Providence and the Openness of God" (in Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views, 2001)
- "Open Theism" (in Four Views on Divine Providence, 2011)
- "Why Simple Foreknowledge Offers No More Providential Control than the Openness of God" (Faith and Philosophy, 1997)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Knowledge of the Future is Dynamic**
    - God knows all possibilities and actualities, but the future is partly open.
    - The openness of the future results from God’s sovereign decision, not from any deficiency.
    - God’s knowledge is exhaustive regarding the past and present, but the future includes genuine contingencies.
    - This approach seeks to uphold both **divine sovereignty** and authentic human freedom.
    "God knows everything that can be known, but the future free actions of creatures are not yet realities to be known." ("The God Who Risks")

2. **Divine Condescension is Relational**
    - God genuinely enters into reciprocal relationships with creatures.
    - Divine condescension involves God adapting to human actions and prayers.
    - God’s love is expressed in vulnerability and responsiveness.
    - The biblical narrative is interpreted as a story of God’s interactive engagement with humanity.
    "God is not a distant, impassible monarch but a relational being who responds to his creatures." ("The God Who Risks")

3. **Providence as Risk and Partnership**
    - God’s providence is not deterministic but involves real risk.
    - God invites humans into partnership, making some outcomes contingent on their choices.
    - Divine providence is exercised through persuasion and influence, not coercion.
    - God’s ultimate purposes will be accomplished, but the route may vary due to creaturely freedom.
    "God takes risks because he values loving relationships over unilateral control." ("The God Who Risks")

4. **Scripture Interpreted as Dynamic Narrative**
    - The Bible presents God as interacting, changing plans, and responding to prayer.
    - Anthropomorphic language is taken seriously as revealing God’s genuine relationality.
    - Passages depicting God’s repentance or change of mind are not dismissed as mere accommodation.
    - This narrative approach challenges classical theism’s emphasis on **immutability** and **impassibility**.
    "The biblical God is portrayed as flexible and responsive, not static and unchangeable." ("The God Who Risks")

5. **Critique of Classical Theism**
    - Sanders critiques the traditional view of **divine immutability** and exhaustive foreknowledge.
    - He argues that classical theism undermines the reality of human freedom and relationality.
    - Open theism offers a more coherent account of evil, prayer, and divine love.
    - The model seeks to be faithful to both Scripture and the lived experience of faith.
    "Classical theism’s God is often too remote to be the loving Father revealed in Jesus Christ." ("The God Who Risks")

## Legacy and Impact

John Sanders has played a pivotal role in shaping the contemporary debate over **open theism**, challenging traditional accounts of **divine foreknowledge** and **providence**. His work has prompted theologians to reconsider the relational dynamics between God and creation and has broadened the conversation about the character of God in systematic theology. Sanders’s emphasis on **divine condescension** and genuine human freedom continues to influence discussions on the interpretation of Scripture and the nature of God.
