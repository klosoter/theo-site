# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached questions of **divine condescension** and the nature of God's knowledge through his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. While not an advocate of **open theism**, Bultmann challenged traditional views of **divine immutability** and **omniscience** by emphasizing the existential encounter between God and humanity in the act of faith. For Bultmann, God's "condescension" is realized not in metaphysical changes within God, but in the **kerygma**—the proclaimed word that confronts individuals in their historical existence.

- "God is not a thing or a being at all, but the power that encounters man in the word of proclamation." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
   - Scripture must be interpreted existentially, not as literal history.
   - Mythological language about God is reinterpreted as existential truth.
   - Divine actions (including condescension) are symbolic of God’s address to human existence.
   - The focus is on the meaning of the text for the present believer.
   - "The real purpose of myth is not to present an objective picture of the world as it is, but to express man's understanding of himself in the world in which he lives." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter with God**
   - God is encountered in the **kerygma**, not in metaphysical speculation.
   - Divine condescension is the event of God addressing the individual.
   - The existential response of faith is central to the divine-human relationship.
   - God’s knowledge is not a topic for speculation but for existential decision.
   - "Faith is the abandonment of every human security and the readiness to accept the divine decision." (Faith and Understanding)

3. **Rejection of Objectivist Metaphysics**
   - Traditional attributes like **immutability** and **omniscience** are not central.
   - God is not a being among beings, but the ground of existential encounter.
   - Theological language is meaningful only as it relates to human existence.
   - Open theism’s focus on God’s temporal knowledge is seen as misplaced.
   - "God is not an object in the world but the ground of meaning for existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
   - The proclaimed word is where God’s condescension is realized.
   - The kerygma confronts each person in their historical situation.
   - Divine action is not about intervention in history but existential transformation.
   - The meaning of Christ’s incarnation is existential, not metaphysical.
   - "The kerygma is not a mythological report but the proclamation of an event that is always present." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Faith as Existential Decision**
   - Faith is a personal, existential response to God’s address.
   - Divine condescension is experienced in the call to authentic existence.
   - The future is open in the sense of existential possibility, not divine ignorance.
   - Salvation is not about knowledge of God’s plan, but about authentic existence before God.
   - "Faith means decision here and now, in the moment of encounter with the word." (Existence and Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **divine condescension** has profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in its emphasis on the **kerygma** and the existential encounter with God. While he did not advocate for open theism, his rejection of classical metaphysics and focus on the existential dimension of faith paved the way for later discussions about the nature of God’s knowledge and relationship to time. Bultmann remains a pivotal figure in debates over the relevance of traditional doctrines in a modern, post-metaphysical context. His influence endures in both biblical interpretation and contemporary theology’s engagement with existentialist thought.
