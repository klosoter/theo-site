# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer addressed **divine condescension** and God's knowledge from a classical **Reformed** perspective, critically engaging contemporary challenges such as **open theism**. He emphasized the mystery of God's **sovereignty** and **omniscience**, insisting that God's self-revelation in Scripture involves genuine accommodation to human understanding without compromising His **immutability**.

- "The knowledge of God is never abstract, but always related to His redemptive purpose and revelation." (The Providence of God)

## Key Works

- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Revelation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Omniscience Maintained**
    - God’s knowledge encompasses all things, past, present, and future, without limitation.
    - Berkouwer rejects any suggestion that God learns or is surprised by creaturely actions.
    - He upholds the classical doctrine of **God’s immutability** in relation to knowledge.
    - Open theism’s limitation of divine foreknowledge is seen as incompatible with biblical revelation.
    "God’s knowledge is not a passive awareness, but an active, sovereign knowing." (The Providence of God)

2. **Condescension as Gracious Accommodation**
    - God’s self-revelation is always an act of condescension, adapting to human finitude.
    - Berkouwer stresses that accommodation does not entail error or limitation in God.
    - He draws on the Reformed tradition’s emphasis on **covenantal condescension**.
    - Divine accommodation serves the purpose of redemptive revelation, not ontological change.
    "God’s condescension is not a surrender of His majesty, but a revelation of His grace." (The Knowledge of God)

3. **Rejection of Open Theism’s Dynamic View of God**
    - Berkouwer critiques any theology that posits real change or ignorance in God.
    - He maintains that God’s relationship to time is not subject to creaturely limitations.
    - The biblical language of God “relenting” or “changing” is understood as anthropomorphic.
    - Open theism’s emphasis on divine risk undermines the assurance of providence.
    "The biblical witness to God’s repentance must be understood in the light of His unchanging faithfulness." (The Providence of God)

4. **Scripture as Normative for Divine Attributes**
    - Berkouwer insists that all theological reflection on God’s knowledge and condescension must be normed by **Scripture**.
    - He warns against speculative philosophy that goes beyond biblical revelation.
    - The tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility is to be held, not resolved by diminishing either.
    - Exegesis of key texts (e.g., God’s “repentance”) must respect the analogical nature of theological language.
    "We must not allow philosophical constructions to dictate the content of our doctrine of God." (Holy Scripture)

5. **Mystery and Humility in Theological Method**
    - Berkouwer emphasizes the mystery inherent in the doctrine of God.
    - He cautions against rationalizing or systematizing away biblical tensions.
    - The limits of human knowledge call for humility before the revealed God.
    - Theological humility guards against both open theist revisionism and rigid scholasticism.
    "The mystery of God’s being and action calls us to reverence, not speculation." (The Knowledge of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s engagement with **divine condescension** and his critique of open theism have shaped Reformed responses to contemporary debates about God’s knowledge and providence. His insistence on the priority of **Scripture** and the necessity of theological humility has influenced both academic and ecclesial discussions. Berkouwer’s nuanced approach continues to serve as a resource for those seeking to uphold the classical attributes of God while taking seriously the biblical witness to His relational engagement with creation.
