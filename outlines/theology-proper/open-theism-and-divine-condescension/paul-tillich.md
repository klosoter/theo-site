# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the question of **divine condescension** and the challenges posed by **open theism** through his framework of **God as the Ground of Being** and his doctrine of **divine self-limitation**. Rather than affirming a mutable or passible God, Tillich emphasized the **paradox of divine transcendence and immanence**, arguing that God participates in history without surrendering the divine essence. For Tillich, God's engagement with the world is an expression of **creative self-giving** rather than a limitation of omniscience or sovereignty.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as the Ground of Being**
    - God is not a being among beings but the very basis of all existence.
    - Divine reality transcends all finite categories, including time and change.
    - God's relationship to the world is ontological, not merely causal or temporal.
    - This view resists any notion of God being affected or changed by temporal events.
    - "He is being-itself, not a being." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

2. **Divine Self-Limitation as Creative Love**
    - God's engagement with creation is an act of **kenosis** or self-giving, not a loss of sovereignty.
    - Divine condescension is understood as the free act of love, not a necessity imposed by creation.
    - God remains fully transcendent while being present in the existential struggles of humanity.
    - This self-limitation is an expression of divine power, not weakness.
    - "The power of being is manifest in the power of self-surrender." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Classical Theism’s Static God**
    - Tillich critiques the notion of God as wholly immutable and impassible.
    - He affirms that God is dynamically related to the world, yet not subject to change.
    - Divine participation in history is real, but does not compromise divine essence.
    - God’s eternity is not timelessness but the fullness of all time.
    - "God is living, and this means that God is related to the temporal process." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

4. **Symbolic and Existential Language about God**
    - All language about God is symbolic, pointing beyond itself to the ultimate.
    - Anthropomorphic descriptions of God’s condescension are existential symbols.
    - Open theism’s literalism about divine change is rejected as inadequate.
    - The symbols of divine love and response express existential truth, not metaphysical alteration.
    - "Every statement about God is symbolic." (Systematic Theology, vol. 1)

5. **Divine Knowledge and Freedom**
    - God’s knowledge encompasses all possibilities and actualities without being determined by them.
    - Divine freedom is not constrained by creation or history.
    - God’s foreknowledge is not temporal prediction but eternal vision.
    - Open theism’s view of divine ignorance of the future is incompatible with Tillich’s ontology.
    - "God knows all things as they are rooted in the divine ground." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **divine condescension** and the questions raised by **open theism** has influenced modern theology’s engagement with the relationship between God and history. His emphasis on **God as the Ground of Being** and the symbolic nature of theological language provided a framework for addressing divine immanence without sacrificing transcendence. While Tillich’s views diverge from both classical theism and open theism, his work remains a significant resource for those seeking to articulate a dynamic yet ontologically robust doctrine of God. His legacy endures in contemporary discussions of **divine self-limitation** and the existential meaning of God’s presence in the world.
