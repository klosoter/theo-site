# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til firmly rejected **open theism**, insisting on the absolute **sovereignty** and **immutability** of God as foundational to **Reformed theology**. For Van Til, genuine **divine condescension** is not a compromise of God's essential attributes but the means by which the Creator relates to the creature through **covenant** and **analogical revelation**.

- "God does not change in his being or in his knowledge, but he does truly relate to his creatures in history." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Absolute Sovereignty and Immutability**
    - God’s knowledge and will are exhaustive and unchanging.
    - Any limitation of divine foreknowledge undermines the Creator-creature distinction.
    - Open theism’s view of God’s ignorance of future contingents is incompatible with Reformed confessions.
    - Divine condescension is not a change in God but a covenantal adaptation to human finitude.
    - "God’s counsel is all-comprehensive and certain, and nothing can come to pass except that which he has determined." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God is qualitatively distinct from creation; his being and knowledge are not on a continuum with ours.
    - Open theism blurs this distinction by making God’s knowledge reactive.
    - Divine condescension is God’s voluntary act, not a necessity imposed by creation.
    - All revelation is analogical, not univocal, preserving God’s transcendence.
    - "There is no point of identity between the divine and the human consciousness." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Covenantal Condescension**
    - God relates to humanity through covenant, accommodating his revelation to human capacity.
    - Condescension is a matter of God’s self-revelation, not a change in his essence or knowledge.
    - The covenant framework safeguards both God’s transcendence and immanence.
    - Open theism misconstrues covenant as mutual limitation rather than sovereign initiative.
    - "God comes down to man, not by ceasing to be God, but by covenantally revealing himself." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Analogical Knowledge and Revelation**
    - Human knowledge of God is always analogical, never exhaustive or identical to God’s self-knowledge.
    - Open theism’s insistence on exhaustive divine-human relationality fails to respect this analogical principle.
    - Divine condescension is the means by which God makes himself known without compromising his incomprehensibility.
    - Scripture’s anthropomorphic language is revelatory accommodation, not ontological limitation.
    - "All our knowledge is at best a reinterpretation of God’s knowledge after him." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Rejection of Process and Open Theism**
    - Van Til explicitly opposed all forms of process theology and open theism as incompatible with biblical theism.
    - He saw these views as capitulations to autonomous human reasoning and modern philosophy.
    - Divine freedom and sovereignty are not threatened by genuine human responsibility.
    - The mystery of divine condescension is resolved in the Creator-creature distinction, not by limiting God.
    - "To make God dependent on the world is to destroy the very foundation of Christian theism." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of **divine immutability** and the **Creator-creature distinction** has shaped Reformed responses to open theism and process theology. His emphasis on **covenantal condescension** and analogical knowledge remains central to contemporary discussions of how God relates to the world. Van Til’s critique of open theism continues to influence confessional Reformed theologians, ensuring that divine sovereignty and transcendence are not compromised in the name of relationality.
