# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s approach to **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** is rooted in his strong affirmation of God’s absolute sovereignty and the radical distinction between the hidden and revealed God. He insists that God’s will is the ultimate cause of all things, yet maintains that God is not the author of evil in a way that compromises His righteousness. Luther’s theology emphasizes the mystery of **predestination** and the necessity of faith in God’s promises, even amid suffering and apparent contradictions.

- "For God does not will sin, but He permits it; and yet He does not permit it unwillingly, but willingly." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty and Foreknowledge**
   - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all events, including human actions.
   - Divine foreknowledge is comprehensive and infallible, encompassing all things past, present, and future.
   - God’s knowledge does not depend on human choices or contingencies.
   - Human freedom is subordinate to God’s sovereign will.
   - "Everything that happens, happens not only by the permission of God, but by His will and pleasure." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Distinction Between Hidden and Revealed God**
   - God’s hidden will (Deus absconditus) is inscrutable and beyond human comprehension.
   - The revealed God (Deus revelatus) is known in Christ and the promises of the Gospel.
   - The problem of evil is ultimately a mystery rooted in God’s hidden counsel.
   - Believers are called to trust God’s goodness as revealed in Christ, not to speculate about His secret purposes.
   - "We must keep in view the revealed God and avoid speculation about the hidden God." (The Bondage of the Will)

3. **Providence and Human Responsibility**
   - God governs all things by His providence, yet humans remain morally responsible.
   - Human actions are secondary causes within God’s overarching providential plan.
   - The coexistence of divine sovereignty and human responsibility is affirmed, not explained away.
   - Sin is permitted by God but arises from the corrupt will of creatures.
   - "God works all in all, even in the wicked; but He does not work evil through them, but good." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **The Problem of Evil and the Cross**
   - The reality of evil and suffering is interpreted through the theology of the cross.
   - God’s ultimate answer to evil is found in Christ’s suffering and redemption.
   - The cross reveals God’s solidarity with human suffering and His victory over evil.
   - Christians are called to faith amid suffering, trusting in God’s promises.
   - "He is present even where He seems most to hide Himself and forsake us." (Heidelberg Disputation)

5. **Predestination and Assurance**
   - Predestination is grounded in God’s gracious will, not human merit.
   - The doctrine is meant to comfort believers, not to foster despair or speculation.
   - Assurance comes from clinging to Christ and the promises of the Gospel.
   - The elect are known by faith, not by prying into God’s secret counsel.
   - "Let Christ be the mirror in which we contemplate our election." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust doctrine of **divine sovereignty** and his distinction between the hidden and revealed God have profoundly shaped Protestant approaches to **providence** and the **problem of evil**. His emphasis on the mystery of God’s will and the necessity of faith in Christ continues to influence Reformation and post-Reformation theology. Luther’s thought remains a touchstone for discussions of predestination, human responsibility, and the meaning of suffering in the Christian life.
