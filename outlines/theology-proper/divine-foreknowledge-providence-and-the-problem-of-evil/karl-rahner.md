# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** through the lens of his transcendental theology, emphasizing both the mystery of God and the freedom of human beings. He sought to reconcile the reality of evil with a God who is both omniscient and loving, insisting on the compatibility of **human freedom** and **God’s universal salvific will**. Rahner’s thought is marked by a deep commitment to the incomprehensibility of God’s ways and the necessity of faith in the face of suffering.

- "The Christian must hold that God is the Lord of history, and that even the evil in the world is encompassed by his providence." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Transcendence and Immanence**
    - God is utterly transcendent, yet intimately present to creation.
    - Divine action is not competitive with creaturely causality.
    - Providence operates through both natural processes and personal history.
    - God’s knowledge and will are not bound by temporal sequence.
    - "God is always greater than anything we can say or think about him." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Compatibility of Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom**
    - God’s foreknowledge does not negate authentic human freedom.
    - Human decisions are truly contingent, yet known eternally by God.
    - God’s knowledge is not causal in the same way as human knowledge.
    - The mystery of freedom is preserved within God’s providential plan.
    - "God’s knowledge of the future is not a threat to our freedom, but its ground." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Providence as Universal and Salvific**
    - God’s providence extends to all creation and every human being.
    - The universal salvific will of God is central to Rahner’s theology.
    - Providence is not deterministic but oriented toward the offer of grace.
    - God works through history to bring about redemption, even through suffering.
    - "God’s will to save is universal and concrete in every individual’s life." (Theological Investigations, vol. 9)

4. **The Mystery of Evil and the Necessity of Faith**
    - The existence of evil is ultimately a mystery that cannot be fully explained.
    - Faith is required to trust in God’s goodness despite the presence of evil.
    - Evil is permitted, not willed, by God for the sake of greater goods.
    - The cross of Christ is the definitive revelation of God’s response to evil.
    - "The problem of evil is not solved theoretically, but in the existential act of faith." (Theological Investigations, vol. 9)

5. **Anthropological Orientation and the Role of Freedom**
    - Human beings are oriented toward God as the horizon of their existence.
    - Freedom is the condition for the possibility of both love and evil.
    - The drama of salvation unfolds within the context of human decision.
    - God’s grace is always offered, but not irresistibly imposed.
    - "Man is the being who must decide for or against God in freedom." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s approach to **divine providence** and the **problem of evil** has profoundly shaped contemporary Catholic theology, especially in its emphasis on the mystery of God and the dignity of human freedom. His transcendental method provided a framework for integrating modern philosophical insights with traditional doctrines. Rahner’s influence endures in discussions of theodicy, grace, and the relationship between God’s knowledge and human history, making him a pivotal figure in twentieth-century theology.
