# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** from a consistently **Reformed** and **presuppositional** standpoint. He emphasized the absolute **sovereignty of God**, the **Creator-creature distinction**, and the necessity of grounding all knowledge, including the reality of evil, in the **self-revelation of God**. For Van Til, the apparent tension between God's providence and the existence of evil is resolved within the **Trinitarian** framework of Christian theism.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Sovereignty of God**
    - God’s **foreknowledge** and **providence** are exhaustive and comprehensive.
    - Nothing occurs outside of God’s eternal decree, including evil.
    - Human history unfolds according to God’s infallible plan.
    - God’s sovereignty is not compromised by the reality of evil.
    - "God’s counsel controls whatsoever comes to pass." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God’s knowledge and being are qualitatively distinct from that of creatures.
    - Human attempts to judge God’s providence by autonomous reason are invalid.
    - The problem of evil cannot be solved on neutral philosophical grounds.
    - True understanding requires submission to God’s self-revelation.
    - "We must not seek to understand God’s counsel by placing ourselves on His level." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Presuppositional Apologetics**
    - All reasoning about evil and providence presupposes a worldview.
    - Only the Christian worldview provides the preconditions for intelligibility.
    - The problem of evil is insoluble apart from the triune God.
    - Unbelieving thought suppresses the truth of God’s providence.
    - "The Christian answer to the problem of evil is based upon the presupposition of the self-attesting Christ of Scripture." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Compatibilism of Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God ordains all things, yet humans are morally responsible.
    - There is no contradiction between God’s decree and human freedom rightly defined.
    - Evil actions are included in God’s plan without making God the author of sin.
    - Mystery remains, but Scripture affirms both truths.
    - "The fact that God controls evil does not make Him the author of sin." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Trinitarian Theism as the Solution**
    - The doctrine of the Trinity provides the only coherent basis for unity and diversity.
    - The problem of evil is ultimately theological, not merely philosophical.
    - God’s triune nature ensures that His providence is personal and purposeful.
    - The Christian answer to evil is rooted in the redemptive work of Christ.
    - "It is only in the light of the ontological Trinity that the problem of evil can be understood." (A Survey of Christian Epistemology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **divine providence** and the **problem of evil** has profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics, especially through his emphasis on presuppositionalism and the necessity of a Trinitarian worldview. His insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the self-attesting authority of Scripture continues to influence contemporary discussions on theodicy. While some critique his approach as overly dismissive of philosophical engagement, Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of Reformed epistemology and apologetics.
