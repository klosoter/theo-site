# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of **divine foreknowledge** and **providence** is rooted in the absolute sovereignty of God over all things, including the existence of **evil**. He affirms that God’s **decree** encompasses every event, yet God remains perfectly holy and just, never the author of sin. Calvin’s approach to the **problem of evil** insists on the mystery of God’s will, while upholding human responsibility and the goodness of God’s purposes.

- "But God, who by the mere light of nature is known to be just and good, permits nothing but what is both righteous and expedient." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, I.xviii.3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Sovereignty of God**
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all things, including the course of history and individual events.
    - Nothing occurs apart from God’s eternal **decree**.
    - God’s sovereignty is not limited by human freedom or chance.
    - All things, including evil, are under God’s providential control.
    - "For nothing is more absurd than to imagine any event or accident which God has not decreed." (Institutes I.xvi.4)

2. **Comprehensive Divine Providence**
    - Providence is God’s ongoing governance and preservation of creation.
    - God uses secondary causes but remains the primary cause of all that happens.
    - Providence extends to both great and small events, even the fall of a sparrow.
    - God’s providence is wise, just, and always directed toward His glory and the good of His people.
    - "God so attends to the regulation of individual events, and they all so proceed from his set plan, that nothing takes place by chance." (Institutes I.xvi.4)

3. **Distinction Between God’s Will and Human Sin**
    - God ordains even sinful acts without being morally culpable.
    - Human agents are responsible for their evil actions, acting according to their own wills.
    - God’s permission of evil serves His righteous and inscrutable purposes.
    - The distinction between God’s secret will and revealed will preserves His holiness.
    - "For the will of God is the supreme rule of righteousness, so that everything which he wills must be held to be righteous by the mere fact of his willing it." (Institutes III.xxiii.2)

4. **Mystery and Humility in the Face of Evil**
    - The ultimate reasons for God’s allowance of evil are often hidden.
    - Calvin counsels humility and reverence before the mystery of God’s providence.
    - Speculation beyond Scripture is discouraged; faith rests in God’s revealed character.
    - The problem of evil is not fully resolved but placed within the context of God’s wisdom.
    - "Let us not be ashamed to be ignorant in a matter in which ignorance is learning." (Institutes III.xxi.2)

5. **Human Responsibility and Divine Sovereignty**
    - Human choices are real and significant within God’s sovereign plan.
    - God’s foreordination does not coerce or negate human will.
    - The coexistence of divine sovereignty and human responsibility is affirmed, not explained away.
    - Moral exhortation and accountability remain essential in Calvin’s theology.
    - "Man falls according to God’s providence, but he falls by his own fault." (Institutes I.xviii.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust doctrine of **providence** has profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition’s approach to divine sovereignty and the problem of evil. His careful distinctions between God’s will and human agency continue to influence discussions on **theodicy** and predestination. While Calvin’s views have been critiqued for their tension between sovereignty and responsibility, his insistence on mystery and humility remains a hallmark of Reformed theology. His legacy endures in both academic and pastoral contexts, especially regarding the trustworthiness of God amid suffering and evil.
