# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically reoriented the doctrines of **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** by centering them on the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ. He rejected classical theistic notions of a remote, deterministic God, insisting instead that God's sovereignty is exercised in personal, covenantal freedom, and that evil is a reality God opposes and overcomes in Christ.

- "God’s providence is the sovereignty of His love, the sovereignty in which He is Lord and Master over all that is not Himself." (Church Dogmatics III/3)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics, Vol. II/1: The Doctrine of God
- Church Dogmatics, Vol. III/3: The Doctrine of Creation, Part 3
- Church Dogmatics, Vol. IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- Karl Barth: Theologian of Freedom (John Webster)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Doctrine of Providence**
   - God’s providence is revealed and enacted in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
   - Providence is not abstract control but concrete, loving lordship.
   - All history and creation are ordered toward the fulfillment found in Christ.
   - God’s governance is personal and relational, not mechanistic.
   - "In Jesus Christ, God’s providence is not an idea but a reality." (Church Dogmatics III/3)

2. **Divine Freedom and Sovereignty**
   - God’s freedom is not arbitrary but is the freedom to love and to be for humanity.
   - Divine foreknowledge is not deterministic; it is the knowledge of the covenantal God.
   - God’s sovereignty is exercised in grace, not in fate or necessity.
   - God is not bound by creation but freely relates to it.
   - "God is free in His grace, and His sovereignty is the sovereignty of His love." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

3. **Evil as the ‘Nothingness’ Opposed by God**
   - Evil is not a substance but a negation, a ‘nothingness’ that God opposes.
   - God permits evil only as that which He has already judged and overcome in Christ.
   - Evil has no ultimate reality or positive role in God’s will.
   - The problem of evil is addressed in the cross and resurrection.
   - "Evil is that which God has rejected and overcome in Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics III/3)

4. **Providence and Human Responsibility**
   - Human beings are genuine agents within God’s providential ordering.
   - Providence does not negate but establishes human freedom and responsibility.
   - God’s guidance includes human participation and response.
   - The meaning of history is found in the divine-human encounter.
   - "God’s providence does not abolish but confirms human responsibility." (Church Dogmatics III/3)

5. **Rejection of Theodicy as Justification of God**
   - Barth refuses to justify God in the face of evil by rational explanation.
   - The answer to evil is not philosophical but theological, found in Christ alone.
   - God’s righteousness is revealed in His self-giving, not in abstract principles.
   - The mystery of evil is met by the greater mystery of God’s grace.
   - "We cannot justify God; we can only bear witness to His justification of Himself in Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s **Christocentric** reframing of providence and evil has profoundly shaped modern theology, challenging both classical theism and modern theodicies. His insistence on God’s sovereign freedom and the centrality of Christ has influenced Reformed and ecumenical thought alike. Barth’s approach continues to provoke debate about the relationship between divine sovereignty, human freedom, and the reality of evil, ensuring his ongoing relevance in discussions of **providence** and the **problem of evil**.
