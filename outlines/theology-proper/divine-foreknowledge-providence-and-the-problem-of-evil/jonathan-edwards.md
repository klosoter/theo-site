# Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758)

Jonathan Edwards articulated a robust vision of **divine foreknowledge** and **providence** grounded in the absolute sovereignty of God, affirming that all events—including evil—unfold according to God's **decree** without compromising human responsibility. He maintained that God's **omniscience** and **meticulous providence** are compatible with the existence of evil, which ultimately serves the greater manifestation of God's **glory** and **justice**.

- "God decrees all things, and yet He is not the author of sin." (Freedom of the Will)

- Freedom of the Will
- The End for Which God Created the World

- Miscellanies (notebooks)
- The Nature of True Virtue

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Divine Sovereignty**
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all that happens, including the course of history and individual events.
    - Nothing occurs outside the scope of God’s **decree** and **providence**.
    - God’s sovereignty is not limited by human freedom or the existence of evil.
    - All things, even evil, are ordered toward God’s ultimate purposes.
    - "God orders all things whatsoever comes to pass, yet He is not the author of sin." (Freedom of the Will)

2. **Compatibilist Human Freedom**
    - Human choices are genuinely free when they accord with one’s strongest inclinations or desires.
    - Divine foreknowledge and sovereignty do not negate moral responsibility.
    - God’s foreordination is compatible with human accountability for sin.
    - The will is determined by motives, which are themselves under God’s providence.
    - "The essence of the virtue and vice of dispositions of the heart, and acts of the will, lies not in their cause, but their nature." (Freedom of the Will)

3. **God’s Omniscience and Foreknowledge**
    - God possesses exhaustive, infallible knowledge of all things past, present, and future.
    - Divine foreknowledge is grounded in God’s eternal decree.
    - God knows all possible worlds and actualizes the one that best displays His glory.
    - There is no contradiction between God’s foreknowledge and the contingency of created events.
    - "God’s knowledge is the foundation of things, rather than things the foundation of God’s knowledge." (Miscellanies)

4. **Providence and the Problem of Evil**
    - Evil exists within the bounds of God’s providential plan, serving a greater good.
    - God permits evil for the manifestation of His **justice**, **mercy**, and **glory**.
    - The existence of evil does not impugn God’s goodness or holiness.
    - Evil is not directly caused by God but is used by Him for wise and holy ends.
    - "God would not have permitted evil if He could not bring good out of it." (The End for Which God Created the World)

5. **The Glory of God as Ultimate Purpose**
    - The ultimate end of all things, including evil, is the display of God’s glory.
    - God’s providence is directed toward the fullest revelation of His attributes.
    - The existence of evil provides a backdrop for the greater display of God’s grace and justice.
    - All created reality is subordinate to the divine purpose of glorifying God.
    - "The glory of God is the ultimate end of the creation of the world." (The End for Which God Created the World)

## Legacy and Impact

Edwards’ articulation of **divine sovereignty** and compatibilist freedom has profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to the problem of evil and the doctrine of providence. His rigorous defense of God’s absolute foreknowledge and providential control remains influential in both philosophical and theological circles. Edwards’ thought continues to inform debates on the compatibility of divine sovereignty with human responsibility, and his vision of God’s glory as the ultimate purpose of all things remains a hallmark of Reformed theology.
