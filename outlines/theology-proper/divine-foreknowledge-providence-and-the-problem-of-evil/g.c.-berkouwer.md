# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer addressed **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** by emphasizing the dynamic relationship between God's sovereignty and human responsibility. He rejected deterministic views, instead highlighting the mystery of God's governance and the reality of evil within the context of **redemptive history**. Berkouwer sought to uphold the biblical witness to God's control while resisting speculative solutions that undermine the seriousness of evil or human agency.

- "The confession of providence is not a theoretical explanation of the world, but a confession of faith in the living God who governs all things." (The Providence of God)

## Key Works

- The Providence of God (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Sin (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Faith and Justification
- General Revelation
- Holy Scripture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Providence as Personal and Relational**
   - God’s providence is not abstract control but a personal, covenantal engagement with creation.
   - Emphasizes the biblical narrative over philosophical speculation.
   - Providence is understood in the context of God’s faithfulness and promises.
   - Rejects impersonal causality in favor of God’s purposeful guidance.
   - "Providence is not a system but a confession of faith in the living God." (The Providence of God)

2. **Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom**
   - Affirms God’s exhaustive foreknowledge without negating genuine human responsibility.
   - Warns against speculative attempts to harmonize divine sovereignty and freedom.
   - Stresses the mystery inherent in the biblical witness.
   - Human actions are real and significant within God’s providential plan.
   - "Scripture does not solve the problem of the relation between God’s knowledge and human freedom, but it does not ignore it either." (The Providence of God)

3. **The Problem of Evil as Theological Mystery**
   - Evil is a profound mystery, not to be rationalized or minimized.
   - Rejects theodicies that attempt to justify evil as necessary or good.
   - Evil is real and opposed to God’s will, yet not outside His sovereignty.
   - The cross of Christ is central to understanding God’s response to evil.
   - "The reality of evil is not explained away, but is placed within the context of God’s redemptive work." (Sin)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective**
   - Interprets providence and evil within the unfolding drama of redemption.
   - God’s governance is oriented toward the fulfillment of His redemptive purposes.
   - The problem of evil is addressed eschatologically, not philosophically.
   - Emphasizes the hope of new creation as the ultimate answer to evil.
   - "The problem of evil is not solved by speculation, but by the promise of God’s final victory." (Sin)

5. **Critical Engagement with Reformed Tradition**
   - Engages critically with classical Reformed doctrines of providence and predestination.
   - Seeks to avoid both fatalism and Pelagianism.
   - Affirms the confessions while calling for continual theological reflection.
   - Encourages humility before the mystery of God’s ways.
   - "The Reformed confession does not claim to unravel the mystery, but to confess God’s sovereignty in faith." (The Providence of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced approach to **providence** and the **problem of evil** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by encouraging humility and faithfulness to Scripture rather than speculative system-building. His emphasis on the redemptive-historical context and the personal nature of God’s governance has shaped discussions on divine sovereignty and human responsibility. Berkouwer’s legacy endures in his insistence that theological reflection must remain rooted in the biblical narrative and the confession of faith.
