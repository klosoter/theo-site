# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** through a robustly theocentric and Reformed lens, emphasizing God's exhaustive sovereignty and the coherence of God's control with human responsibility. He insists that God's knowledge and governance are comprehensive, yet never compromise His goodness or the meaningfulness of creaturely action, resolving tensions through his **triperspectivalism** and a strong doctrine of **compatibilism**.

- "God controls everything that happens, and yet human choices are real and significant." ("The Doctrine of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God (A Theology of Lordship, Vol. 2)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- No Other God: A Response to Open Theism
- Perspectives on the Doctrine of God: 4 Views (contributor)
- "Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility" (in various essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Exhaustive Divine Sovereignty**
    - God’s **providence** extends to all events, including evil, without exception.
    - Nothing occurs outside of God’s **decretive will** or foreknowledge.
    - Divine sovereignty is compatible with genuine human agency.
    - God’s control is personal, wise, and purposeful, not mechanical.
    - "God’s sovereignty is comprehensive, extending to the smallest details of creation." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Triperspectival Approach to Providence**
    - Analyzes providence through **normative** (God’s law), **situational** (world events), and **existential** (human experience) perspectives.
    - Each perspective is interdependent and necessary for a full understanding.
    - This approach helps clarify the relationship between God’s control and human action.
    - It avoids reductionism by honoring the complexity of biblical teaching.
    - "We must see providence from the perspectives of God’s plan, the world’s history, and our own experience." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Compatibilism: Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - Human choices are genuinely free in the sense of acting according to one’s desires.
    - God’s foreordination includes human decisions without violating moral responsibility.
    - Rejects libertarian free will as unbiblical and incoherent.
    - Affirms that God’s sovereignty establishes, rather than negates, meaningful choice.
    - "God’s control and our responsibility are not in competition but are mutually reinforcing." (No Other God)

4. **God’s Goodness and the Problem of Evil**
    - Evil is real and permitted by God for wise and ultimately good purposes.
    - God is never the author of sin, though He ordains all that comes to pass.
    - The existence of evil serves to display God’s justice, mercy, and glory.
    - The mystery of evil’s place in God’s plan is acknowledged but not resolved by appeal to human autonomy.
    - "God ordains evil for good reasons, though those reasons are often beyond our comprehension." (The Doctrine of God)

5. **Rejection of Open Theism and Process Thought**
    - Defends classical **omniscience** and **immutability** against contemporary revisions.
    - Critiques open theism for undermining biblical and confessional teaching on God’s knowledge.
    - Argues that God’s exhaustive foreknowledge is essential for Christian confidence and worship.
    - Maintains that God’s relationship to time is unique and not subject to creaturely limitations.
    - "Open theism diminishes God’s lordship by denying his exhaustive knowledge and control." (No Other God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **divine sovereignty**, providence, and the problem of evil, especially through his triperspectival method and accessible engagement with philosophical challenges. His work has provided pastors and theologians with tools to affirm both God’s exhaustive control and the meaningfulness of human action. Frame’s critiques of open theism and process theology have reinforced classical doctrines in evangelical circles, ensuring ongoing relevance for debates on God’s knowledge and providence.
