# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s approach to **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** is foundational for Western theology. He affirms that God’s **omniscience** and **sovereign will** encompass all events, yet God remains blameless for evil, which he defines as a privation of good rather than a substance. Augustine’s theodicy insists on the compatibility of **human free will** with divine providence, emphasizing the mystery of God’s governance over creation.

- "For He is not called omnipotent because He is able to do all things, but because He does what He wills." (City of God, V.10)

## Key Works

- City of God (De Civitate Dei)

- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- The Problem of Free Choice (De Libero Arbitrio)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Foreknowledge is Exhaustive**
    - God knows all things, past, present, and future, without temporal limitation.
    - Divine knowledge does not depend on created realities but is rooted in God’s eternal nature.
    - God’s foreknowledge includes all human actions, yet does not cause them.
    - There is no contradiction between God’s foreknowledge and human responsibility.
    - "God foreknows all things, but He does not predestine all things." (City of God, V.10)

2. **Providence Governs All Events**
    - God’s providence orders the universe toward His ultimate purposes.
    - Nothing happens apart from God’s sovereign will, including the actions of free creatures.
    - Providence is compatible with secondary causes and creaturely freedom.
    - God permits evil for the sake of greater goods and the manifestation of His justice and mercy.
    - "Nothing, therefore, happens unless the Omnipotent wills it to happen." (Enchiridion, 100)

3. **Evil as Privation, Not Substance**
    - Evil is not a created substance but a lack or corruption of good.
    - All that exists is good insofar as it exists; evil is parasitic on the good.
    - God is not the author of evil, since He creates only good.
    - The existence of evil serves to highlight the greater beauty and order of creation.
    - "For evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'" (City of God, XI.9)

4. **Human Free Will and Moral Responsibility**
    - Humans possess genuine free will, enabling moral responsibility.
    - Sin arises from the misuse of free will, not from God’s causation.
    - Divine foreknowledge does not coerce or override human choices.
    - Grace is necessary for the will to choose the good after the Fall.
    - "We are therefore by our own fault under the power of sin." (Enchiridion, 106)

5. **Theodicy: God’s Goodness and the Existence of Evil**
    - God permits evil to bring about a greater good or to display His justice and mercy.
    - The suffering of the righteous and the prosperity of the wicked are ultimately ordered to God’s wise ends.
    - The mystery of providence calls for humility and trust in God’s goodness.
    - Final judgment will reveal the full justice and purpose of God’s governance.
    - "God judged it better to bring good out of evil than not to permit any evil to exist." (Enchiridion, 11)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s synthesis of **divine sovereignty**, **foreknowledge**, and the **problem of evil** shaped the entire Western Christian tradition, influencing both medieval and Reformation thought. His articulation of evil as privation and his defense of human responsibility under divine providence remain central to Christian theodicy. Later theologians, including Aquinas and the Reformers, built upon Augustine’s framework, making his insights enduringly relevant for debates on providence and evil.
