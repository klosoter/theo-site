# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** from a robustly Reformed and biblical-theological perspective. He emphasized the absolute sovereignty of God over all things, including evil, while maintaining the genuine responsibility of human agents. Vos insisted that God's **decree** encompasses all events without making God the author of sin, and he saw the resolution of the problem of evil in the context of **redemptive history**.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Sovereignty of God**
    - God’s **providence** extends to every detail of creation, including evil acts.
    - Nothing occurs outside the scope of God’s **decree**.
    - Divine foreknowledge is grounded in God’s eternal purpose, not mere foresight.
    - God’s sovereignty is compatible with human responsibility.
    - "The decree of God is the plan according to which He governs all things." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 1)

2. **Distinction between Primary and Secondary Causes**
    - God ordains all things, but uses means (secondary causes) to accomplish His will.
    - Human actions are real and significant within God’s providential order.
    - Evil arises through secondary causes, not by direct divine causation.
    - This preserves God’s holiness while affirming His control over evil.
    - "God is not the author of sin, though He decrees and governs even sinful acts." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 1)

3. **Providence as Preservation, Concurrence, and Government**
    - Providence includes God’s preservation of creation, His concurrence with all actions, and His government over all events.
    - Concurrence means God works in and through all creaturely actions.
    - God’s government ensures the fulfillment of His redemptive purposes.
    - These aspects of providence are inseparable in Vos’s theology.
    - "Providence is the continued exercise of that same wisdom, power, and goodness which first brought the world into being." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 1)

4. **The Problem of Evil within Redemptive History**
    - The existence of evil is permitted for the greater manifestation of God’s glory.
    - Evil serves a purpose in the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - The cross of Christ is the ultimate demonstration of God’s sovereignty over evil.
    - Evil is never outside God’s control, but its resolution is eschatological.
    - "The problem of evil finds its answer only in the light of the cross and the consummation of redemption." ("Biblical Theology")

5. **Scripture as the Norm for Theodicy**
    - Vos insists that solutions to the problem of evil must be grounded in **biblical revelation**.
    - Philosophical theodicies are subordinate to the witness of Scripture.
    - The Bible presents both God’s sovereignty and human responsibility without contradiction.
    - The mystery of providence is to be received in faith, not fully explained.
    - "Revelation does not solve the problem of evil theoretically, but places it in the context of God’s redemptive work." ("Biblical Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **providence** and the problem of evil has shaped Reformed theology’s approach to divine sovereignty and human responsibility. His biblical-theological method influenced generations of theologians to interpret the problem of evil within the unfolding drama of redemption. Vos’s insistence on grounding theodicy in Scripture rather than speculative philosophy remains a hallmark of confessional Reformed thought. His legacy endures in the ongoing discussions of **divine foreknowledge** and the nature of evil in the context of God’s redemptive purposes.
