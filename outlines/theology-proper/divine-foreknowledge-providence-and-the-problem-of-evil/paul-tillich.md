# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** through his existential and ontological framework, emphasizing the dynamic relationship between **God’s being** and the world. He rejected classical theism’s static view of God, instead proposing that God is the **Ground of Being** who participates in history and human experience, allowing for genuine freedom and the reality of evil within the context of **divine creativity** and **meaning**.

- "God does not know the future as something already fixed, but as something which is created in the process of creative freedom." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as the Ground of Being**
    - God is not a being among beings but the very basis of all existence.
    - Divine knowledge is not external observation but participation in the depth of reality.
    - God’s relation to time is not temporal but eternal, transcending past, present, and future.
    - This ontological approach reframes foreknowledge as God’s intimate presence in all moments.
    - "God is being-itself, not a being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Providence as Creative Meaning**
    - Providence is not meticulous control but the ongoing creation of meaning in history.
    - Human freedom is preserved within the divine creativity that undergirds existence.
    - God’s providence is the power that resists nonbeing and chaos, sustaining order.
    - Evil is permitted as the risk inherent in the creative process.
    - "Providence is creative and not controlling." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **The Problem of Evil as Existential Estrangement**
    - Evil is not a substance but the distortion or privation of being.
    - Human estrangement from God is the root of existential anxiety and evil.
    - The reality of evil is inseparable from the freedom and risk of existence.
    - Redemption is the healing of estrangement, not the eradication of evil’s possibility.
    - "Evil is the manifestation of the self-destructive possibility of finite freedom." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom**
    - God’s knowledge of the future is not deterministic but open to genuine novelty.
    - Human actions are not predetermined, allowing for authentic moral responsibility.
    - Divine foreknowledge is compatible with freedom because it is grounded in God’s eternal perspective.
    - The future is a realm of potentiality, not fixed actuality, in Tillich’s thought.
    - "God knows the future as the future, not as the past." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Symbolic and Existential Language about God**
    - All theological language is symbolic, pointing beyond itself to the ultimate reality.
    - Doctrines of providence and foreknowledge must be interpreted existentially, not literally.
    - The problem of evil is addressed through symbols that express the depth of human experience.
    - Tillich’s method seeks to correlate existential questions with theological answers.
    - "Symbols participate in the reality to which they point." (Dynamics of Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential approach to **divine providence** and the **problem of evil** has profoundly influenced 20th-century theology, especially in the dialogue between theology and philosophy. His emphasis on **human freedom** and the symbolic nature of theological language challenged classical doctrines and opened new avenues for addressing the reality of suffering. While some critics argue that his views risk undermining traditional doctrines of omniscience and omnipotence, Tillich’s work remains a foundational resource for those seeking to reconcile Christian faith with the complexities of modern existence.
