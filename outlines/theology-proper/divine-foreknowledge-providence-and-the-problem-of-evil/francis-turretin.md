# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of **divine foreknowledge** and **providence** within a classical **Reformed scholastic** framework, emphasizing God's exhaustive knowledge and sovereign governance over all things, including evil. He maintained that God's **decree** is the ultimate ground of all events, yet he carefully distinguished between God's permission of evil and his causation of it, thereby upholding both divine sovereignty and human responsibility in addressing the **problem of evil**.

- "God foreknows and foreordains all things, yet so as not to be the author of sin." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- "Disputations on the Providence of God" (within Institutes)
- "Disputation on the Will of God" (within Institutes)

- Richard A. Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Comprehensive Divine Foreknowledge**
    - God possesses **infallible knowledge** of all things, actual and possible.
    - Divine foreknowledge is grounded in God's eternal **decree**.
    - God's knowledge is not dependent on creatures or contingent events.
    - Foreknowledge extends to free acts, yet does not violate creaturely freedom.
    - "God knows all things, not by conjecture, but by the certainty of his own decree." (Institutes)

2. **Meticulous Providence**
    - God's **providence** extends to all creation, sustaining and governing every event.
    - Providence includes both the preservation and concurrence of all things.
    - God orders even evil acts for wise and holy ends, without being morally implicated.
    - Secondary causes are real and significant within God's providential order.
    - "Nothing happens except by the will of God, yet God is not the author of sin." (Institutes)

3. **Distinction Between Decree and Execution**
    - The **decree** of God is eternal, simple, and unchangeable.
    - The execution of the decree occurs in time through means and secondary causes.
    - God's decree encompasses both good and evil, but in different modes (efficacious vs. permissive).
    - The distinction safeguards God's holiness and creaturely responsibility.
    - "God decrees the permission of sin, not its efficiency." (Institutes)

4. **Permission of Evil Without Causation**
    - God permits evil for wise, just, and holy reasons, but does not cause it efficiently.
    - The **problem of evil** is addressed by distinguishing between God's will of decree and precept.
    - Evil results from the free will of rational creatures, not from God's direct action.
    - God's permission is active and sovereign, not passive or indifferent.
    - "God is said to will sin permissively, not effectively." (Institutes)

5. **Human Responsibility and Divine Sovereignty**
    - Human actions are genuinely free and morally accountable within God's sovereign plan.
    - Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are compatible, not mutually exclusive.
    - God's providence does not coerce the will but orders it according to his purposes.
    - The mystery of concurrence is affirmed, not fully explained.
    - "The liberty of the will is not destroyed by the necessity of the event." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin's articulation of **divine providence** and the **problem of evil** became foundational for later Reformed theology, especially in the tradition of Westminster and Old Princeton. His careful distinctions between decree, permission, and causation shaped subsequent debates on the compatibility of divine sovereignty and human freedom. Turretin's influence persists in contemporary discussions of **theodicy** and the Reformed understanding of God's relationship to evil. His scholastic clarity continues to serve as a model for systematic engagement with these perennial theological issues.
