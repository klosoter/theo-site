# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann addresses **divine foreknowledge, providence, and the problem of evil** through the lens of **eschatological hope** and the theology of the **crucified God**. He reinterprets **providence** as God's participatory and redemptive engagement in history, emphasizing God's solidarity with human suffering and the promise of **future redemption** rather than meticulous control.

- "God weeps with us so that we may one day laugh with him." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- God in Creation (1985)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Knowledge is Relational and Open**
    - Divine foreknowledge is not deterministic but dynamically engaged with creation.
    - God’s knowledge includes all possibilities and actualities, respecting creaturely freedom.
    - The future is genuinely open, shaped by God’s promises and human response.
    - God’s foreknowledge is eschatologically oriented, focused on the fulfillment of hope.
    - "God does not foresee everything as already fixed, but as open to his creative possibilities." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Providence as Participatory and Redemptive**
    - Providence is God’s involvement in history, not mere control or predetermination.
    - God works within creation’s suffering, guiding it toward redemption.
    - Divine action is most clearly revealed in the cross and resurrection.
    - Providence is future-oriented, grounded in the promise of new creation.
    - "God’s providence is the power of his suffering love, which brings forth hope." (God in Creation)

3. **The Problem of Evil and Divine Suffering**
    - God is not the author of evil but suffers with creation in its pain.
    - The cross reveals God’s solidarity with victims and the depth of divine compassion.
    - Evil is opposed by God and will be overcome in the eschaton.
    - Theodicy is reframed as hope in God’s ultimate victory over suffering.
    - "Only a suffering God can help." (The Crucified God)

4. **Eschatological Resolution of Evil**
    - Evil is not explained away but confronted by the promise of future transformation.
    - God’s providence is vindicated in the resurrection and the coming kingdom.
    - The final answer to evil is found in the eschatological renewal of all things.
    - Hope sustains believers amid suffering, anticipating God’s ultimate justice.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new creation." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Trinitarian Engagement with the World**
    - The triune God is present and active in the world’s history and suffering.
    - The Spirit enables creation’s participation in God’s redemptive purposes.
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit are united in the work of liberation and renewal.
    - Trinitarian theology grounds God’s providence in relational love, not abstract power.
    - "The history of God is the history of his suffering and liberating love." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **theodicy**, divine providence, and eschatology, especially within the context of suffering and hope. His emphasis on the **crucified God** and the openness of the future has influenced liberation, feminist, and political theologies. By reframing providence as participatory and redemptive, Moltmann offers a compelling vision of God’s involvement with a suffering world, inspiring ongoing theological engagement with the problem of evil.
