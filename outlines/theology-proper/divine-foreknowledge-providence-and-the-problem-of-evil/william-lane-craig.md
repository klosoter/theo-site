# William Lane Craig (1949–)

William Lane Craig is a contemporary analytic philosopher and theologian who defends a **Molinist** account of **divine foreknowledge** and **providence**. He argues that God's knowledge of **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom** enables Him to sovereignly orchestrate history while preserving **human libertarian freedom** and offering a robust response to the **problem of evil**.

- "God knows what every free creature would do in any given circumstance and can sovereignly arrange the world accordingly." ("The Only Wise God")

## Key Works

- The Only Wise God: The Compatibility of Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom
- Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom: The Coherence of Theism: Omniscience
- Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview (with J.P. Moreland)
- Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics
- "Middle Knowledge, Truth–Makers, and the 'Grounding Objection'" (Faith and Philosophy)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Molinism and Middle Knowledge**
    - God possesses **middle knowledge**: knowledge of all true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.
    - This knowledge is logically prior to God's creative decree.
    - Middle knowledge allows God to actualize a world in which His purposes are achieved through genuinely free choices.
    - This framework preserves both **divine sovereignty** and **human freedom**.
    - "On Molinism, God’s providence and human freedom are compatible because God knows what free creatures would do in any circumstance." (The Only Wise God)

2. **Libertarian Free Will**
    - Human beings have genuine **libertarian freedom**—the ability to choose otherwise in any given situation.
    - Divine foreknowledge does not causally determine human choices.
    - God’s providential plan incorporates, but does not override, creaturely freedom.
    - This view rejects **theological determinism**.
    - "Foreknowledge does not entail determinism; it is logically compatible with libertarian freedom." (The Only Wise God)

3. **Providence as Sovereign and Personal**
    - God exercises meticulous **providence** over creation.
    - Through middle knowledge, God can ensure His will is accomplished without violating human freedom.
    - God’s providence is both universal and particular, extending to all events.
    - This model upholds God’s personal involvement in history.
    - "God’s providence is so exhaustive that nothing happens outside His will, yet He does not override creaturely freedom." (Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview)

4. **The Problem of Evil and Greater-Good Defense**
    - The existence of evil is compatible with an all-powerful, all-good God.
    - God permits evil to bring about greater goods or to achieve morally sufficient reasons.
    - Middle knowledge enables God to actualize a world with the optimal balance of good and free will.
    - The **free will defense** is central to Craig’s response to the logical and evidential problems of evil.
    - "God could have morally sufficient reasons for permitting the evil that exists, given the value of free will." (Reasonable Faith)

5. **Omniscience and Timelessness**
    - God’s **omniscience** includes knowledge of past, present, future, and counterfactual truths.
    - Craig defends a dynamic theory of time (presentism) but affirms God’s exhaustive foreknowledge.
    - God’s knowledge is not limited by temporal succession.
    - This view maintains both God’s transcendence and immanence.
    - "God’s knowledge encompasses all that is, was, will be, and would be under any circumstances." (Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom)

## Legacy and Impact

William Lane Craig has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** through his rigorous defense of Molinism. His work has revitalized interest in middle knowledge as a solution to longstanding theological dilemmas, especially among evangelical philosophers. Craig’s analytic clarity and public debates have made these complex issues accessible to a broader audience, influencing both academic and popular apologetics.
