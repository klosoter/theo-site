# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** through the lens of **God-consciousness** and the absolute dependence of creation on God. He rejected classical theism’s emphasis on meticulous sovereignty, instead positing that God’s relation to the world is mediated through the ongoing, dynamic process of **divine causality** that preserves both divine omniscience and human freedom. Schleiermacher’s approach sought to reconcile the existence of evil with God’s goodness by emphasizing the world’s unity in God’s redemptive purpose.

- "Every event, even the most minute, is so connected with the totality that it cannot be otherwise than it is." (The Christian Faith §54)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Foreknowledge as Comprehensive but Non-Deterministic**
    - God’s knowledge encompasses all events as a unified whole, not as a sequence of isolated facts.
    - Divine foreknowledge is grounded in God’s eternal will, not in temporal causality.
    - Human freedom is preserved because God’s knowledge does not necessitate coercion.
    - The future is known to God as part of the totality of creation, not as a set of predetermined outcomes.
    - "God knows all things as they are in their connection with the whole." (The Christian Faith §54)

2. **Providence as the Divine Causality of the World-Whole**
    - Providence is the ongoing, sustaining activity of God in the world’s unity.
    - God’s providence is not interventionist but is expressed in the totality of natural and historical processes.
    - Every event is part of the divine plan, but not in a mechanistic or fatalistic sense.
    - The world’s order reflects God’s purpose, even amid apparent disorder.
    - "Providence is nothing other than the divine causality itself, as it is exercised in the world-whole." (The Christian Faith §55)

3. **The Problem of Evil as a Necessary Aspect of Finite Existence**
    - Evil arises from the limitations inherent in finite beings, not from a defect in God’s will.
    - The existence of evil is inseparable from the conditions that make moral development possible.
    - Evil is understood as disharmony within the created order, not as a substance or independent force.
    - The presence of evil serves the greater unity and purpose of the world in God.
    - "Evil is only the necessary shadow of the good in a world of finite beings." (The Christian Faith §80)

4. **Human Freedom within Divine Sovereignty**
    - Human actions are genuinely free within the context of God’s comprehensive causality.
    - Divine sovereignty is not competitive with creaturely freedom but enables it.
    - The relationship between God and the world is one of mutual participation, not unilateral control.
    - Human responsibility is real, even as all things are encompassed in God’s will.
    - "The divine causality does not exclude, but rather includes, the causality of the creature." (The Christian Faith §55)

5. **Redemptive Purpose and the Unity of History**
    - History is the unfolding of God’s redemptive purpose for humanity and creation.
    - The unity of the world is ultimately oriented toward the realization of the kingdom of God.
    - Suffering and evil are integrated into the divine plan as means to a greater good.
    - The consummation of history will reveal the coherence of providence and the resolution of evil.
    - "The world is a system whose unity is grounded in the divine will and whose goal is the kingdom of God." (The Christian Faith §119)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reconfiguration of **providence** and the **problem of evil** profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the development of liberal Protestant thought. His emphasis on the unity of divine action and human freedom challenged classical doctrines and paved the way for later existential and process theologies. While his solutions to the problem of evil remain debated, his focus on the world’s unity in God continues to shape discussions of divine sovereignty and theodicy. Schleiermacher’s legacy endures in the ongoing quest to articulate a coherent and credible doctrine of God in the face of evil.
