# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **divine foreknowledge** and **providence**, affirming God's exhaustive knowledge of all things and His sovereign governance over creation. They address the **problem of evil** by upholding God's holiness and wisdom, maintaining that God ordains whatsoever comes to pass while not being the author of sin. The Standards emphasize the compatibility of divine sovereignty with human responsibility, grounding their teaching in the overarching framework of **Reformed orthodoxy**.

- "God from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy counsel of his own will, freely, and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass: yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures." (Westminster Confession of Faith 3.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 3, 5, and 9)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 12–19)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 7–11)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (as appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Divine Foreknowledge**
    - God knows all things, actual and possible, from eternity.
    - His knowledge is not contingent upon creation or human actions.
    - Divine foreknowledge is comprehensive and infallible.
    - This knowledge is rooted in God's eternal decree.
    - "God’s knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature." (WCF 2.2)

2. **Sovereign Providence**
    - God upholds, directs, disposes, and governs all creatures and actions.
    - Providence extends to the smallest details, yet preserves secondary causes.
    - God’s providence is wise, holy, and for His own glory.
    - Nothing happens by chance but by God’s fatherly hand.
    - "God the great Creator of all things doth uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, actions, and things, from the greatest even to the least." (WCF 5.1)

3. **God Not the Author of Sin**
    - God ordains all things but is not morally responsible for evil.
    - The Standards distinguish between God’s decree and the agency of creatures.
    - Human sin arises from the will of the creature, not from God’s nature.
    - God’s permission of evil serves His wise and holy purposes.
    - "Yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures." (WCF 3.1)

4. **Compatibilism: Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - Human choices are real and significant within God’s sovereign plan.
    - God’s providence does not destroy the liberty or contingency of second causes.
    - The will of the creature is neither forced nor predetermined by necessity.
    - Moral responsibility is preserved under divine ordination.
    - "Nor is the liberty or contingency of second causes taken away, but rather established." (WCF 3.1)

5. **Purposeful Ordination of Evil**
    - God permits evil for wise, just, and holy ends.
    - Evil is used by God to display His justice, mercy, and power.
    - The ultimate purpose of permitting evil is the manifestation of God’s glory.
    - God overrules evil for the good of His people and the accomplishment of His will.
    - "Yet so, as the sinfulness thereof proceedeth only from the creature, and not from God." (WCF 5.4)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on divine foreknowledge, providence, and the problem of evil, providing a systematic and nuanced framework that balances God’s sovereignty with human responsibility. Their careful distinctions have influenced confessional traditions, theological education, and debates on theodicy. The Standards remain a touchstone for discussions of **divine providence** and the nature of evil within the broader Christian tradition. Their articulation continues to guide pastors, theologians, and churches in addressing the complexities of God’s relationship to a fallen world.
