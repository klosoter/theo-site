# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner addressed **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** by emphasizing the relational and personal nature of God’s sovereignty. He rejected deterministic accounts, insisting on the reality of **human freedom** and the mystery of evil within God’s providential governance. Brunner maintained that God’s knowledge and rule are not mechanistic but are exercised in dynamic relationship with creation.

- "God does not will evil, but He permits it, and in His providence, He overrules it for His purposes." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. I)
- Man in Revolt
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter
- Revelation and Reason

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Providence as Personal and Relational**
    - God’s providence is not impersonal causality but a personal engagement with creation.
    - Divine governance respects the reality of creaturely freedom.
    - Providence is exercised in love, not in deterministic necessity.
    - God’s rule is dynamic, involving genuine interaction with human history.
    - "Providence is the rule of the living God, not the operation of a cosmic mechanism." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom**
    - God’s foreknowledge is comprehensive but does not negate human responsibility.
    - Brunner rejects both fatalism and open theism, affirming a paradoxical relationship.
    - Human decisions are real and significant within God’s sovereign plan.
    - God’s knowledge is not abstract but rooted in personal relationship.
    - "God knows all things, but His knowledge does not destroy the freedom of the creature." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

3. **The Problem of Evil as Mystery**
    - Evil is a profound mystery that cannot be fully explained by theology.
    - Brunner denies that evil is part of God’s creative will.
    - The existence of evil is tolerated, not authored, by God.
    - Theodicy is ultimately unsatisfactory; faith must accept the limits of reason.
    - "The question of evil is the darkest mystery of existence, and faith alone can endure it." (Man in Revolt)

4. **Rejection of Determinism**
    - Brunner opposes any view that reduces human beings to mere instruments.
    - He critiques Calvinistic double predestination as incompatible with God’s love.
    - Divine sovereignty does not entail causal determinism.
    - The relationship between God and humanity is dialogical, not monological.
    - "God’s sovereignty is not that of a tyrant, but of a Father who seeks fellowship." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

5. **Christocentric Resolution of Evil**
    - The ultimate answer to evil is found in the person and work of Christ.
    - The cross demonstrates both God’s opposition to evil and His redemptive purpose.
    - Suffering and evil are taken up into God’s saving plan through Christ.
    - The resurrection is the pledge of evil’s final defeat.
    - "In Christ, God Himself enters into the suffering of the world and overcomes it." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **providence** and the **problem of evil** influenced 20th-century theology by emphasizing the personal and relational character of God’s sovereignty. His insistence on the mystery of evil and the reality of human freedom provided a mediating position between strict determinism and process theology. Brunner’s thought continues to shape discussions on divine action, theodicy, and the nature of God’s knowledge in contemporary theology.
