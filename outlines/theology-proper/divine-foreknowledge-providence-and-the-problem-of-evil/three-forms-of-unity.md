# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed** doctrine of **divine providence** and **foreknowledge**, affirming that God sovereignly ordains all things, including the existence of **evil**, while remaining perfectly holy and just. These confessions uphold both God's meticulous providence and human responsibility, addressing the problem of evil by emphasizing the mystery of God's will and the comfort believers find in His fatherly governance.

- "Nothing happens in this world without His appointment." (Belgic Confession, Art. 13)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Articles 13 ("The Providence of God") and 14 ("The Creation and Fall of Man")
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Day 10 (Q&A 27–28)
- Canons of Dort, First Head of Doctrine, Articles 6, 15–18
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard English editions)
- Lyle D. Bierma, "The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereign Providence**
    - God upholds, governs, and directs all creatures and events by His almighty and ever-present power.
    - Providence extends to both great and small matters, leaving nothing to chance.
    - God’s governance is described as “fatherly,” providing comfort to believers amid suffering and evil.
    - Human affairs, including evil acts, are within God’s decree but do not implicate Him in sin.
    "We believe that this good God, after He had created all things, did not forsake them to chance or fortune, but leads and governs them according to His holy will." (Belgic Confession, Art. 13)

2. **Divine Foreknowledge and Decree**
    - God’s knowledge is exhaustive, eternal, and not dependent on creaturely actions.
    - The divine decree encompasses all things, including the fall and its consequences.
    - God’s foreknowledge is not passive foresight but active ordination.
    - The Canons of Dort explicitly reject the notion that God’s decree is based on foreseen faith or works.
    "For nothing can be in man that was not decreed by God’s eternal counsel." (Canons of Dort, I.10)

3. **Human Responsibility and the Problem of Evil**
    - Humans are responsible for their sin and cannot blame God for evil.
    - The confessions maintain a distinction between God’s will of decree and His will of command.
    - The origin of evil is traced to the free, voluntary fall of man, not to God’s creative act.
    - God’s providence uses even evil acts for His good purposes without being the author of sin.
    "Yet God neither is the author of, nor can be charged with, the sin which occurs." (Canons of Dort, I.15)

4. **The Mystery of Providence**
    - The confessions acknowledge the limits of human understanding regarding God’s ways.
    - Believers are exhorted to trust God’s wisdom even when providence is inscrutable.
    - The problem of evil is ultimately a mystery, yet not a contradiction in God’s character.
    - The confessions warn against “curious searching” into God’s secret will.
    "We do not wish to inquire with undue curiosity into what He does that surpasses human understanding." (Belgic Confession, Art. 13)

5. **Pastoral Comfort in Providence**
    - God’s providence is a source of assurance and comfort for believers.
    - The Heidelberg Catechism emphasizes that all things must work together for the believer’s good.
    - Even suffering and evil are under God’s fatherly hand, leading to patient endurance and hope.
    - The confessions encourage gratitude and confidence in God’s care, even amid adversity.
    "All things, in fact, come to us not by chance but from His fatherly hand." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 27)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology’s approach to **divine providence**, foreknowledge, and the problem of evil, providing a confessional anchor for generations of churches. Their careful balance of God’s sovereignty and human responsibility has influenced subsequent confessional documents and theological discourse. The pastoral emphasis on comfort amid suffering continues to resonate in Reformed communities, offering a distinctive response to the enduring challenge of evil in a world governed by a sovereign and good God.
