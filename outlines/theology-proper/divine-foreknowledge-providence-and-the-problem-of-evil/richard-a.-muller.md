# Richard Muller (1948–)

Richard Muller is a leading historian of **Reformed orthodoxy**, emphasizing the continuity and development of doctrines such as **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** from the Reformation through post-Reformation scholasticism. He argues that early modern Reformed theologians maintained a robust doctrine of **God’s sovereignty** while carefully distinguishing between **God’s will** and the existence of evil, employing scholastic distinctions to uphold both divine providence and human responsibility.

- "The Reformed orthodox maintained a sophisticated doctrine of providence that affirmed both divine sovereignty and the reality of secondary causes." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: The Divine Essence and Attributes
- After Calvin: Studies in the Development of a Theological Tradition
- Divine Will and Human Choice: Freedom, Contingency, and Necessity in Early Modern Reformed Thought
- "The Problem of Evil in Reformed Orthodoxy" (in The Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology)
- Christ and the Decree: Christology and Predestination in Reformed Theology from Calvin to Perkins

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Foreknowledge is Comprehensive and Immutable**
   - God’s knowledge encompasses all things, including future contingents and free acts.
   - Reformed orthodox theologians distinguish between **necessity of consequence** and **necessity of the consequent** to preserve contingency.
   - Divine foreknowledge does not cause events but infallibly knows them as they will occur.
   - The distinction between **God’s knowledge of simple intelligence** (all possibilities) and **knowledge of vision** (actualities) is maintained.
   - "God knows all things, not because they will be, but because he wills them to be." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

2. **Providence Upholds Secondary Causality**
   - God’s providence operates through **secondary causes**, preserving genuine creaturely action.
   - Early Reformed thought rejects occasionalism, affirming that God concurs with, but does not override, created agents.
   - The doctrine of **concursus** explains how God’s will and creaturely freedom coexist.
   - Providence is both **conserving** (preserving creation) and **governing** (directing all things to their ends).
   - "The Reformed orthodox consistently argued for a concurrence of divine and created causality." (After Calvin)

3. **Distinction Between God’s Will and Permission of Evil**
   - God’s **decretive will** ordains all things, but evil is permitted rather than directly caused.
   - The concept of **permission** is used to explain how God remains sovereign without being the author of sin.
   - Evil is understood as a privation, not a substance, preserving God’s goodness.
   - The distinction between **antecedent** and **consequent will** is employed to clarify God’s relationship to evil.
   - "God’s permission of evil is not a passive allowance but a sovereign ordination that does not compromise divine holiness." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

4. **Theodicy and the Problem of Evil**
   - Reformed orthodoxy addresses the problem of evil by affirming God’s justice and inscrutability.
   - The ultimate reasons for God’s allowance of evil are often deemed **mysterious** and beyond human comprehension.
   - Theodicy is grounded in the distinction between **God’s revealed will** and **hidden will**.
   - Human responsibility for evil is maintained alongside divine sovereignty.
   - "The Reformed tradition does not offer a rationalistic theodicy but points to the mystery of God’s will." (The Problem of Evil in Reformed Orthodoxy)

5. **Continuity and Development in Reformed Thought**
   - Muller emphasizes the continuity from Calvin to later Reformed scholastics on these doctrines.
   - He rejects the caricature of a deterministic or voluntarist shift in post-Reformation theology.
   - The use of scholastic distinctions serves to clarify, not undermine, Reformed commitments to **providence** and **human freedom**.
   - Historical context is essential for understanding doctrinal formulations on foreknowledge and evil.
   - "The Reformed orthodox did not abandon Calvin’s theology but developed it with greater precision." (After Calvin)

## Legacy and Impact

Muller’s scholarship has profoundly shaped the understanding of **Reformed scholasticism**, correcting misconceptions about determinism and the doctrine of providence. His work has highlighted the nuanced distinctions employed by early modern theologians to uphold both **divine sovereignty** and human responsibility in the face of evil. By recovering the scholastic context, Muller has influenced both historical theology and contemporary discussions on the **problem of evil** within the Reformed tradition.
