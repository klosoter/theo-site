# Alvin Plantinga (1932–)

Alvin Plantinga is a leading analytic philosopher whose work on **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** has profoundly shaped contemporary philosophy of religion. He is best known for articulating the **Free Will Defense**, which argues that the existence of evil is logically compatible with the existence of an **omniscient**, **omnipotent**, and **omnibenevolent** God. Plantinga’s approach emphasizes the coherence of **theistic belief** in the face of logical and evidential challenges posed by evil.

- "A world containing creatures who are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all." ("God, Freedom, and Evil")

## Key Works

- God, Freedom, and Evil (1974)
- The Nature of Necessity (1974)
- "Self-Profile" in Alvin Plantinga (ed. Tomberlin and van Inwagen, 1985)
- "On Ockham’s Way Out" (Faith and Philosophy, 1986)
- "The Free Will Defense" (in The Problem of Evil, ed. Adams and Adams, 1990)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Free Will Defense against Logical Problem of Evil**
    - Argues that the existence of **significantly free creatures** is a great good.
    - Maintains that even an **omnipotent God** cannot create free creatures who always choose good.
    - Asserts that the logical problem of evil fails to demonstrate an inconsistency between God and evil.
    - Emphasizes the possibility that every creaturely essence suffers from **transworld depravity**.
    - "It is possible that God, even being omnipotent, could not have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil." (God, Freedom, and Evil)

2. **Middle Knowledge and Divine Foreknowledge**
    - Engages critically with **Molinism** and the concept of God’s knowledge of counterfactuals.
    - Argues that God’s foreknowledge does not compromise human freedom.
    - Suggests that God’s providence is compatible with libertarian free will.
    - Explores the coherence of God’s knowing future contingents.
    - "God’s foreknowledge is not in conflict with human freedom, for knowing what someone will freely do does not cause them to do it." (The Nature of Necessity)

3. **Transworld Depravity**
    - Introduces the idea that every possible person might go wrong in any feasible world.
    - Uses this concept to explain why God might permit evil even if omnipotent.
    - Undermines the claim that God could actualize any possible world He wishes.
    - Provides a possible explanation for the presence of evil in all worlds with free creatures.
    - "It is possible that every essence suffers from transworld depravity." (God, Freedom, and Evil)

4. **God’s Providence and Sovereignty**
    - Affirms that God is **sovereign** over creation while allowing genuine creaturely freedom.
    - Holds that God can bring about His purposes even through free actions.
    - Rejects deterministic accounts that undermine moral responsibility.
    - Emphasizes the compatibility of providence with contingency in creation.
    - "God can create free creatures and still accomplish His purposes through their free actions." (God, Freedom, and Evil)

5. **The Evidential Problem of Evil**
    - Distinguishes between the logical and evidential problems of evil.
    - Argues that the existence of evil does not make theism irrational or unjustified.
    - Develops **reformed epistemology** to defend rational belief in God despite evil.
    - Suggests that God may have morally sufficient reasons for permitting evil, even if unknown to us.
    - "The fact that we cannot see a reason for evil does not mean that God does not have one." (God, Freedom, and Evil)

## Legacy and Impact

Plantinga’s work has reshaped the philosophical landscape regarding the **problem of evil**, making the logical argument against theism largely obsolete in analytic philosophy. His **Free Will Defense** is now a standard reference point in discussions of divine providence and human freedom. Plantinga’s influence extends to debates on **divine foreknowledge**, the coherence of theism, and the rationality of religious belief, ensuring his continued relevance in both philosophy and systematic theology.
