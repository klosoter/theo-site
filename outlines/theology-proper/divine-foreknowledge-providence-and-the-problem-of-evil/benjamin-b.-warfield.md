# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated a robust doctrine of **divine foreknowledge** and **providence** grounded in the absolute sovereignty of God, insisting that all events—including evil—unfold according to God's eternal plan. He maintained that God's **omniscience** and **omnipotence** are fully compatible with human responsibility, and he addressed the **problem of evil** by emphasizing the inscrutability of God's purposes and the ultimate good achieved through God's providential governance.

- "A God who could create a world which He did not control would be a God subject to the world, and therefore not God." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Divine Sovereignty**
   - God ordains whatsoever comes to pass, including all events in history.
   - Divine sovereignty is the foundation for understanding providence and foreknowledge.
   - No event, including evil, falls outside God's eternal decree.
   - Human freedom operates within the bounds of God's sovereign will.
   - "There is no such thing in the universe as an event out of relation to the divine will." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

2. **Comprehensive Divine Foreknowledge**
   - God's knowledge encompasses all things actual and possible.
   - Foreknowledge is not passive observation but rooted in God's decree.
   - There is no conflict between God's foreknowledge and human responsibility.
   - The certainty of future events is grounded in God's eternal purpose.
   - "God foreknows what will be because He has decreed what shall be." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

3. **Providence as Preservation and Government**
   - Providence includes both sustaining creation and governing its course.
   - God actively upholds and directs all creatures and actions.
   - Providence is meticulous, not merely general or permissive.
   - Even evil acts are within the scope of God's providential ordering.
   - "God's providence is not a mere permission, but a positive control." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

4. **Theodicy and the Problem of Evil**
   - The existence of evil is compatible with God's goodness and sovereignty.
   - Evil is used by God to accomplish greater purposes, often beyond human comprehension.
   - The ultimate resolution of evil is found in redemption through Christ.
   - Human inability to fully explain evil does not undermine faith in God's character.
   - "The mystery of evil is not solved by denying God's control, but by trusting His wisdom." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

5. **Compatibilism: Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
   - Human actions are genuinely free, yet ordained by God.
   - Moral accountability is preserved within God's sovereign plan.
   - Scripture affirms both divine causality and human agency.
   - Warfield rejects any notion that divine sovereignty negates human responsibility.
   - "The Scriptures teach both the absolute sovereignty of God and the real responsibility of man." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield's articulation of **divine providence** and foreknowledge has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in its engagement with modern challenges to the doctrine of God. His rigorous defense of God's sovereignty and his nuanced approach to the problem of evil continue to influence evangelical and confessional discussions. Warfield's legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of God's meticulous providence and the compatibility of divine sovereignty with human responsibility.
