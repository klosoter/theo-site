# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a robust doctrine of **divine foreknowledge** and **providence** rooted in the classical understanding of God’s **simplicity**, **omniscience**, and **sovereignty**. He maintained that God’s knowledge encompasses all things—past, present, and future—without compromising human **free will**, and he addressed the **problem of evil** by distinguishing between God’s permissive and ordaining will.

- "God therefore is the cause of things by His knowledge: inasmuch as His knowledge is to all things as art to things made by art." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.14, Art.8)

## Key Works

- Brian Davies, The Thought of Thomas Aquinas

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s knowledge is eternal and comprehensive**
    - God knows all things in a single, timeless act.
    - Divine knowledge includes all contingent events and free actions.
    - God’s knowledge is the cause of things, not merely passive awareness.
    - There is no succession or change in God’s knowing.
    - "God sees all things together and not successively." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.14, Art.13)

2. **Providence as God’s wise ordering of creation**
    - Providence is God’s plan by which all things are directed to their end.
    - God’s providence encompasses both necessary and contingent events.
    - Secondary causes are genuinely operative under God’s providence.
    - Providence does not negate creaturely freedom or contingency.
    - "Divine providence does not destroy contingency in things, but rather is the cause of it." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.22, Art.4)

3. **Distinction between God’s will and permission regarding evil**
    - God is not the author of evil but permits it for greater good.
    - Evil is a privation, not a positive substance.
    - God’s will ordains good; He permits evil only insofar as it serves His providential plan.
    - The permission of evil is compatible with divine goodness and omnipotence.
    - "God is in no way, directly or indirectly, the cause of sin." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.79, Art.1)

4. **Human free will under divine foreknowledge**
    - God’s foreknowledge does not impose necessity on human choices.
    - Free will is preserved within the scope of divine omniscience.
    - God moves the will as the universal cause, yet creatures act freely.
    - The compatibility of divine causality and free will is a mystery, not a contradiction.
    - "God’s knowledge does not impose necessity on things known." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.14, Art.13)

5. **Theodicy: God brings good out of evil**
    - God allows evil to exist to bring about a greater good.
    - The existence of evil highlights the perfection and order of the universe.
    - Evil serves as a means for the manifestation of divine justice and mercy.
    - The ultimate resolution of evil is found in the final ordering of all things to God.
    - "God allows evils to happen in order to bring a greater good therefrom." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.2, Art.3, ad 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **divine providence** and human freedom remains foundational in both Roman Catholic and broader Christian theology. His nuanced distinctions regarding **foreknowledge**, **secondary causality**, and the **problem of evil** have shaped centuries of philosophical and theological reflection. Later thinkers, both scholastic and Reformed, have engaged deeply with his arguments, either building upon or critically revising his positions. His influence endures in contemporary discussions on the compatibility of divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
