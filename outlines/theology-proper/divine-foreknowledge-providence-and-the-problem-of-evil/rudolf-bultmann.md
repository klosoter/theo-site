# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** through the lens of existential interpretation and demythologization. He rejected traditional metaphysical frameworks, emphasizing the **kerygma** and the individual's encounter with God in faith rather than speculative doctrines about God's relation to history or evil. For Bultmann, the meaning of providence and evil is found in the existential decision of faith, not in theoretical explanations.

- "God’s action is not to be understood as an intervention in the natural course of things, but as the eschatological event in which man is called to decision." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Providence**
   - Interprets biblical accounts of providence as existential symbols rather than literal interventions.
   - Rejects a supernaturalist worldview in favor of existential meaning.
   - Views providence as God’s call to authentic existence, not as control over historical events.
   - Emphasizes the proclamation (kerygma) over metaphysical speculation.
   - "The mythological conception of the world is untenable for modern man." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Understanding of Divine Foreknowledge**
   - Foreknowledge is not about God's exhaustive knowledge of future events.
   - Focuses on the individual's encounter with God in the present moment.
   - Stresses the existential decision rather than predestined outcomes.
   - Sees foreknowledge as a relational, not deterministic, category.
   - "Faith does not ask for proofs, nor does it seek to establish certainty by means of objective knowledge." (Faith and Understanding)

3. **Rejection of Theodicy as a Theoretical Problem**
   - Denies the possibility of a rational solution to the problem of evil.
   - Evil is experienced existentially, not explained metaphysically.
   - The cross confronts humans with the reality of evil and the call to decision.
   - The problem of evil is inseparable from the question of authentic existence.
   - "The question of theodicy is not a theoretical but an existential one." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
   - The proclamation of Christ is the locus of God’s action, not historical causality.
   - Providence and evil are interpreted through the event of proclamation.
   - The kerygma calls individuals to decision amid suffering and ambiguity.
   - The meaning of history is disclosed only in faith, not in providential schemata.
   - "It is only in the word of proclamation that the event of salvation becomes actual for us." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Faith as Response to Ambiguity**
   - Faith does not resolve the ambiguity of evil or providence.
   - Calls for authentic existence in the face of uncertainty and suffering.
   - Trust in God is an existential act, not a rational deduction from history.
   - The believer lives in hope, not in possession of metaphysical answers.
   - "Faith means openness to the future, readiness for decision, and acceptance of responsibility." (History and Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **providence** and the **problem of evil** deeply influenced twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **hermeneutics** and New Testament studies. His rejection of metaphysical theodicy and emphasis on existential decision shifted the focus from speculative doctrines to the lived reality of faith. While controversial among more traditional theologians, Bultmann’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the meaning of divine action and evil in a modern, post-Enlightenment context. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relevance of Christian proclamation in a secular age.
