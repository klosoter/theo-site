# Bruce K. Waltke (1930– )

Bruce K. Waltke approaches **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** through a robustly biblical and Reformed lens, emphasizing God's sovereign governance over creation while upholding human responsibility. He affirms that God’s **omniscience** and **omnipotence** are foundational to understanding how evil can exist without compromising God's goodness or control. Waltke’s exegesis of the Old Testament, especially in wisdom literature, highlights the mystery of **theodicy** and the ultimate trustworthiness of God’s purposes.

- "God’s sovereignty is comprehensive, but it does not violate the moral responsibility of his creatures." (An Old Testament Theology)

- Genesis: A Commentary
- "The Problem of Evil in the Old Testament" (in various lectures and essays)

    - Divine providence encompasses both the macro and micro events of history.
    - God’s rule is depicted throughout the Old Testament narrative and wisdom literature.
    - Human actions are real and significant, but never outside God’s sovereign plan.
    - "God’s sovereignty is not mitigated by the existence of evil, but evil is bounded and used for his purposes." (An Old Testament Theology)

2. **Divine Foreknowledge is Exhaustive**
    - God knows all things past, present, and future, including contingent events.
    - Prophetic literature demonstrates God’s knowledge of future free actions.
    - God’s foreknowledge is not passive but active, grounded in his decree.
    - There is no tension between God’s knowledge and human freedom in the biblical witness.
    - "The Lord’s knowledge of the future is comprehensive and certain, as seen in his prophetic word." (An Old Testament Theology)

3. **Providence Works Through Ordinary and Extraordinary Means**
    - God uses both natural processes and miraculous interventions to accomplish his will.
    - The wisdom literature emphasizes God’s providential ordering of daily life.
    - Providence is often hidden, requiring faith in God’s unseen hand.
    - God’s care extends to both Israel and the nations, showing universal providence.
    - "God’s providence is at work in the mundane as well as the miraculous." (Proverbs Commentary)

4. **The Problem of Evil is Addressed Theologically and Pastorally**
    - Evil is a real and tragic aspect of the fallen world, not created by God but permitted.
    - The Old Testament wrestles honestly with suffering (e.g., Job, Psalms).
    - God’s purposes in allowing evil are often inscrutable but ultimately redemptive.
    - The believer is called to trust God’s wisdom and justice amid suffering.
    - "The Old Testament does not shrink from the problem of evil but calls for faith in God’s ultimate justice." (An Old Testament Theology)

5. **Human Responsibility is Maintained Within Divine Sovereignty**
    - Humans are morally accountable for their choices, even under God’s providence.
    - The biblical narrative affirms both divine control and genuine human agency.
    - Wisdom literature exhorts ethical living in light of God’s governance.
    - Divine judgment presupposes real responsibility for evil actions.
    - "The tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility is not resolved philosophically but affirmed biblically." (Genesis Commentary)

## Legacy and Impact

Waltke’s work has significantly shaped evangelical understanding of **providence** and the **problem of evil** by grounding these doctrines in careful Old Testament exegesis. His emphasis on the interplay between God’s sovereignty and human responsibility has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to suffering. Waltke’s exegetical rigor and theological depth continue to inform discussions on the nature of evil and the trustworthiness of God’s governance in Reformed and evangelical circles.
