# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a robust doctrine of **divine foreknowledge** and **providence** within the framework of **Reformed orthodoxy**, emphasizing God's meticulous sovereignty over all events while maintaining human responsibility. He addressed the **problem of evil** by upholding God's holiness and wisdom, asserting that evil is permitted for wise and holy ends, though its ultimate rationale may remain mysterious to finite minds.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Divine Foreknowledge**
    - God possesses exhaustive and infallible knowledge of all things, past, present, and future.
    - Divine foreknowledge is grounded in God's eternal decree, not contingent on creaturely actions.
    - Hodge rejects any limitation of God's knowledge, including open theism or Socinian views.
    - Foreknowledge does not compromise human responsibility, as God's knowledge is not causative.
    - "The knowledge of God is not dependent upon the event, but the event is dependent upon the knowledge and purpose of God." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Meticulous Providence**
    - God governs all things, from the greatest to the least, by His wise and holy will.
    - Providence includes both preservation and government of creation.
    - Secondary causes are real, but always subordinate to the primary cause—God Himself.
    - Hodge affirms concurrence: God works through means without violating the nature of creatures.
    - "God is everywhere present, and everywhere active, controlling all events, great and small." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Compatibilism and Human Responsibility**
    - Divine sovereignty and human freedom are compatible, not mutually exclusive.
    - Human actions are truly voluntary, though foreordained by God.
    - Moral accountability is preserved because God's decree does not coerce the will.
    - Hodge rejects both fatalism and Pelagianism, maintaining the balance of Scripture.
    - "The Bible teaches that the free acts of men are foreordained, but that they are nevertheless free." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Theodicy: God’s Holiness and the Problem of Evil**
    - God is not the author of sin; He permits evil for wise and holy purposes.
    - The existence of evil is a profound mystery, but does not impugn God's goodness or sovereignty.
    - Evil is overruled for greater good, ultimately displaying God's justice and mercy.
    - Hodge appeals to the limits of human understanding regarding God's ultimate purposes.
    - "The permission of sin is a mystery, but the fact that God overrules it for good is the constant teaching of Scripture." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Doctrine**
    - All doctrines of foreknowledge, providence, and evil must be grounded in the authority of Scripture.
    - Hodge insists on the perspicuity and sufficiency of the Bible for theological formulation.
    - He critiques speculative philosophy that departs from biblical revelation.
    - The Reformed confessions serve as faithful summaries of scriptural teaching.
    - "The Scriptures everywhere teach that God foreordains whatsoever comes to pass." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **divine providence** and foreknowledge became a standard reference in American Reformed theology, shaping generations of pastors and theologians at Princeton and beyond. His careful balance of God's sovereignty with human responsibility influenced later discussions on the problem of evil and the nature of freedom. Hodge’s work continues to be cited for its clarity, biblical fidelity, and defense of classical theism against modern challenges.
