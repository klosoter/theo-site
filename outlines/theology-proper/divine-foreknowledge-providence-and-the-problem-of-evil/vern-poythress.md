# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** from a robustly Reformed and Trinitarian perspective, emphasizing God's exhaustive sovereignty and the coherence of His purposes. He insists that God's knowledge and control are comprehensive, yet compatible with genuine human responsibility, and that evil is encompassed within God's wise and good plan without implicating Him in moral wrongdoing. Poythress frequently employs **multiperspectivalism** to clarify the relationship between God's sovereignty and the reality of evil in the world.

- "God’s plan is comprehensive, including even evil, but God is not the author of evil." (Redeeming Science, p. 22)

## Key Works

- Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach (2006)
- The Mystery of the Trinity (2020)
- Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology (1987)
- Logic: A God-Centered Approach to the Foundation of Western Thought (2013)
- Chance and the Sovereignty of God: A God-Centered Approach to Probability and Random Events (2014)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s exhaustive foreknowledge and sovereignty**
    - God knows all things, including future contingencies, with absolute certainty.
    - Divine foreknowledge is rooted in God’s eternal decree.
    - Nothing occurs outside of God’s sovereign will, including evil events.
    - Human history unfolds according to God’s comprehensive plan.
    - "God’s knowledge is comprehensive and includes all possibilities and actualities." (Redeeming Science, p. 21)

2. **Multiperspectival approach to providence**
    - Theological issues are best understood through multiple, complementary perspectives.
    - Providence is viewed through God’s control, authority, and presence.
    - This approach helps reconcile divine sovereignty with human responsibility.
    - Multiperspectivalism guards against reductionism in addressing the problem of evil.
    - "We need to look at providence from several perspectives to appreciate its depth." (Symphonic Theology, p. 49)

3. **Affirmation of secondary causation**
    - God ordains not only ends but also means, including creaturely actions.
    - Secondary causes are real and significant within God’s providential order.
    - Human choices are genuine, though ultimately encompassed by God’s decree.
    - This commitment preserves both divine sovereignty and creaturely agency.
    - "God works through secondary causes, not in spite of them." (Redeeming Science, p. 23)

4. **God’s goodness and the inscrutability of evil**
    - God remains perfectly good even as He ordains that evil exists for wise purposes.
    - The ultimate reasons for evil are often beyond human comprehension.
    - The cross of Christ is central to understanding God’s response to evil.
    - Christians are called to trust God’s character amid suffering and mystery.
    - "The problem of evil is ultimately a mystery, but not an irrational one." (Chance and the Sovereignty of God, p. 151)

5. **Integration of biblical theology and philosophy**
    - Scripture is the ultimate authority for understanding providence and evil.
    - Philosophical reasoning is valuable but must be subordinate to biblical revelation.
    - Theological reflection must be shaped by the narrative and categories of Scripture.
    - Poythress critiques purely philosophical theodicies that neglect biblical data.
    - "We must let the Bible, not philosophy, set the terms for our understanding of evil." (Logic, p. 314)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s work has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions of **providence** and the **problem of evil**, especially through his multiperspectival method. His integration of biblical theology, philosophy, and science has provided a robust framework for addressing questions of divine sovereignty and human responsibility. Poythress’s writings continue to influence evangelical scholarship, particularly in the areas of theology, apologetics, and the relationship between faith and reason. His emphasis on the mystery and goodness of God in the face of evil encourages humility and trust in God’s wise purposes.
