# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and the **problem of evil** through a historicist and eschatological lens, emphasizing the openness of history and the self-revelation of God in time. He argued that God's knowledge and providential action are inseparable from the unfolding of history, culminating in the eschaton, where the meaning of evil and suffering is ultimately disclosed. Pannenberg rejected deterministic models, insisting that **human freedom** and the reality of evil are essential to understanding God's relational sovereignty.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological openness of history**
    - History is not a closed system but open to God's future.
    - Divine foreknowledge is tied to the final revelation at the end of history.
    - The meaning of events, including evil, is only fully disclosed eschatologically.
    - God’s providence works through the contingencies of history.
    - "The future is the horizon in which the meaning of all things will be revealed." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

2. **Relational divine omniscience**
    - God’s knowledge is dynamic and responsive to historical developments.
    - Divine foreknowledge does not negate genuine human freedom.
    - God knows all possibilities and actualities as they unfold.
    - The fullness of God’s knowledge is realized in the consummation of history.
    - "God’s omniscience is not static but is related to the process of history." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 1)

3. **Providence as participation, not control**
    - God’s providence is not deterministic but participatory.
    - God works within creation, respecting creaturely freedom.
    - Providence is exercised through persuasion and invitation, not coercion.
    - God’s purposes are achieved through the openness and risks of history.
    - "God’s rule is not the rule of a tyrant but the loving guidance of a Father." ("Theology and the Kingdom of God")

4. **Theodicy through eschatological vindication**
    - The problem of evil cannot be resolved apart from the future fulfillment of God’s kingdom.
    - Evil is permitted for the sake of genuine freedom and love.
    - The ultimate answer to evil is found in the resurrection and final judgment.
    - Suffering and evil are given meaning retrospectively in the light of the eschaton.
    - "Only in the light of the end can the meaning of suffering and evil be understood." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

5. **Christocentric revelation of God’s providence**
    - Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection are the definitive revelation of God’s providence.
    - The cross demonstrates God’s solidarity with human suffering and evil.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the pledge of God’s ultimate victory over evil.
    - The meaning of providence is interpreted through the Christ-event.
    - "The resurrection of Jesus is the proleptic manifestation of the end of history." ("Jesus—God and Man")

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s integration of **eschatology** with doctrines of divine foreknowledge and providence has significantly influenced contemporary theology, especially in discussions of the openness of God and theodicy. His emphasis on the historicity of revelation and the relational nature of God’s knowledge challenged both classical theism and process theology. Pannenberg’s thought continues to shape debates on the compatibility of divine sovereignty with human freedom and the ultimate resolution of evil in Christian hope.
