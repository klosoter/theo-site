# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a staunch defender of **Reformed orthodoxy**, especially regarding the **divine decrees** of **election** and **reprobation**. He upheld the **absolute sovereignty of God** in salvation, emphasizing that both election and reprobation are grounded in God's eternal purpose and not in foreseen faith or merit. Warfield’s articulation of these doctrines reflects a robust commitment to **predestination** as central to the biblical witness and the **Westminster Standards**.

- "The decree of election is not founded upon anything in those who are its objects, but finds its whole ground in God and in His mysterious love." (The Plan of Salvation)

## Key Works

- The Plan of Salvation
- Biblical and Theological Studies (essays on predestination)
- Calvin and Calvinism
- Selected Shorter Writings (ed. Meeter)
- The Westminster Assembly and Its Work

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty in Election**
   - Election is an act of God’s free will, not conditioned by human response.
   - God’s choice is rooted in His own purpose and pleasure.
   - Human merit or foreseen faith plays no role in determining the elect.
   - Election is a manifestation of God’s grace and not justice.
   - "Election is of grace, not of works, and is determined by the inscrutable counsel of God’s will." (The Plan of Salvation)

2. **Double Predestination**
   - Warfield affirms both election and reprobation as aspects of the divine decree.
   - Reprobation is not symmetrical with election; it is a passing over, not an active predestining to sin.
   - Both decrees serve to display God’s justice and mercy.
   - The decree of reprobation is just, as all are fallen in Adam.
   - "The decree of reprobation is not a decree to make sin, but to leave in sin." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

3. **Scriptural Foundation of Predestination**
   - Warfield grounds election and reprobation in the explicit teaching of Scripture.
   - He appeals to Pauline texts, especially Romans 9–11 and Ephesians 1.
   - The doctrine is not speculative but revealed and necessary for a biblical doctrine of salvation.
   - Scripture’s testimony is decisive over philosophical objections.
   - "Predestination is not a logical deduction, but a biblical assertion." (The Plan of Salvation)

4. **Harmony with Human Responsibility**
   - Divine sovereignty does not negate human responsibility.
   - God’s decrees are compatible with genuine human choices.
   - Warfield rejects fatalism and affirms the meaningfulness of gospel calls.
   - The mystery of concurrence is to be accepted, not resolved by rationalism.
   - "The divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both true, though we cannot fully harmonize them." (Calvin and Calvinism)

5. **Confessional Commitment**
   - Warfield defends the Westminster Confession’s articulation of the decrees.
   - He sees the confessional standards as faithful summaries of biblical teaching.
   - The doctrine of election is central to Reformed identity and assurance.
   - Warfield opposes any revisionist or mediating positions that dilute predestination.
   - "The Westminster Confession is the ripest fruit of Reformed confessionalism on the decrees of God." (The Westminster Assembly and Its Work)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s rigorous defense of **predestination** and the **divine decrees** solidified his reputation as a leading theologian of the Princeton tradition. His work provided a scholarly and pastoral articulation of election and reprobation that shaped twentieth-century Reformed theology. Warfield’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of **sovereignty** and **grace**, ensuring that the classic Reformed understanding of these doctrines remains a vital part of evangelical thought.
