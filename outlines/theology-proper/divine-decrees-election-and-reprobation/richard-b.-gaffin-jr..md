# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the doctrines of **divine decrees**, **election**, and **reprobation** within a robustly Reformed and redemptive-historical framework. He emphasizes the centrality of **union with Christ** and the eschatological realization of salvation, situating election not merely as an abstract decree but as integrally connected to the accomplishment and application of redemption in Christ.

- "Election is not an abstract decree but is realized in Christ and by the Spirit in the history of redemption." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "The Order of Salvation and the Theology of Paul" (in Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Atonement in the Pauline Corpus" (in The Glory of the Atonement, eds. Hill & Letham)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Election is Christocentric**
    - Election is fundamentally realized in **union with Christ**, not as an abstract decree.
    - The elect are chosen "in Christ" before the foundation of the world.
    - Christ himself is the locus and mediator of election.
    - The benefits of election are inseparable from participation in Christ’s redemptive work.
    - "All the blessings of salvation, including election, are found in union with Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - The decrees of God unfold in the history of redemption, not merely in timeless abstraction.
    - Election and reprobation are worked out through the historical accomplishment and application of salvation.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the decisive eschatological event for the elect.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the elect in history.
    - "The history of redemption is the history of the realization of God’s eternal purpose." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Reprobation as Judicial and Mysterious**
    - Reprobation is a real aspect of God’s decree but is ultimately inscrutable.
    - It is always presented in Scripture as a judicial act in response to sin.
    - Gaffin cautions against speculative or deterministic readings of reprobation.
    - The focus remains on the positive outworking of election in Christ.
    - "Scripture’s teaching on reprobation is always subordinate to and in service of the gospel." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Order of Salvation (Ordo Salutis) is Eschatologically Oriented**
    - The application of election is inseparable from the resurrection and exaltation of Christ.
    - The ordo salutis must be understood in light of the historia salutis (history of salvation).
    - The Spirit’s work is the eschatological realization of the decree of election.
    - Assurance of election is grounded in participation in Christ’s resurrection life.
    - "The ordo salutis is not an abstract sequence but the outworking of Christ’s resurrection in believers." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Scripture as the Norm for Understanding Decrees**
    - The doctrine of election and reprobation must be derived from and governed by the teaching of Scripture.
    - Gaffin resists speculative theology not anchored in biblical exegesis.
    - The Pauline corpus, especially Ephesians and Romans, is central for understanding election.
    - The mystery of God’s will is revealed in Christ and through the apostolic witness.
    - "The locus of revelation for election and reprobation is the apostolic gospel." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in its understanding of **union with Christ** and the redemptive-historical unfolding of the divine decrees. His Christocentric and eschatological emphasis has influenced a generation of pastors and scholars at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. By rooting election and reprobation in the history of redemption, Gaffin has provided a model for integrating classic Reformed doctrines with biblical theology. His careful attention to the priority of Scripture continues to guide discussions on the doctrine of God’s decrees.
