# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the doctrines of **divine decrees**, **election**, and **reprobation** through the lens of covenant theology, emphasizing the sovereign initiative of God in establishing **covenant relationships** and administering **redemptive history**. He highlighted the distinction between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, interpreting election as rooted in God's eternal purpose and reprobation as a manifestation of divine justice. Kline’s biblical-theological method sought to ground these doctrines in the unfolding structure of **biblical covenants**.

- "The divine decree is the foundation of the covenantal administration of history." (Kingdom Prologue)

- Treaty of the Great King: The Covenant Structure of Deuteronomy
- Images of the Spirit

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenantal Structure of Divine Decrees**
    - God’s decrees are administered through historical covenants, especially the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
    - Election and reprobation are realized in covenantal contexts, with blessings and curses tied to covenant fidelity.
    - The suzerain-vassal treaty model illuminates the outworking of God’s sovereign purposes.
    - The covenant serves as the historical vehicle for the manifestation of God’s eternal decree.
    - "The history of redemption is the history of the administration of the divine decree through covenant." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Sovereignty and Gracious Election**
    - Election is grounded solely in God’s sovereign will, not in foreseen faith or merit.
    - The elect are recipients of covenant grace, secured by God’s unilateral promise.
    - Election is typologically foreshadowed in figures like Abraham and Israel.
    - The covenant of grace is the sphere in which election is realized and applied.
    - "The principle of sovereign grace governs the covenant from its inception to its consummation." (By Oath Consigned)

3. **Judicial Reprobation**
    - Reprobation is the judicial counterpart to election, manifesting God’s justice.
    - The curses of the covenant fall upon those who break covenant, illustrating reprobation.
    - Historical judgments (e.g., the flood, exile) typify the ultimate reality of reprobation.
    - Reprobation is not arbitrary but is executed according to God’s righteous decree.
    - "Covenant curse is the historical expression of the decree of reprobation." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Outworking**
    - Election and reprobation are revealed progressively through typological events and persons.
    - The exodus, conquest, and exile serve as paradigms of God’s elective and reprobative acts.
    - Typology connects Old Testament patterns to their fulfillment in Christ and the church.
    - The structure of biblical covenants provides the framework for understanding the decrees.
    - "The typological structure of redemptive history displays the outworking of God’s decrees." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

5. **Christocentric Fulfillment of Election**
    - Christ is the ultimate Elect One, embodying the covenant promises and curses.
    - Union with Christ is the means by which individuals participate in election.
    - The church, as the new covenant community, is the locus of realized election.
    - The work of Christ secures both the blessings for the elect and the curse for the reprobate.
    - "In Christ, the covenant reaches its telos, and the decree of election is fulfilled." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal approach to **divine decrees** has significantly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in its integration of election and reprobation within the framework of redemptive history. His emphasis on the **covenant structure** and typology has influenced generations of scholars and pastors in understanding the outworking of God’s sovereign purposes. Kline’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to relate systematic and biblical theology, particularly regarding the doctrines of election and reprobation.
