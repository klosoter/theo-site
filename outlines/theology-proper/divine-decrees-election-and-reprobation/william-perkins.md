# William Perkins (1558–1602)

William Perkins was a foundational figure in the development of **Reformed theology** on the **divine decrees**, especially regarding **election** and **reprobation**. He articulated a clear, scholastic understanding of **predestination** rooted in the absolute sovereignty of God, distinguishing between God's unconditional choice of the elect and His just passing over of the reprobate. Perkins’ approach shaped the English Puritan tradition and influenced later confessional formulations.

- "Predestination is the decree of God, by which, according to the counsel of His own will, He hath constantly foreordained some to everlasting life, and others to everlasting death." (A Golden Chain)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Predestination as the Foundation of Salvation**
    - God’s **eternal decree** is the ultimate ground for both election and reprobation.
    - Election and reprobation are not based on foreseen faith or works.
    - The decree is rooted in God’s sovereign will and not conditioned by human merit.
    - Predestination is a central organizing principle in Perkins’ theological system.
    - "God hath predestinated men, not for their works, but for His own good pleasure." (A Golden Chain)

2. **Double Predestination: Election and Reprobation**
    - Perkins affirms both the positive decree to save (election) and the negative decree to pass over (reprobation).
    - Election is an act of **free grace**; reprobation is an act of **divine justice**.
    - The two aspects are logically distinct but inseparable in God’s decree.
    - Reprobation involves both preterition (passing by) and condemnation for sin.
    - "There is a double predestination: one to life, the other to death." (A Golden Chain)

3. **Christ as the Means of Election**
    - Christ is the mediator through whom the elect receive salvation.
    - Election is **in Christ**, not apart from Him.
    - The benefits of Christ’s work are applied only to the elect.
    - The decree of election includes both the end (salvation) and the means (faith in Christ).
    - "None are elected but in Christ, and none are reprobated but in Adam." (A Golden Chain)

4. **Assurance and the Practical Use of Election**
    - The doctrine of election is meant to comfort believers and encourage holiness.
    - Assurance comes through the fruits of faith and the promises of the gospel.
    - The preaching of election should not lead to despair but to gratitude and obedience.
    - The practical syllogism is used pastorally to help believers discern their election.
    - "The doctrine of predestination is to be handled with special wisdom and care, for the comfort of the godly." (A Golden Chain)

5. **God’s Justice and the Mystery of Reprobation**
    - God is just in reprobation, as it is based on His righteous will.
    - The reasons for God’s decrees are ultimately inscrutable to human reason.
    - Reprobation demonstrates God’s justice, while election displays His mercy.
    - Human responsibility is maintained alongside divine sovereignty.
    - "God’s will is the very rule of righteousness, and therefore what He wills is just." (A Golden Chain)

## Legacy and Impact

Perkins’ articulation of **predestination** profoundly shaped English Puritanism and the broader **Reformed tradition**, influencing the Westminster Standards and later theologians such as John Owen and Jonathan Edwards. His clear distinctions between **election** and **reprobation** provided a framework for pastoral application and doctrinal clarity. Perkins’ legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the sovereignty of God in salvation and the practical use of doctrine for the assurance and sanctification of believers.
