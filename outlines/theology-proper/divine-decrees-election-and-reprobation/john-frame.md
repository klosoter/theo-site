# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the doctrine of **divine decrees**, including **election** and **reprobation**, from a distinctly Reformed and presuppositional perspective, emphasizing the absolute **sovereignty of God** and the coherence of God’s plan with His character. He upholds the classic **Westminster Confession** stance while integrating his **triperspectivalism**, arguing that God’s decrees are comprehensive, wise, and always consistent with His nature as revealed in Scripture.

- "God’s decree is his eternal plan for all that happens, a plan that is comprehensive, wise, and ultimately for his own glory." ("Systematic Theology")

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- No Other God: A Response to Open Theism (2001)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty in Election and Reprobation**
    - God’s decrees encompass all things, including the destinies of individuals.
    - Election and reprobation are rooted in God’s sovereign will, not foreseen faith or merit.
    - God’s sovereignty is never arbitrary but always wise and just.
    - Human responsibility is upheld within the context of divine sovereignty.
    - "God’s sovereignty is not in tension with his goodness or justice." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Triperspectival Approach to Decrees**
    - Divine decrees are understood through normative (God’s law), situational (history), and existential (personal) perspectives.
    - This approach seeks to integrate biblical data, theological tradition, and personal experience.
    - Election and reprobation are not merely abstract doctrines but impact the believer’s life and assurance.
    - The triperspectival method guards against reductionism in doctrine.
    - "We must look at God’s decrees from every angle Scripture gives us." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Scriptural Foundation of Election**
    - The doctrine is grounded in explicit biblical texts (e.g., Romans 9, Ephesians 1).
    - Scripture, not philosophical speculation, is the ultimate authority for doctrine.
    - Election is presented as a source of comfort and assurance for believers.
    - Frame resists attempts to soften or rationalize the biblical teaching on reprobation.
    - "Scripture teaches both election and reprobation, and we must affirm both." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Compatibility of Divine Decrees and Human Responsibility**
    - God’s decrees do not negate genuine human choices.
    - Frame affirms compatibilism: God ordains all things, yet humans act freely according to their nature.
    - The mystery of concurrence is acknowledged but not resolved by human logic.
    - Moral accountability is preserved even under exhaustive divine sovereignty.
    - "God’s plan includes our choices, but does not violate our responsibility." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Pastoral and Practical Implications**
    - The doctrine of election is meant to humble believers and foster gratitude.
    - Assurance of salvation is rooted in God’s unchangeable purpose, not human effort.
    - The reality of reprobation calls for evangelistic urgency and compassion.
    - Frame emphasizes the doxological purpose of God’s decrees: to glorify Himself.
    - "The decrees of God are not merely abstract truths, but shape our worship and life." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **divine decrees** has reinforced a robust, biblically-grounded Reformed orthodoxy while offering fresh insights through his triperspectival method. His work has influenced contemporary discussions on **sovereignty**, election, and the relationship between God’s plan and human responsibility. Frame’s pastoral sensitivity and commitment to scriptural authority continue to shape evangelical and Reformed theology, especially among those seeking to integrate doctrine with practical Christian living.
