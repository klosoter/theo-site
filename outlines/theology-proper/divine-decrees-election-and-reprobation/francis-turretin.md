# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin was a leading voice in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulating a rigorous doctrine of the **divine decrees** with particular emphasis on **unconditional election** and **reprobation**. He defended the **absolute sovereignty of God** in predestination, maintaining that God's will is the ultimate ground for both the salvation of the elect and the just passing over of the reprobate, all while upholding divine justice and human responsibility.

- "Election is not founded upon foreseen faith or works, but upon the mere good pleasure of God." ("Institutes of Elenctic Theology")

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- The Doctrine of Predestination in Reformed Theology (secondary: Richard A. Muller)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Herman Bavinck, for context and influence)
- The Westminster Confession of Faith (as a confessional context for Turretin’s views)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unconditional Election**
    - Election is based solely on God's sovereign will, not on foreseen faith or merit.
    - The decree of election is eternal, immutable, and particular.
    - The elect are chosen in Christ to salvation and holiness.
    - Election is the cause, not the effect, of faith and good works.
    - "God does not elect because of faith, but He gives faith because He has elected." (Institutes)

2. **Preterition and Reprobation**
    - Reprobation consists of preterition (passing by) and condemnation.
    - God’s act of preterition is sovereign, not arbitrary or unjust.
    - Condemnation is based on foreseen sin, but preterition is not.
    - The decree of reprobation demonstrates God’s justice and holiness.
    - "Reprobation is not a mere permission, but a positive act of God’s will." (Institutes)

3. **Double Predestination**
    - Both election and reprobation are positive, eternal decrees of God.
    - There is an asymmetry: election is unto life, reprobation is unto just punishment.
    - God’s glory is manifested in both mercy (to the elect) and justice (to the reprobate).
    - The decrees are not conditioned by anything in the creature.
    - "The decree of election and reprobation are coordinate and mutually imply each other." (Institutes)

4. **Compatibilism of Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God’s decrees do not violate human freedom or responsibility.
    - Secondary causes are real and significant within God’s providence.
    - Human actions are freely chosen, though foreordained.
    - The mystery of divine sovereignty and human agency is to be humbly accepted.
    - "God’s decree does not take away liberty, but ordains it." (Institutes)

5. **Rejection of Conditional Predestination**
    - Opposes Arminian and Roman Catholic views of conditional election.
    - Asserts that faith and perseverance are fruits, not causes, of election.
    - Conditional predestination undermines the certainty of salvation.
    - The Reformed doctrine preserves the gratuity of grace.
    - "If election were from foresight of faith, grace would no longer be grace." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s precise articulation of **unconditional election** and **reprobation** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy, especially in the context of post-Reformation confessional theology. His influence is evident in the theological formulations of the **Westminster Standards** and in the work of later theologians such as Charles Hodge and Herman Bavinck. Turretin’s careful distinctions and scholastic method continue to shape discussions on the divine decrees, ensuring his enduring relevance in systematic theology.
