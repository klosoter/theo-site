# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the doctrines of **divine decrees**, **election**, and **reprobation** from a distinctly **Reformed** and **presuppositional** standpoint, emphasizing the absolute sovereignty of God and the antithesis between the Creator and the creature. He argued that **election** and **reprobation** are rooted in God's self-sufficient counsel, and that human understanding of these doctrines must be governed by the Creator-creature distinction and the authority of **Scripture**. Van Til insisted that any attempt to rationalize or mitigate these doctrines apart from **biblical revelation** leads to distortion and compromise.

- "God’s counsel is the ultimate reference point in predestination, and man’s responsibility is intelligible only in the light of this counsel." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Sovereignty of God in the Decrees**
    - God’s **decrees** are comprehensive, eternal, and not contingent upon creation.
    - Both **election** and **reprobation** flow from God’s sovereign will, not from foreseen faith or works.
    - The decrees are unified in God’s plan, not divided or arbitrary.
    - Human history unfolds according to God’s exhaustive plan, ensuring His glory.
    - "God’s counsel is the source of all that comes to pass, including the destinies of men." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - The difference between God’s knowledge and man’s knowledge is qualitative, not merely quantitative.
    - Man cannot judge or evaluate God’s decrees by autonomous reason.
    - The mystery of election and reprobation must be maintained, not resolved by human logic.
    - The decrees are ultimately incomprehensible except as revealed in Scripture.
    - "We must think God’s thoughts after Him, not attempt to stand above Him in judgment." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Primacy of Scriptural Revelation**
    - Scripture is the only authoritative source for understanding election and reprobation.
    - Attempts to harmonize these doctrines with human notions of fairness distort biblical teaching.
    - The doctrine of the decrees must be derived exegetically, not philosophically.
    - Biblical antithesis must be preserved: God’s grace and justice are not to be diluted.
    - "The Reformed doctrine of predestination is simply the doctrine of Scripture." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Antithesis and Covenant Representation**
    - The elect and reprobate represent two distinct humanities in covenant history.
    - The antithesis between belief and unbelief is rooted in God’s decree.
    - The covenant structure of redemptive history is determined by election and reprobation.
    - The church’s identity is grounded in its election by God, not in human achievement.
    - "The antithesis between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent is grounded in God’s decree." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Rejection of Neutrality and Autonomy**
    - There is no neutral ground from which to evaluate God’s decrees.
    - Human autonomy is a sinful attempt to escape God’s sovereign determination.
    - Apologetics must presuppose the truth of God’s decrees, including election and reprobation.
    - The reality of reprobation underscores the necessity of divine grace for salvation.
    - "To seek neutrality is to deny the Creator-creature distinction and the reality of God’s sovereign decree." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **divine sovereignty** in the decrees of election and reprobation has profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and systematic theology, especially through his emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the necessity of presupposing biblical revelation. His insistence on the antithesis between belief and unbelief, rooted in God’s decree, has influenced generations of theologians and apologists. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to a robust, confessional Reformed doctrine of predestination that resists both rationalistic reduction and sentimental revision.
