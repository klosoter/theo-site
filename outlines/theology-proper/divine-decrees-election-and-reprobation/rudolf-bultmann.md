# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the doctrines of **divine decrees**, **election**, and **reprobation** through the lens of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He rejected traditional metaphysical formulations of **predestination**, instead emphasizing the individual's encounter with the **kerygma** and the existential decision of faith. For Bultmann, the biblical language of election points to the call to authentic existence in response to God's Word, rather than to a fixed, eternal decree.

- "The concept of predestination is not a metaphysical assertion about the order of being, but a statement about the existential situation of man before God." (Faith and Understanding)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Election**
   - Election language is interpreted existentially, not metaphysically.
   - Biblical talk of **election** expresses the individual's confrontation with God's call.
   - The focus is on the present decision of faith, not on eternal decrees.
   - Traditional doctrines of **reprobation** are seen as mythological and existentially irrelevant.
   - "The mythological doctrine of predestination must be interpreted as a statement about the existential situation of man." (Faith and Understanding)

2. **Existential Decision and Responsibility**
   - Human beings are confronted by the **kerygma** and must respond in faith.
   - Election is realized in the individual's acceptance or rejection of the call.
   - There is no predetermined fate; responsibility lies with the person.
   - The existential moment of decision is central to salvation.
   - "Man is always summoned to decision by the word of God." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Metaphysical Predestination**
   - Bultmann denies that God eternally determines individuals' destinies.
   - Predestination is not a cosmic blueprint but a way of describing the seriousness of the call.
   - The doctrine is meaningful only as it addresses the hearer now.
   - Theological focus shifts from God's secret will to the proclamation of the gospel.
   - "Predestination is not a metaphysical fate but the seriousness of the call to faith." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Christocentric Interpretation of Election**
   - Election is centered on the revelation of God in **Jesus Christ**.
   - The community of the elect is defined by response to Christ, not by hidden decree.
   - The New Testament's language of election is interpreted through the event of Christ's resurrection.
   - The church is the locus where the call is heard and responded to.
   - "The elect are those who hear and respond to the word of Christ." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Scripture as Kerygma, Not Decree**
   - The Bible's statements about election and reprobation are proclamation, not ontological statements.
   - Scripture confronts the reader with the demand for faith, not with information about God's secret will.
   - The authority of the text lies in its existential impact, not in metaphysical content.
   - The doctrine of election serves to awaken authentic existence before God.
   - "Scripture speaks not to inform us about God's decrees, but to call us to decision." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's existential reinterpretation of **election** and **reprobation** profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the realms of **biblical hermeneutics** and existentialist thought. His approach challenged traditional Reformed and Lutheran doctrines, prompting ongoing debate about the nature of divine sovereignty and human responsibility. While many criticized his rejection of metaphysical categories, Bultmann's focus on the individual's encounter with the Word continues to shape discussions on the meaning of **predestination** in contemporary theology.
