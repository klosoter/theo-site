# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the doctrine of **divine decrees**—especially **election and reprobation**—with a strong emphasis on the personal and relational character of God, rejecting deterministic or abstract formulations. He critiqued classical **Reformed predestinarianism** for undermining human responsibility and the universal offer of grace, instead stressing the centrality of **Christ** as the locus of election and the necessity of human response to God's call.

- "Election is not a metaphysical decree, but the act of God in Christ, calling men to Himself." ("The Christian Doctrine of God")

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Election is Christocentric**
    - Election is grounded in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - God’s choice is not an abstract decree but is revealed concretely in Christ’s saving act.
    - The doctrine must be interpreted through the lens of the gospel, not speculative metaphysics.
    - Christ is both the electing God and the elected man, uniting divine initiative and human response.
    - "In Christ, God has chosen all men, and only in Him is election realized." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Rejection of Double Predestination**
    - Brunner opposes the idea that God predestines some to salvation and others to damnation.
    - He views **reprobation** as a consequence of human rejection, not a divine decree.
    - The divine will is fundamentally oriented toward salvation, not condemnation.
    - The mystery of unbelief is left unresolved, emphasizing human responsibility.
    - "God does not will the damnation of any; reprobation is the shadow side of election, not its counterpart." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

3. **Divine Freedom and Human Responsibility**
    - God’s sovereignty is not exercised at the expense of genuine human freedom.
    - Election calls for a personal response; it does not override human will.
    - The encounter with God’s call is existential and relational, not mechanical.
    - Brunner affirms the seriousness of the human decision in the drama of salvation.
    - "The divine call demands a free response; compulsion would destroy the relationship." (Truth as Encounter)

4. **Universal Offer of Grace**
    - The gospel is genuinely addressed to all, not a select few.
    - Brunner insists on the universality of God’s salvific will.
    - The doctrine of election must not undermine the proclamation of grace to every person.
    - The church’s mission is grounded in the assurance that God desires all to be saved.
    - "The message of election is the message of God’s Yes to all men in Christ." (The Mediator)

5. **Revelation over Speculation**
    - Brunner prioritizes biblical revelation over philosophical or logical systems.
    - He warns against constructing doctrines of election from abstract principles.
    - The mystery of God’s will must be respected; not all questions can be answered.
    - Faith rests on God’s self-disclosure, not on human attempts to penetrate divine secrets.
    - "We must not go beyond what is revealed; the doctrine of election is a mystery grounded in revelation." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **election and reprobation** significantly influenced modern Protestant theology by challenging deterministic readings and emphasizing the relational and Christ-centered nature of God’s call. His insistence on the **universal offer of grace** and the existential dimension of faith shaped later discussions on predestination, especially within neo-orthodox and ecumenical circles. While his views diverged from classical Reformed orthodoxy, they contributed to a renewed focus on the gospel’s inclusive scope and the dynamic encounter between God and humanity.
