### ESSAY
The doctrine of the divine decrees states that God, in the simplicity and immutability of his eternal will, has ordained whatsoever comes to pass. Within that universal determination lies a specific and high point: **unconditional election** unto life and **reprobation** unto just punishment. The conceptual terms must be exact. The decree is one in God because of **divine simplicity**, yet reason considers distinct aspects according to the distinct creatures and ends God wills. Election is God’s gracious choice of certain particular sinners in Christ to salvation, including the gift of effectual calling, faith, justification, sanctification, and glorification. Reprobation is God’s passing by others in the distribution of saving grace and his ordination to their just condemnation for sin. The asymmetry of election and reprobation is crucial: in election God positively gives saving grace; in reprobation God withholds that particular grace and ordains punishment for foreseen and ordained sins, so that sin is the proximate ground of damnation while grace alone is the cause of salvation. Although the decree is eternal and simple, its logical order relative to the fall admits of debate. The Reformed distinguish supralapsarian and infralapsarian representations of intention. I will defend infralapsarianism as best capturing the asymmetry and the scriptural idiom, though supralapsarianism can be maintained without collapsing into equal ultimacy when carefully construed. The whole doctrine stands or falls with a coherent account of **primary and secondary causality**, **compatibilist freedom**, and the noncompetitive agency of the simple God.

Augustine of Hippo established the anti-Pelagian contours of Western predestinarian thought. Against Pelagius and Julian, Augustine argued in On the Predestination of the Saints and On the Gift of Perseverance that the entire race lies in Adam’s massa perditionis. Only those whom God mercifully elects receive the donum perseverantiae. Election is not grounded in foreseen merits or faith, because such foreseen faith would itself be a gift of grace. Augustine’s soteriology is ecclesial and sacramental, but its conceptual core is the priority and efficacy of grace over the fallen will. His anthropology is not merely pessimistic; it is metaphysically careful. Human wills are real causes, but their freedom is always the freedom of a nature, and fallen nature is not indifferent. He denies that divine foreknowledge is passive vision, and equally denies that predestination forces unwilling sinners; God works in the will exquisitely so that the redeemed will freely. On the reprobate Augustine speaks cautiously in terms of God’s justice and inscrutable judgments. He articulates an asymmetry: as mercy does not find but makes the elect good, so justice finds the reprobate evil and punishes what is truly theirs. The permission of evil is not a bare non-act but a wise ordination that God intends for the manifestation of justice and mercy. The Pelagian and semi-Pelagian objections force him to distinguish God’s antecedent will for the good of creatures and his consequent will to permit sin for greater goods without implying internal conflict. Augustine thus furnishes the grammar of **compatibilist freedom** and the asymmetry of grace and justice that later Reformed divines systematize.

Thomas Aquinas embeds predestination within a comprehensive doctrine of providence. In the Summa Theologiae, predestination is a part of providence insofar as God’s plan orders rational creatures to beatitude. Aquinas’s metaphysics of **divine simplicity** and **primary causality** is decisive. God is pure act and the first cause of all that has being. His willing is identical with his essence, non-temporal and changeless. Because God wills ends through means, he moves secondary causes without violating their natures. The motion of the will by God is not coercion but the cause of free act, freeing freedom. With respect to reprobation, Thomas explicates two elements. First, God wills not to give some the grace by which they would infallibly be saved. Second, he wills to permit their sin and ordains the punishment justly due. This is again asymmetry: the salvific good is simply God’s to give, while the evil of sin results from the defect of the secondary cause, though its occurrence lies under God’s providence. Aquinas refuses both Pelagian merit and arbitrary divine whim. His account of the will’s inclination, the distinction of God’s antecedent and consequent will, and the denial that God’s choice is determined by creatures lays the metaphysical foundation upon which the Reformed will build their doctrine of decree. Crucially, Aquinas’s defense of contingency under providence shows that necessity relative to God’s decree does not erase the modal texture of created causes: some things are necessary by nature, others contingent, all because God wills diverse modes of being. This template will be enlisted by the Reformed to deny that predestination entails fatalism.

John Calvin reframes predestination within a pastoral soteriology centered on Christ. In Institutes 3.21–24 and in The Eternal Predestination of God, Calvin presses the unconditionality of election and the reality of reprobation not as speculative curiosities but as the grammar of grace. The elect are chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world, and their knowledge of election is mediated through union with Christ, who is the mirror of our election. Calvin is not shy about “the dreadful decree,” because it secures that salvation is wholly of God’s mercy, terminating human boasting. Yet he guards against fatalism and equal ultimacy with two commitments. First, his robust use of the distinction between God’s secret will and revealed will allows him to affirm the genuine and **well-meant offer** of the gospel, the duty of faith, and the ordained use of means. God predestines both the ends and the means. Second, Calvin applies the language of permission for sin without divorcing it from ordination. God’s will is never thwarted, yet the culpability of sin lies wholly with the sinner. That is not a verbal evasion; it is a consistent use of **primary and secondary causality** and **concurrence**. On lapsarian order Calvin is cautious, disallowing curious speculation, though his stress on Adamic headship and the sequence of history resonate with infralapsarian expression. Calvin’s polemics with Pighius and Bolsec make clear that faith as foreseen is not a cause but an effect of election, and that any attempt to ground election in foreknown merits destroys assurance and collapses grace into cooperative synergy. Calvin’s insistence that God does not love the elect because they are lovely, but makes them lovely because he loves them, captures the Reformed insistence on the absolute priority of **unconditional election**.

Jacob Arminius emerges as the central external reformer of the debate. In his Declaration of Sentiments, Arminius redefines predestination as God’s decree to save those who believe in Christ and persevere. This decree is conditioned upon God’s foreknowledge of who would freely believe when aided by prevenient grace. Arminius rejects unconditional individual reprobation as incompatible with divine justice and goodness, preferring to speak of rejection due to persistent unbelief. He insists on universal prevenient grace that renders faith possible for all but not certain for any. Romans 9 is read as dealing with corporate election to service rather than individual election to salvation. The Arminian scheme preserves libertarian free will and locates the decisive factor in the creature’s self-determining response to grace. The cost, however, is profound. The ground of differentiation among sinners is no longer God’s gracious will but the creature’s act, and assurance becomes in principle contingent upon the stability of that act. Moreover, the instrument of salvation, faith, becomes a meritorious differentiator unless a sophisticated account of grace as non-determining yet enabling is sustained, a difficult balance. The Reformed reply, shaped by Augustine and Calvin, is that foreseen faith explains nothing. If the object foreseen depends on prior gifts of grace, then the line of causality has already returned to the divine initiative; if it does not, then grace is reduced and God’s glory in salvation is divided. Arminianism’s appeal to fairness presupposes that equal treatment is an obligation on God. The Reformed insist instead that justice binds God to give no one less than his deserts and that mercy is free bounty that cannot be owed.

Luis de Molina offers a different external proposal in the face of Dominican Thomism and later Reformed determinacy. In the Concordia, Molina introduces scientia media, or middle knowledge, by which God knows, prior to his decree, what any free creature would do in any possible set of circumstances. God then decrees to actualize a world in which the free acts he prefers are obtained by situating agents in circumstances where he knows they would freely act as desired. Election thus becomes conditional not on foreknown merits, strictly speaking, but on counterfactuals of creaturely freedom that God passively contemplates and then exploits. The motive is to secure strong sovereignty without predetermining the will. The Reformed and Dominican objections strike at the heart: the grounding objection asks what makes the counterfactuals true prior to God’s decree if the creature does not yet exist. If they are true independently of God, then divinity is subject to a contingent order it did not ordain, compromising **aseity** and **simplicity**. If they are grounded in God, the distinction between middle and natural knowledge collapses. Molinism also redistributes causality such that God’s decree is reactive to independent creaturely acts. The cost is a muted doctrine of **divine simplicity** and a theology of concurrence that cannot explain why some are infallibly saved without God’s determining grace. Though elegant, Molinism’s metaphysics is thin where Reformed scholasticism is thick.

Francis Turretin provides the classic Reformed scholastic articulation and defense. In the Institutes of Elenctic Theology, he refines the Augustinian and Calvinian insights with rigorous distinctions. The decree is one and simple in God, yet many by a rational distinction on our part. Turretin’s treatment of **reprobation** forestalls the charge of equal ultimacy by a twofold distinction: preterition and condemnation. Preterition is the negative act of passing by, the denial of special grace; condemnation is the positive act of damning for sin. As regards the cause of difference, Turretin asserts that God’s will is the discriminating cause in election, while sin is the meritorious cause in damnation. The asymmetry is absolute. He denies that reprobation makes God the author of sin by distinguishing efficient from deficient causes: God’s will efficaciously concurs with the act as act, but the privation and malice of sin arise from the creature’s deficiency. He describes permission not as a mere non-willing but as the wise ordination of evils for a righteous end, preserving divine **immutability** and **providence** while maintaining creaturely responsibility. On lapsarian order, Turretin advocates infralapsarianism as safer and more consonant with Scripture’s presentation of God viewing the mass of fallen humanity and electing some out of it. Supralapsarianism, which logically places election to glory and reprobation to damnation before the decree to permit the fall, he tolerates as within orthodoxy, provided it maintains the asymmetry and eschews any doctrine of equal causality with respect to good and evil. Turretin also rejects Amyraldian hypothetical universalism as incoherent with the particularity of the decree and the unity of the work of the Trinity in **particular redemption**. For Turretin, the **federal theology** of the covenants of works and grace is the historical theater in which the decree is executed: Adam’s **federal headship** explains original guilt and corruption, and Christ’s headship explains the certain salvation of the elect. This federal frame guards against readings of predestination that ignore the economy where God binds himself to promises and conditions as ordained means.

Internal Reformed debates must be faced with candor. On lapsarianism, the infralapsarian presentation better captures the scriptural logic of God’s pity toward the fallen, preserves the asymmetry in reprobation, and avoids representing God as willing damnation as such prior to the fall. On equal ultimacy, Reformed orthodoxy denies it, insisting that God’s positive act in election has no symmetrical counterpart in producing sin. The efficient cause of good is God in a special way, while evil is efficiently from creatures under God’s providence. On the **well-meant offer**, the free and sincere call of the gospel expresses the revealed will of God that all who believe should be saved. This is not at odds with particular election because the means of the call are ordained to the end of gathering the elect and leaving the rest without excuse; the sufficiency of Christ’s sacrifice is unlimited with respect to intrinsic worth, though its intent is particular. Amyraldianism attempted to universalize the intent of the atonement under a hypothetical condition while preserving particular application. The classic Reformed reply is that it introduces dissonance into the Trinitarian work of redemption and sows confusion about the design of the cross and intercession. The coherence of decree across **Trinity**, **atonement**, and **effectual calling** must be preserved.

External debates move along different fault lines. Arminian conditional election resolves anxieties about divine justice by making salvation hinge on human libertarian choice assisted by universal grace. The Reformed respond with Augustine that such a move subtly reintroduces merit, undermines assurance, and grants to fallen will a self-determining power Scripture does not ascribe. Molinism protects a robust providence by posting a pre-volitional set of counterfactual truths that allow God to orchestrate a world of libertarianly free choices. The Reformed object that this jettisons **aseity** and renders the divine decree dependent on creaturely possibilities not fixed by God. Thomist Banezianism aligns more closely with the Reformed by positing physical premotion, yet differs in the mechanics of God’s motion and the offer of grace, a difference that remains intramural to classical theism. Corporate election proposals reduce Romans 9 to service roles and thereby evacuate Paul’s rhetoric about vessels of mercy and wrath of its soteriological specificity. Reformed federalism already accounts for a corporate dimension via headship while retaining individual election.

Contemporary debates require fresh articulation. Open theism and process theology attack the premise of exhaustive **foreknowledge** and an immutable decree. If God does not know future free acts, election decomposes into a general intention of God to save those who can be saved. The cost is unacceptable: the God of Scripture repeatedly claims the exhaustiveness of his counsel and knowledge. Karl Barth recasts election as the primordial decision of God to be for humanity in Christ. He rightly centers election in Christ but collapses the decree into God’s own being in a way that threatens **immutability** and posits a universalizing drift not borne out by Scripture. In analytic philosophy, grounding objections to foreknowledge and decree, as well as critiques of compatibilism, press the Reformed to argue with precision. The best reply integrates the Aquinas-Augustine-Turretin line: God’s knowledge and will are not discursive; God’s concursive causality establishes the very domain in which creaturely causation operates; Frankfurt-style cases show that freedom does not require alternative possibilities, only moral ownership. In the pastoral sphere, assurance and evangelism are the pressing concerns. The doctrine of election severs assurance from self and grounds it in Christ’s promise and the Spirit’s **effectual calling**. Evangelism is not vain because the decree includes means; God gathers his elect through the preaching of the gospel and prayer. The doctrine emboldens mission by assuring that our labors are not in vain.

The position I defend is classic Reformed infralapsarianism. God, in the **eternal decree**, has unconditionally elected a definite number of fallen sinners to salvation in union with Christ and, by contrast, has passed by the rest and ordained them to just punishment for their sins. This decree is one act of the simple, immutable God, internally identical with his essence and externally executed in time by the Son and Spirit. The asymmetry is the keystone. Scripture’s grammar supports it. In Ephesians 1 God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, predestining us to adoption according to the good pleasure of his will. Romans 9 speaks of vessels of mercy prepared beforehand for glory and vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, and Paul’s rhetorical structure magnifies the freedom of mercy without imputing arbitrariness to God’s justice. Acts 13 notes that as many as were appointed to eternal life believed, rooting the act of believing in a prior appointment. John 6’s promise that all whom the Father gives to the Son will come and that none will be lost shows the tight bond between election and effectual calling. The Reformed read these texts in accord with a **federal theology** in which Adam’s sin renders all justly condemnable and Christ’s obedience secures salvation for the elect.

Examiner challenges must be anticipated. Does this make God the author of sin? No. Author denotes efficient causality of the moral defect. God is the first cause of the act as act, willing to permit the defect and order it; the defect arises from the finite secondary cause as deficient. Does this collapse human responsibility? No. Responsibility attaches to acts that proceed from the agent’s will with knowledge, which the decree secures but does not annihilate. Does unconditional election render God arbitrary? No. Arbitrary means without reason; God has reasons grounded in his own wisdom and the manifestation of his glory, though they are not reasons extrinsic to him. Why are some saved and not others? Scripture answers in terms of mercy and justice. Why preach the gospel? Because God ordains the means to the ends, and the sincere call of the gospel is both the instrument of gathering and a revelation of God’s goodness. What of infants dying in infancy? The decree is silent on individuals apart from fruit, but God saves whom he will even among infants by an extraordinary work of the Spirit, and the church commends them to God’s mercy in Christ. How can multiple decrees coexist with **divine simplicity**? The distinction of decrees is a conceptual analysis of one simple act; their multiplicity reflects the multiplicity of effects in the creaturely order. How can reprobation be just if sin is decreed? Because decree does not coerce; God ordains that a responsible agent will sin, and the sin really proceeds from that agent’s will; justice punishes according to demerit.

This doctrine must cohere across loci. In the doctrine of God, **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity** frame the decree as properly divine and not composite or reactive. In Christology, election is in Christ as mediatorial head; the Son is the executor of the decree, and his cross is designed for those whom the Father has given him, which implies **particular redemption**. In pneumatology, the Spirit’s **effectual calling** ensures that election is not merely forensic designation but vivification, uniting the elect to Christ by faith. In anthropology, **compatibilist freedom** replaces libertarian indifference; in hamartiology, original sin under **federal headship** explains the mass of perdition. In ecclesiology, the mixed body of the visible church cautions against presumption and locates assurance not in secret knowledge of the decree but in the gospel promises, sacraments, and fruits of sanctification. The covenants structure the execution of the decree historically: the broken **covenant of works** warrants condemnation, the **covenant of grace** grants Christ and all his benefits to the elect.

Contemporary anxieties often demand existential counsel. The doctrine should not be preached to pry into the hidden will but to humble the proud, console the trembling, and fuel mission. The decree does not render prayer useless; it renders it hopeful. The decree does not negate rational agency; it gives creaturely action its place in a purposive world. Those who object that this creates a chilly metaphysics should consider the alternative: if God’s purposes are contingent on creaturely contingencies that lie outside his counsel, then evil and the destiny of souls float free of ultimate meaning. Classical predestination secures that nothing comes to pass apart from wisdom and goodness. When pressed that this yields a determinate tragedy for the reprobate, the Reformed confess a mystery of judgment, but not a contradiction. Mercy’s gratuity does not imply injustice; justice’s strictness does not diminish mercy. The asymmetry guards the goodness of God while admitting the severity of his justice.

In sum, Augustine gives the soteriological stakes, Aquinas the metaphysical grammar, Calvin the pastoral Christocentrism, Arminius and Molina the rival conditions and foreknowledge schemes, and Turretin the scholastic exactitude. The Reformed doctrine of election and reprobation, when articulated with these resources, is not a speculative add-on but the architecture of grace under **divine simplicity**. It preserves the sovereignty of God, the responsibility of man, the certainty of salvation for the elect, and the sincerity of the gospel for all. It replaces caprice with counsel and anxiety with assurance. It will always offend Pelagian instincts and deterministic caricatures alike, but it best answers to the claims of Scripture and the demands of classical theism. The candidate should be prepared to grant the gravity of the doctrine, to acknowledge the mysteries of God’s will, and to defend the coherence of **unconditional election** and asymmetrical **reprobation** in the only place where theology can stand secure: the wise and good God who works all things according to the counsel of his will, and who gives Christ to his people from eternity to eternity.

### RECAP NOTES

- Likely examiner questions:
  - Author of sin? God concurs in the act as act; the defect is from the creature’s deficiency.
  - Why not equal ultimacy? Salvation is from positive gift; damnation is for demerit with withheld special grace.
  - How square with evangelism? God decrees means; the **well-meant offer** is sincere and effective to the elect.
  - Does this deny freedom? No, it affirms **compatibilist freedom**, sufficient for responsibility.
  - How does simplicity allow many decrees? Many by reason, one simple will in God.
  - Why infralapsarianism? Better expresses scriptural pity toward the fallen and preserves asymmetry.
