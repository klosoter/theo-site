# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a doctrine of the **divine decrees** that emphasizes God's eternal, unchangeable will as the source of all things, including **election** and **reprobation**. He maintained that God, in His perfect wisdom and justice, predestines some to **eternal life** while permitting others to fall into **reprobation**, always subordinating these decrees to the order of **divine providence** and the ultimate manifestation of God's **glory**.

- "God therefore wills the salvation of all men, yet not so that all attain salvation, but so that those whom He has predestined to eternal life are saved." (Summa Theologiae I, q.23, a.3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Will as the Source of Election and Reprobation**
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of both election and reprobation.
    - Election is an act of mercy; reprobation is an act of justice.
    - Both are rooted in the simplicity and immutability of the divine will.
    - God’s decrees are not conditioned by foreseen merit or demerit.
    - "Predestination presupposes election in the order of reason; for none are predestined except those whom God has chosen to eternal salvation." (Summa Theologiae I, q.23, a.4)

2. **Predestination as Part of Divine Providence**
    - Predestination is a subset of God’s universal providence over all creation.
    - God orders all things to their proper end, including rational creatures.
    - The predestined are directed infallibly to eternal life.
    - Providence includes permission of evil for the sake of greater good.
    - "Predestination is a part of providence, as it is the plan concerning the salvation of certain persons." (Summa Theologiae I, q.23, a.1)

3. **Election is Unconditional and Gracious**
    - God’s election is not based on foreseen faith or works.
    - Grace is given freely to the elect, preceding any human response.
    - The reason for election is found in God alone, not in the creature.
    - The elect are chosen “from eternity” for salvation.
    - "God does not choose men because they are good, but makes them good because He has chosen them." (Summa Theologiae I, q.23, a.5)

4. **Reprobation as Permissive, Not Causative**
    - God’s reprobation is a permissive decree, not a direct cause of sin.
    - God permits some to fall away, withholding efficacious grace.
    - Reprobation results in just punishment for sin, not arbitrary condemnation.
    - The distinction between election and reprobation upholds divine justice and mercy.
    - "Reprobation includes the will to permit a person to fall into sin, and to impose the punishment of damnation for sin." (Summa Theologiae I, q.23, a.3)

5. **The End of Election and Reprobation: Manifestation of Divine Glory**
    - Both election and reprobation serve the ultimate end of manifesting God’s glory.
    - The salvation of the elect displays God’s mercy.
    - The just punishment of the reprobate displays God’s justice.
    - The order of the universe is perfected by the diversity of outcomes.
    - "God wished to show forth His goodness in men, in respect of both mercy and justice." (Summa Theologiae I, q.21, a.4)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **divine decrees** profoundly shaped later Catholic and Protestant thought, especially in debates over **predestination** and the relationship between **grace** and human freedom. His careful distinctions between **election** and **reprobation**, and his insistence on the primacy of God’s will, became foundational for scholastic theology. While later Reformed theologians would modify aspects of his system, Aquinas’s synthesis of **providence**, justice, and mercy remains a central reference point in discussions of election and reprobation.
