# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the **divine decrees**, including **election** and **reprobation**, through the lens of religious consciousness and the communal life of the church. Rather than grounding election in an eternal, inscrutable will, he emphasized the realization of **redemption** in the historical community of believers, making **predestination** a function of the church’s existence and experience rather than an abstract decree.

- "The doctrine of election is to be understood only in connection with the existence and development of the Christian Church." (The Christian Faith, §120)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Election is ecclesial, not individualistic**
    - Election is realized in the **community of believers**, not in isolated individuals.
    - The church is the locus where **redemption** is actualized.
    - Individual election is derivative of participation in the church.
    - The focus shifts from metaphysical decree to historical manifestation.
    - "Election is not to be understood as a selection of individuals, but as the determination of the church as a whole." (The Christian Faith, §120)

2. **Divine decrees are expressions of God’s redemptive will**
    - The decrees are not arbitrary but are tied to the purpose of **redemption**.
    - God’s will is oriented toward the realization of salvation in history.
    - The decrees are intelligible through the unfolding of the church’s life.
    - Emphasis on the dynamic, teleological nature of God’s will.
    - "The divine decree is nothing other than the will to bring about the kingdom of God in the world." (The Christian Faith, §119)

3. **Reprobation is subordinate and relative**
    - Schleiermacher minimizes the role of **reprobation** in his system.
    - Reprobation is defined only in relation to the church’s existence.
    - There is no parallel decree of reprobation; focus is on the positive decree of election.
    - The concept serves to highlight the distinctiveness of the church.
    - "There is no divine decree of reprobation corresponding to the decree of election." (The Christian Faith, §121)

4. **Predestination is grounded in Christ and the Spirit**
    - The **person and work of Christ** are central to understanding election.
    - The Spirit’s activity in the church actualizes the divine decree.
    - Election is inseparable from the historical revelation in Christ.
    - The church’s unity with Christ is the basis for its election.
    - "The election of the church is grounded in the redemptive work of Christ and the communication of the Spirit." (The Christian Faith, §120)

5. **Human consciousness participates in the divine decree**
    - Religious self-consciousness is the medium through which election is experienced.
    - The sense of dependence on God is foundational to understanding predestination.
    - The experience of grace in the community is the evidence of election.
    - The decrees are not external impositions but are realized in lived faith.
    - "The consciousness of being elected arises from participation in the life of the Christian community." (The Christian Faith, §122)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **divine decrees** profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology by relocating the doctrine of **election** from the realm of abstract metaphysics to the lived experience of the church. His emphasis on the communal and historical realization of redemption influenced later developments in **ecclesiology** and the theology of revelation. While his views diverged sharply from classical Reformed orthodoxy, they opened new avenues for understanding predestination in relation to Christ and the Spirit. Schleiermacher remains a pivotal figure for those seeking to reconcile traditional doctrines with modern consciousness and historical development.
