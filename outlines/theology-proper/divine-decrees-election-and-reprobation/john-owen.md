# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen, a leading Puritan theologian, articulated a robust doctrine of the **divine decrees**, emphasizing the absolute sovereignty of God in **election** and **reprobation**. He upheld **unconditional election** and **particular redemption**, insisting that God's eternal purpose determines the salvation of the elect and the just passing over of the reprobate, all to the glory of God's justice and mercy.

- "The foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable dependence on him, is laid in his unchangeable will and purpose." (The Works of John Owen, Vol. 10)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Sovereignty of God in Decrees**
    - God’s decrees are eternal, unchangeable, and independent of human action.
    - Election and reprobation are grounded solely in God's sovereign will.
    - The decrees encompass all things, but especially the destinies of individuals.
    - Human history unfolds according to God’s predetermined plan.
    - "God doth not foresee that men will believe, and therefore choose them; but he chooseth them, that they may believe." (A Display of Arminianism)

2. **Unconditional Election**
    - Election is not based on foreseen faith or merit in the individual.
    - God’s choice of the elect is rooted in his grace alone.
    - The elect are chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world.
    - Election ensures the infallible salvation of those chosen.
    - "Election is the free, gracious, and immutable purpose of God, whereby he hath chosen in Christ a certain number of men unto eternal life." (The Death of Death)

3. **Particular Redemption (Limited Atonement)**
    - Christ’s atonement is intended only for the elect.
    - The efficacy of Christ’s death is limited to those whom God has chosen.
    - Redemption is accomplished and applied infallibly to the elect.
    - The atonement secures everything necessary for the salvation of the elect.
    - "For whom Christ died, for them he purchased faith, repentance, and all saving graces." (The Death of Death)

4. **Doctrine of Reprobation**
    - Reprobation is the passing over of some in God’s decree, leaving them to their just condemnation.
    - It is not an arbitrary act but displays God’s justice and holiness.
    - The non-elect are not actively predestined to sin, but are left in their fallen state.
    - Reprobation serves to magnify the mercy shown to the elect.
    - "God’s decree of reprobation is not the cause of sin, but of the just punishment of sin." (A Display of Arminianism)

5. **Assurance Rooted in Divine Decree**
    - The certainty of salvation for the elect rests on God’s unchangeable purpose.
    - Believers can have assurance because God’s decree cannot fail.
    - Assurance is strengthened by the Spirit’s witness and the fruits of election.
    - The perseverance of the saints is guaranteed by God’s decree.
    - "The immutability of God’s counsel is the great foundation of the saints’ consolation." (The Doctrine of the Saints’ Perseverance)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s rigorous articulation of **unconditional election** and **particular redemption** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy, especially in debates with Arminianism. His defense of the sovereignty of God’s will in salvation influenced the Westminster Confession and subsequent Puritan and Reformed theologians. Owen’s work continues to shape discussions on the nature of the **divine decrees**, providing a robust framework for understanding election and reprobation within the Reformed tradition.
