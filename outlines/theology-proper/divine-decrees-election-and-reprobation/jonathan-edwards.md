# Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758)

Jonathan Edwards articulated a robust doctrine of the **divine decrees**, emphasizing God's absolute sovereignty in **election** and **reprobation**. He maintained that God's will is the ultimate cause of all things, including the destinies of individuals, and that **predestination** is grounded in God's glory and wisdom rather than any foreseen merit or action.

- "God’s sovereignty has ever appeared to me, as a great part of his glory." (The Works of Jonathan Edwards, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Freedom of the Will
- The End for Which God Created the World
- Original Sin
- Miscellanies (notebooks)
- Sermons: "A Divine and Supernatural Light," "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Sovereignty of God**
   - God’s will is the ultimate and decisive cause of all events, including salvation and damnation.
   - The decrees of election and reprobation are not contingent upon human actions or foreseen faith.
   - God’s sovereignty is exercised in perfect wisdom and justice, displaying His glory.
   - Human beings are entirely dependent on God’s sovereign choice for their eternal destinies.
   - "God is pleased, as a sovereign God, to distribute his grace as he pleases." (Freedom of the Will)

2. **Unconditional Election**
   - Election is based solely on God’s good pleasure and not on any foreseen virtue or faith in the elect.
   - The elect are chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world.
   - God’s purpose in election is to magnify the riches of His grace.
   - The certainty of salvation for the elect rests entirely on God’s immutable decree.
   - "Those that are chosen from eternity, are chosen not for their works, but for the sake of Christ." (Miscellanies)

3. **Reprobation as the Withholding of Grace**
   - Reprobation is the passing over of some individuals, leaving them in their sin.
   - God withholds regenerating grace from the reprobate according to His sovereign will.
   - Reprobation demonstrates God’s justice and the seriousness of sin.
   - The non-elect are not made sinful by God, but are left to their own fallen nature.
   - "God does nothing but leave them to themselves, and let them alone in their own ways." (Freedom of the Will)

4. **Harmony of Divine Decrees and Human Responsibility**
   - God’s decrees do not violate human responsibility or moral agency.
   - Human choices are real and significant, though ultimately governed by God’s sovereign will.
   - The compatibility of divine sovereignty and human freedom is central to Edwards’s theology.
   - The decrees establish, rather than undermine, the meaningfulness of human actions.
   - "The sovereignty of God’s decrees consists not in their being contrary to men’s liberty, but in their being the foundation of it." (Freedom of the Will)

5. **The Glory of God as the Ultimate End**
   - The purpose of election and reprobation is the manifestation of God’s glory.
   - God’s glory is displayed in both the salvation of the elect and the just condemnation of the reprobate.
   - All of God’s decrees are ordered toward the ultimate end of His own self-exaltation.
   - The doctrine of decrees is inseparable from Edwards’s vision of God-centered reality.
   - "God is glorified not only by his glory’s being seen, but by its being rejoiced in." (The End for Which God Created the World)

## Legacy and Impact

Edwards’s articulation of **divine sovereignty** and the doctrines of **election and reprobation** profoundly shaped the trajectory of American Reformed theology. His rigorous defense of unconditional election and the harmony of God’s decrees with human responsibility influenced later theologians and remains a touchstone in debates on predestination. Edwards’s vision of God’s glory as the ultimate end of all things continues to inspire theological reflection and devotion within Reformed and evangelical traditions.
