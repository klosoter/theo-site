# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches the doctrine of **divine decrees**—especially **election and reprobation**—from a Christocentric and eschatological perspective. He critiques classical **predestinarian** models, emphasizing the universal scope of God's salvific will and rooting election in the **Trinity** and the coming **kingdom of God**.

- "God does not will some to be saved and others to be damned, but wills all to be saved in the fellowship of Christ." ("The Church in the Power of the Spirit")

## Key Works

- "The Crucified God" (1972)
- "The Church in the Power of the Spirit" (1975)
- "The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology" (1995)
- "God in Creation" (1985)
- "The Trinity and the Kingdom" (1981)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Election is Christocentric**
    - Election is grounded in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ is both the electing God and the elected human.
    - The community of the elect is defined by participation in Christ’s mission.
    - Election is not about exclusion but about the opening of fellowship.
    - "In Christ, God has chosen all humanity for salvation." ("The Church in the Power of the Spirit")

2. **Rejection of Double Predestination**
    - Moltmann opposes the idea that God eternally decrees some to reprobation.
    - He views double predestination as incompatible with God’s love and justice.
    - Emphasizes the **universal scope** of God’s salvific will.
    - Reprobation is seen as self-exclusion from communion, not a divine decree.
    - "The doctrine of double predestination is a nightmare of the anxious conscience." ("The Coming of God")

3. **Eschatological Openness**
    - The future is genuinely open, not exhaustively predetermined by divine decree.
    - God’s promises invite human response and participation.
    - Election is oriented toward the coming **kingdom of God**.
    - Eschatology shapes the meaning and purpose of election.
    - "God’s election is the opening of the future, not its closure." ("The Coming of God")

4. **Trinitarian Foundation of Election**
    - Election is an act of the **triune God**, not an abstract decree.
    - The Father elects, the Son embodies election, and the Spirit actualizes it in history.
    - The **Trinity** ensures election is relational and communal.
    - Election reflects the dynamic love within the Godhead.
    - "The doctrine of election must be understood in the light of the Trinity." ("The Trinity and the Kingdom")

5. **Universal Scope of Salvation**
    - God’s will is the salvation of all, not merely a select few.
    - Election is inclusive, aiming at the reconciliation of all creation.
    - The church is a sign and instrument of this universal purpose.
    - Final judgment is subordinated to God’s redemptive intent.
    - "God’s election is the election of the world in Christ." ("The Church in the Power of the Spirit")

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s reimagining of **election and reprobation** has significantly influenced contemporary theology, especially in ecumenical and liberationist circles. His emphasis on the **universal salvific will of God** and the **Trinitarian** shape of election challenges traditional Reformed doctrines and invites ongoing dialogue. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire theologians seeking a more inclusive and hopeful vision of divine purpose.
