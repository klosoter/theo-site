# Peter Martyr Vermigli (1499–1562)

Peter Martyr Vermigli articulated a robust doctrine of the **divine decrees**, emphasizing God's sovereign and eternal will in both **election** and **reprobation**. He maintained that **predestination** is rooted in God's inscrutable wisdom and not contingent on human merit, distinguishing sharply between the elect, chosen in Christ for salvation, and the reprobate, passed over according to God's just judgment.

- "God does not elect or reprobate men because of their works, but according to his own purpose and will." (Loci Communes)

## Key Works

- Loci Communes (compiled posthumously from his biblical commentaries)
- Commentary on Romans
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians
- Theological Commonplaces (Loci Communes, English translation)
- Peter Martyr Vermigli and Predestination: The Augustinian Inheritance of an Italian Reformer (by Frank A. James III)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Predestination is rooted in God's eternal will**
    - God’s decree precedes all human actions and conditions.
    - Election and reprobation are not based on foreseen faith or works.
    - The divine will is the ultimate cause of salvation and condemnation.
    - God’s purposes are inscrutable but always just and wise.
    - "Predestination depends not on any human condition, but on the will and counsel of God." (Loci Communes)

2. **Election is unconditional and in Christ**
    - The elect are chosen solely by God’s mercy in Christ.
    - Christ is the foundation and means of election.
    - Election is not grounded in foreseen merit or faith.
    - The elect are effectually called and preserved by grace.
    - "Those who are elected are chosen in Christ, not for anything in themselves." (Commentary on Romans)

3. **Reprobation is a passing over, not active damnation**
    - Reprobation involves God’s decision to pass over some, leaving them in their sin.
    - God is not the author of sin, but permits the reprobate to follow their own desires.
    - The decree of reprobation is just, reflecting God’s holiness and righteousness.
    - Reprobation demonstrates God’s justice as election demonstrates His mercy.
    - "God’s reprobation is a just leaving of some in their corruption, not a causing of evil." (Loci Communes)

4. **Double predestination is affirmed but asymmetrical**
    - Both election and reprobation are included in the divine decree.
    - Election is an act of mercy; reprobation is an act of justice.
    - The two are not parallel: God actively saves, but only permits condemnation.
    - This distinction preserves God’s goodness and justice.
    - "God predestinates some to life by mercy, others he leaves to destruction by justice." (Commentary on Romans)

5. **Human responsibility is upheld within divine sovereignty**
    - God’s decree does not negate human accountability.
    - The reprobate are condemned for their own sin, not arbitrary decree.
    - The means of grace and proclamation of the gospel are genuinely offered.
    - Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are held in tension, not contradiction.
    - "Although God decrees all things, man is justly held responsible for his unbelief." (Loci Communes)

## Legacy and Impact

Vermigli’s articulation of the **divine decrees** significantly shaped the development of Reformed theology, especially in the doctrines of **election** and **reprobation**. His careful distinction between God’s active and passive roles in predestination influenced later theologians such as Calvin and the Reformed scholastics. Vermigli’s legacy endures in the confessional standards of the Reformed tradition, where his emphasis on God’s sovereignty and justice remains foundational.
