# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically reinterpreted the **divine decrees**, centering them on the person of **Jesus Christ** as both the electing God and the elected man. Rejecting the traditional **Reformed doctrine of double predestination**, Barth argued that **election** is fundamentally about God's gracious self-determination to be for humanity in Christ, while **reprobation** is subsumed under Christ's bearing of rejection on behalf of all.

- "In Jesus Christ God has chosen man for eternal life in such a way that He has also chosen Himself for rejection and death." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics II/2 (The Doctrine of God: The Election of God)
- Church Dogmatics IV/1 (The Doctrine of Reconciliation)
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- Karl Barth: A Biography (Eberhard Busch)
- The Humanity of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Election is Christocentric**
   - Jesus Christ is both the subject and object of **election**.
   - All divine decrees are centered in and revealed through Christ.
   - Election is not an abstract decree but God's concrete decision in Christ.
   - Christ embodies both the electing God and the elected man.
   - "Jesus Christ is both the electing God and elected man in one." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

2. **Rejection is borne by Christ**
   - **Reprobation** is not a separate decree for some individuals.
   - Christ takes upon Himself the rejection deserved by humanity.
   - The distinction between election and reprobation is resolved in Christ’s cross.
   - Human rejection is not ultimate; Christ’s bearing of it is.
   - "He takes the place of the rejected, and in this way He is Himself rejected." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

3. **Election is the revelation of grace**
   - Election is the self-determination of God to be gracious to humanity.
   - God’s will to save is prior to any human response or merit.
   - The decree is not hidden but revealed in the gospel.
   - Election is fundamentally good news, not a threat.
   - "The doctrine of election is the sum of the Gospel." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

4. **Rejection of double predestination as traditionally conceived**
   - Barth opposes the idea of an eternal decree of damnation for some.
   - He critiques the notion of a hidden, arbitrary will in God.
   - Election and reprobation are not parallel destinies for individuals.
   - The focus is on God’s mercy and universal scope in Christ.
   - "There is no decretum absolutum which is not the decree of grace." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

5. **Election as the ground of covenant and reconciliation**
   - Election establishes the **covenant** relationship between God and humanity.
   - It is the basis for reconciliation, not merely a metaphysical decree.
   - The covenant is fulfilled and secured in Christ’s person and work.
   - Election is the foundation for the church’s mission and hope.
   - "Election means the establishment of a covenant between God and man." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s doctrine of the **divine decrees** decisively shifted the conversation from abstract predestinarianism to a Christ-centered understanding of election and reprobation. His approach challenged both classical **Reformed orthodoxy** and modern liberalism, influencing subsequent debates on the nature of **grace**, **universalism**, and the scope of salvation. Barth’s emphasis on the centrality of Christ in election continues to shape contemporary theology and ecumenical dialogue.
