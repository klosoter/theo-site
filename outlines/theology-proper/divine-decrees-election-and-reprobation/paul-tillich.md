# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the doctrines of **divine decrees**, **election**, and **reprobation** through his existential and ontological framework, rejecting classical predestinarian formulations. For Tillich, **election** is not a matter of arbitrary divine will but is rooted in the universal offer of **grace** and the existential response of the individual to the **New Being** revealed in Christ. He reframed traditional doctrines in terms of **participation in being** and the **acceptance of acceptance**, emphasizing the existential dimension over deterministic categories.

- "The question of predestination is the question of the meaning of history and the destiny of man in the light of the divine ground of being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Existential Reinterpretation of Election**
   - Election is understood as the existential acceptance of **grace**, not a fixed decree.
   - The focus is on the individual's encounter with the **New Being** in Christ.
   - Election is universal in scope, offered to all through the **Christ-event**.
   - The existential response determines participation in the reality of salvation.
   - "Election is the acceptance of the accepted, the courage to accept oneself as accepted by God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Rejection of Double Predestination**
   - Tillich opposes the classical doctrine of **reprobation** as incompatible with the universal character of **grace**.
   - He sees double predestination as a distortion of the biblical message.
   - The concept of reprobation is replaced by the existential possibility of rejecting grace.
   - Divine judgment is real, but not grounded in an eternal decree of rejection.
   - "There is no divine decree of damnation; there is only the self-exclusion from the community of the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Divine Decrees as Symbolic**
   - The language of **decree** is symbolic, expressing the ultimate ground of history and destiny.
   - Tillich resists literal or mechanistic interpretations of divine will.
   - The decrees point to the depth dimension of reality, not to temporal events.
   - The symbolic nature preserves the mystery and freedom of both God and humanity.
   - "The divine decrees are symbols for the ultimate meaning and direction of history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Universal Offer of Grace**
   - Grace is universally present and active in all human existence.
   - Election does not imply exclusion but the possibility of actualizing one's being in Christ.
   - The universality of grace challenges exclusivist or deterministic readings of election.
   - Salvation is the fulfillment of the human potential for **New Being**.
   - "Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness... it transforms our situation." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

5. **Freedom and Responsibility in Salvation**
   - Human freedom is essential in responding to the divine offer of salvation.
   - The existential decision for or against grace is real and meaningful.
   - Responsibility is not negated by divine sovereignty but presupposed by it.
   - The dialectic of freedom and destiny shapes Tillich’s understanding of election.
   - "Man is asked to accept that he is accepted in spite of being unacceptable." (The Protestant Era)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **election** and **divine decrees** significantly influenced 20th-century theology, especially in the dialogue between **systematic theology** and existential philosophy. His rejection of deterministic predestination and emphasis on the **universal offer of grace** provided a framework for engaging modern concerns about freedom, responsibility, and the meaning of salvation. While his symbolic approach has been critiqued for lacking doctrinal precision, Tillich remains a pivotal figure in reshaping the conversation on divine sovereignty and human destiny.
