# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a classic **Reformed doctrine of the divine decrees**, emphasizing the absolute sovereignty of God in **election and reprobation**. He maintained that God's decrees are eternal, unconditional, and grounded solely in God's will, upholding the distinction between **predestination** to life and the passing over of the non-elect. Hodge defended these doctrines as both biblically warranted and essential to a robust **systematic theology**.

- "The decrees of God are his eternal purpose, according to the counsel of his own will, whereby, for his own glory, he hath foreordained whatsoever comes to pass." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons
- “Predestination” (Princeton Review articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty in Election**
    - Election is an act of God's free and sovereign will, not conditioned on foreseen faith or merit.
    - The elect are chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world.
    - Election is unto salvation and includes all means necessary for its accomplishment.
    - The basis of election is solely the good pleasure of God, not human response.
    - "Election, therefore, is not founded upon the foresight of faith or good works, but is sovereign and unconditional." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Reprobation as Passing Over**
    - Reprobation is not a positive act of predestining to damnation, but a passing over and withholding of saving grace.
    - God’s decree of reprobation is just, as all are fallen in Adam and deserving of condemnation.
    - The non-elect are left to their own sinful choices, which they freely make.
    - Reprobation demonstrates both God’s justice and the riches of his mercy to the elect.
    - "Reprobation is simply the act of passing by those whom God has not chosen to save." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Decrees are Eternal and Immutable**
    - God’s decrees are from eternity and do not change in response to human actions.
    - The decrees encompass all things, including the means and ends of salvation.
    - There is no succession or sequence in God’s decrees; they are one eternal act.
    - The certainty of the decrees does not negate human responsibility.
    - "The decrees of God are immutable; they are not dependent on the mutable will of man." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Compatibility of Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - Human choices are real and morally significant within God’s sovereign plan.
    - God’s foreordination does not coerce or violate the will of creatures.
    - The doctrine upholds both divine sovereignty and the genuine offer of the gospel.
    - The mystery of concurrence is affirmed, not explained away.
    - "The sovereignty of God is not inconsistent with the liberty and responsibility of man." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Biblical and Confessional Foundations**
    - The doctrine is grounded in Scripture, especially Romans 9 and Ephesians 1.
    - Hodge appeals to the Westminster Confession as a faithful summary of biblical teaching.
    - He insists that predestination is a doctrine of grace, not fatalism.
    - The decrees are ultimately for the manifestation of God’s glory.
    - "The Scriptures everywhere refer the salvation of men to the purpose of God." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **election and reprobation** became a standard reference for American Presbyterian and Reformed theology, shaping generations of pastors and theologians at Princeton and beyond. His careful defense of the **sovereignty of God** and the compatibility of divine decrees with human responsibility remains influential in contemporary discussions of predestination. Hodge’s work continues to be cited for its clarity, biblical fidelity, and confessional rigor.
