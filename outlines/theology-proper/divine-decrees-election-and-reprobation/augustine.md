# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **divine decrees**—especially **election** and **reprobation**—emphasizes the absolute sovereignty of **God’s will** in the salvation and condemnation of humanity. He insists that **predestination** is rooted in God’s eternal purpose, not in foreseen merit, and that **grace** is both necessary and irresistible for the elect, while the reprobate are justly left in their sin.

- "For not all men are called, but those who are called are called according to God’s purpose." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Predestination is rooted in God’s sovereign will**
    - God’s choice of the elect is not based on foreseen faith or merit.
    - The decree of election is eternal and unchangeable.
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of salvation.
    - Human beings cannot know the reasons for God’s choices.
    - "He chooses not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

2. **Grace is necessary and irresistible for the elect**
    - Fallen humanity is utterly dependent on divine grace for salvation.
    - The elect receive an effectual call that cannot be resisted.
    - Grace precedes and enables any human response.
    - The gift of perseverance is granted only to the elect.
    - "For it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure." (Enchiridion)

3. **Reprobation is a just consequence of sin**
    - God passes over some, leaving them in their justly deserved condemnation.
    - The reprobate are not made evil by God but are left to their own sinful wills.
    - God’s justice is vindicated in the punishment of the reprobate.
    - There is no injustice with God in the decree of reprobation.
    - "Those who are not liberated are justly condemned, because they are not innocent." (On the Gift of Perseverance)

4. **Election is unconditional and gracious**
    - God’s election is not based on any foreseen act or decision by the individual.
    - Salvation is entirely a matter of divine mercy.
    - The elect are chosen out of the mass of fallen humanity.
    - Faith itself is a gift given only to the elect.
    - "He has mercy on whom He will, and whom He will He hardens." (City of God)

5. **The mystery of God’s will must be humbly accepted**
    - Human reason cannot fully comprehend God’s decrees.
    - The distinction between the elect and reprobate is ultimately inscrutable.
    - Believers are called to trust in God’s goodness and wisdom.
    - The doctrine should lead to humility, not presumption or despair.
    - "O man, who are you to answer back to God?" (On the Predestination of the Saints)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **predestination** and the **divine decrees** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, especially within the Augustinian and later Reformed traditions. His emphasis on the primacy of **grace** and the sovereignty of God’s will influenced medieval theology and the Protestant Reformers. Debates over election and reprobation in both Catholic and Protestant circles often return to Augustine’s formulations as a foundational reference point.
