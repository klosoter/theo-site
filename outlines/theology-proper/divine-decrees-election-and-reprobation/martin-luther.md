# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of the **divine decrees**—particularly **election** and **reprobation**—emphasizes the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation, while maintaining the centrality of **justification by faith**. Luther affirms **unconditional election** and the inscrutability of God’s will, yet he resists speculative theology that would undermine the assurance of the believer or the proclamation of the **gospel**.

- "For God has surely promised His grace to the humbled, that is, to those who lament and despair of themselves." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Key Works

- The Bondage of the Will (De Servo Arbitrio)

- Luther’s Works, Vol. 33: Career of the Reformer III
- Table Talk
- Luther’s Preface to the Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sovereignty of God’s Will**
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of **election** and **reprobation**.
    - Human will is bound and cannot resist or cooperate apart from divine action.
    - The decrees of God are hidden and not subject to human scrutiny.
    - God’s purposes are always righteous, even when inscrutable.
    - "God does not lie, nor is He deceived, even though He may seem to us to do so." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Unconditional Election**
    - Election is not based on foreseen faith or merit.
    - God freely chooses whom He will save according to His own good pleasure.
    - The elect are drawn irresistibly to Christ by the Spirit.
    - Assurance of election is found in Christ alone, not in speculation.
    - "For if you believe, you are elect; if you do not believe, you are not elect." (Lectures on Romans)

3. **Reprobation and the Hiddenness of God**
    - Reprobation is the counterpart to election, rooted in God’s hidden will.
    - Luther warns against probing the mystery of reprobation beyond Scripture.
    - The gospel is to be preached universally, leaving the outcome to God.
    - The hidden God (Deus absconditus) is distinguished from the revealed God in Christ.
    - "Let God be God, and let man humble himself before Him." (The Bondage of the Will)

4. **Justification by Faith and Assurance**
    - Assurance comes from faith in Christ, not from knowledge of the decrees.
    - The doctrine of election serves to comfort believers, not to terrify.
    - Faith clings to the promises of God revealed in the gospel.
    - The believer is called to look to Christ, not to the hidden counsel of God.
    - "We must look to the Word and leave the secret will of God alone." (Table Talk)

5. **Pastoral Use of the Doctrine**
    - The doctrine is meant to humble sinners and exalt God’s grace.
    - Election is proclaimed to encourage faith and repentance.
    - Speculation about reprobation is discouraged as spiritually dangerous.
    - The focus remains on Christ as the ground of hope and assurance.
    - "Preach Christ to all, and let God decide who will hear and believe." (Luther’s Works, Vol. 33)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s teaching on **divine election** and reprobation shaped the trajectory of Protestant thought, especially in emphasizing the **sovereignty of God** and the necessity of faith. His caution against speculative theology and his focus on the revealed promises in Christ influenced later Lutheran and Reformed traditions. While Luther’s views on reprobation were less systematized than later Reformed theologians, his insistence on the hiddenness and freedom of God remains a hallmark of his theology. His pastoral concern for assurance and the centrality of the gospel continues to resonate in discussions of predestination.
