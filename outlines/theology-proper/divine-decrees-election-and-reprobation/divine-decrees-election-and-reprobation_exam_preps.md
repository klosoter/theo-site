### ESSAY
The doctrine of the **divine decree**, and specifically of **election** and **reprobation**, is an attempt to speak in a disciplined way about how the eternal, simple, immutable will of God stands behind the history of salvation and judgment without nullifying the reality of means, decisions, and contingencies in time. At its core, the Reformed doctrine claims that before the foundation of the world God, according to the counsel of his own will, freely and unchangeably decreed whatsoever comes to pass, and that within that one simple decree he chose some fallen sinners to salvation in Christ and passed by others, ordaining them to just condemnation for their sins. The theological task is to defend this claim in a manner coherent with **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, **holiness**, and a robust doctrine of human responsibility, while resisting both Pelagian synergism and fatalistic determinism.

The classic trajectory begins with Augustine, whose anti-Pelagian work sets the central grammar. In his earlier writings Augustine speaks of predestination mainly as God’s foreknowledge of those who will believe, but in his later anti-Pelagian phase, especially in On the Predestination of the Saints and On the Gift of Perseverance, he explicitly grounds predestination in God’s effective will. Salvation is entirely due to the gratuitous **grace of God** that not only offers but infallibly gives faith and perseverance to the elect. Augustine insists that all humanity is a “mass of perdition,” justly condemned in Adam. From that massa damnata God mercifully rescues some by giving them the gift of faith and perseverance, while leaving the rest in their justly deserved misery. This is already the seed of both unconditional election and what later Reformed theology will call **reprobation** as preterition and condemnation.

Augustine’s decisive methodological move is to locate the difference between the elect and the non-elect not in foreseen use of free will but solely in the inscrutable good pleasure of God. “Why he draws one and not another, do not seek to judge if you do not wish to err,” he says. Yet he also insists on genuine human culpability: reprobates sin willingly, and God’s hardening is a just judgment upon their own evil desires. Here the basic compatibilist structure emerges: God’s will is the ultimate, infallible cause of all that comes to pass, yet human choices are real, voluntary, and morally assessable because they flow from the agent’s own desires. Internal Augustinian debates already appear: some, troubled by the harshness of massa damnata, press toward a more synergistic account of grace; others radicalize Augustine into a near-fatalist. Examiners will ask whether Augustine teaches “double predestination.” The careful answer is that he clearly teaches a positive predestination to life and a leaving of others to their just doom, and that he attributes unbelief to the sinner’s will, but he does not yet systematize reprobation in the later Reformed sense.

Thomas Aquinas receives Augustine and subjects him to a more explicit metaphysical analysis. In the Summa Theologiae, especially in the questions on providence and predestination, Aquinas insists that God is the first cause of all things, including free acts, by universal causality. Because of **divine simplicity**, the decree of God is identical with the divine essence; there is not a sequence of discrete decisions in God but one simple eternal act that contains in a differentiated way the order of all things. Aquinas defines predestination as the ordering of rational creatures to their ultimate end, eternal life, and reprobation as God’s will to permit some to fall into sin and incur punishment. Predestination includes both the end and the infallibly ordained means: the elect are given grace that moves the will without destroying it, in such a way that they freely consent. Reprobation, by contrast, is asymmetrical: God wills not to give certain graces, to permit sin, and to inflict just punishment.

Aquinas’s decisive contribution is to frame predestination and reprobation in terms of God as universal cause and to protect both sides of the relation: God truly and efficaciously causes the good, while he only permits evil and ordains its punishment. This asymmetry is crucial. When examiners press whether God “causes” sin in the reprobate, the Thomistic and classical Reformed answer is that God is the first cause of the act of the will as act, but not of the defect or disorder in that act which constitutes sin. That defect arises from the finite will as dependent and defective; God’s involvement is a permission that is itself wise and just. The external debate with semi-Pelagianism shows up around the question of conditionality: Aquinas emphatically denies that predestination is based on foreseen merit. Any good foreseen is already the effect of predestinating grace. On this he is a true Augustinian. Yet his willingness to speak of God’s “conditional” will for the salvation of all, and of sufficient grace given to all, provided later Catholic theologians with resources for moderating the harder edges of Augustine, leading to internal debates between Thomists and Molinists over the mode of God’s knowledge of free contingents.

The Reformation intensifies the issue by tying it directly to the doctrine of justification and the bondage of the will. Luther famously attacks the idea of a neutral human will in The Bondage of the Will, insisting that fallen human beings are, in moral and spiritual matters, in bondage either to sin or to grace. Yet Luther is less systematic about the decree itself than Calvin, whose Institutes and sermons on Ephesians 1 set the terms for later **Reformed orthodoxy**. Calvin insists that predestination is not a peripheral speculation but a teaching embedded in the gospel of grace: if salvation is by grace alone, then it must ultimately rest on God’s eternal election, not on human choice. He defines election as God’s eternal, free, immutable choice of some to salvation in Christ. Reprobation he understands as God’s just decree to pass by others, leaving them in their fall, and to ordain them to condemnation for their sins. In this sense, he affirms a form of double predestination, but he is careful to distinguish the mode: grace is the cause of the elect’s faith and salvation, while sin is the proper cause of the reprobates’ damnation.

Calvin’s decisive contribution lies in crystallizing several lines of thought into a coherent pattern. First, he more explicitly situates election and reprobation within the one comprehensive **decree of God** that encompasses all things, resisting any partition between a “general” decree and a separate “decree of salvation.” Second, he tightens the relation between the decree and Christ: election is “in Christ,” such that Christ is both the foundation and mirror of election. Third, Calvin connects election with the pastoral matter of assurance. Believers, he argues, ought not to pry into the secret counsel of God in the abstract, but to behold their election in Christ offered in the gospel and sealed by the Spirit. This is a crucial examiner point: does the doctrine of election lead to despair and speculation, or to humble confidence? Calvin’s position is that rightly handled, election grounds assurance by placing salvation entirely outside the believer’s fluctuating performance and in God’s immutable purpose.

Internal Reformed debates spring up quickly. One concerns the order of the decree in relation to the fall, often labeled supralapsarian and infralapsarian. Both affirm unconditional election and a real decree of reprobation, and both insist that in God the decree is one simple act. The question is a matter of logical order as we conceive it. The supralapsarian view reasons that God first wills his own glory in the salvation of some and the damnation of others, then wills to create them and permit the fall as the means to that end. Infralapsarianism, by contrast, conceives God as first willing to create and permit the fall, and only then, from that fallen mass, electing some and leaving others. I defend a classic infralapsarian position, not because it rescues God from difficult questions but because it better matches the scriptural order and the asymmetry taught by Augustine and Aquinas. Scripture consistently speaks of election of those who are “by nature children of wrath” and reprobation as God’s just leaving and condemning sinners for their sins. When examiners ask whether supralapsarianism implies that God positively intends sin as such for the sake of damnation, the infralapsarian answer is to stress that sin is never a mere instrument but always an evil God hates, even as he permits it and orders it for his glory.

Francis Turretin represents the mature scholastic articulation of Reformed **federal theology** and predestinarian doctrine. In his Institutes of Elenctic Theology he develops a careful ordo decretorum and a rigorous distinction between election, preterition, and reprobation. Turretin insists that the decree is eternal, free, and immutable, and he grounds it in **divine simplicity** and **omniscience**. Crucially, he refines the asymmetry of election and reprobation. Election is an act of the divine good pleasure choosing some to life and providing Christ and faith as means. Reprobation includes preterition, God’s will not to give saving grace to some, and condemnation, his will to punish them for sin. Turretin labors to show that God is not the author of sin: preterition does not infuse evil into the reprobate but simply withholds special grace, while ordinary concursus sustains them as agents whose own evil desires generate sinful acts.

Turretin also faces internal Reformed tensions especially on the free offer of the gospel and the relation of the decree to the covenant of grace. If God has from eternity willed that some will not be saved, can he sincerely call all to repentance? Turretin answers by distinguishing God’s **will of decree** from his **will of precept**. According to his preceptive will, God delights in righteousness and commands all to repent and believe; the external call is genuine and well meant. According to his decretive will, God has particular purposes in that call: to bring the elect to faith and to render the reprobate inexcusable. This distinction, rooted already in Augustine and Aquinas, aims to preserve both universal gospel preaching and particular election. Examiners may probe whether this distinction fractures the unity of God’s will. The response must be metaphysical: the will in God is one and simple, but we distinguish diverse relations of that will to different objects. The precept and the decree are not competing volitions in God but different aspects of one wise plan.

Against this Augustinian–Reformed stream stands Jacob Arminius and the Remonstrant movement, forming the key external synergistic challenge within Protestantism. Arminius, originally trained in Reformed circles, becomes convinced that the received doctrine of unconditional election makes God the author of sin and destroys meaningful human freedom. In his Declaration of Sentiments and related writings, he redefines election as conditional: God from eternity decrees to save all who will believe in Christ and persevere to the end. God’s decree is thus general and conditional, not particular and absolute. Grace is necessary and prior, but Arminius insists on **prevenient grace** given to all, restoring a measure of ability so that any may respond. Election as such is grounded in foreknowledge: God knows who will freely respond to grace, and he decrees to save them. Reprobation is not a positive decree to pass by some but God’s foreknowledge of those who will resist grace and persevere in unbelief.

Arminius introduces a different view of freedom: what later discussions will label libertarian freedom. On this model, for human choices to be responsible and morally significant, they must be undetermined by prior causes in a way that allows for genuine alternative possibilities. Arminian critics of Reformed predestination argue that if God’s decree infallibly determines who will believe, then those who do not believe could not do otherwise and thus cannot be justly condemned. Reformed theology responds with a compatibilist account: freedom consists not in indeterminacy but in acting voluntarily in line with one’s strongest motives and desires. On this view, reprobates sin freely because they want to, not because they are coerced. Their inability is moral, not metaphysical; they “cannot” come because they will not. Examiners will press whether compatibilism collapses responsibility into divine causality. The answer is that on classical theism, God’s causality is at a different order than creaturely causality. God as first cause works through second causes in such a way that his efficacy does not compete with the creature’s genuine agency but grounds it.

Modern external challenges intensify these questions by attacking the very notion of an eternal **decree of God**. Open theism, for instance, denies exhaustive divine foreknowledge of future free acts in order to preserve libertarian freedom and to protect God from being implicated in evil. Process theology goes further, rejecting divine immutability and omnipotence. From these perspectives, the doctrine of unconditional election and reprobation is morally repugnant and metaphysically incoherent. The Reformed response must begin by insisting on the non-negotiable attributes of classical theism. To give up exhaustive, definite divine foreknowledge and the **immutability** and **simplicity** of God is to abandon the God of Scripture. Election and reprobation are difficult, but they at least face the problem of evil within a framework where God is truly Lord of history. In open and process views, evil slips outside his definitive control, jeopardizing any ultimate assurance that God will finally defeat it.

Contemporary evangelical revisions often try to retain some form of election while softening reprobation. Proposals of “corporate election” argue that God elects Christ and in him a corporate body, the church, rather than particular individuals. Individuals become elect by freely choosing to enter the elect community by faith. Others attempt “single predestination,” asserting a positive decree of election but denying any decretive relation to reprobation. Westminster-style examiners will push here: can you have a robust particular election without some correlative doctrine of reprobation? The classical Reformed answer is no. If God from eternity chooses some and effectively brings them to faith, then he necessarily does not choose others in that way. Non-election is not mere contingency; it is encompassed in the decree. The insistence on an asymmetrical double predestination, however, remains vital: God’s decree actively and positively gives grace to the elect; he does not infuse evil into the reprobate but passes them by and ordains them to just punishment for their sins.

The doctrine must finally be tested against the loci of Christology, soteriology, and providence. Election is “in Christ.” This not only means Christ is the mediator through whom salvation is applied to the elect, but that the very decree of election has a Christological center: God wills from eternity to glorify his Son as the head of a redeemed humanity. This guards against a bare decretalism. Calvin and Turretin insist that election is not a naked choice of individuals but a choice of them in union with Christ, under the covenant of grace. Reprobation, correspondingly, is not outside Christ’s lordship, for the Son is appointed judge of the living and the dead, and his judicial office includes the just condemnation of the impenitent. To detach election and reprobation from Christ is to drift into an abstract metaphysical determinism.

Soteriologically, unconditional election protects the monergistic structure of salvation by **grace alone**. Faith itself is the gift of God, purchased by Christ and bestowed by the Spirit on those given to the Son by the Father. If election were conditioned on foreseen faith, the ultimate ground of salvation would lie in something in the sinner, undermining the radicality of grace. At the same time, the decree works through means: preaching, sacraments, prayer, and perseverance. Here the charge of fatalism is rebutted most concretely. The Reformed understanding of **providence** is that God ordains not only the end but the necessary means to that end. When Paul says, “I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus,” he does not reason that election makes evangelism unnecessary. Rather, election ensures that evangelism will be fruitful. Far from paralyzing missions, the doctrine emboldens it: God has many people in this city.

Pastorally, election and reprobation raise acute questions of assurance and the free offer. Can a believer know he is elect? The Reformed answer is yes, but not by prying into the secret decree. One knows election by looking to Christ in the gospel, trusting his promise, and seeing in oneself the fruits of the Spirit as evidences of God’s work. Election thus undergirds assurance by directing the gaze away from the volatility of human will to the steadfast purpose of God. Regarding the free offer, can the preacher sincerely say to every hearer, “Christ died for you”? Strictly speaking, classic particularism hesitates to make that exact formulation, preferring “Christ is offered to you; if you repent and believe, you will certainly be saved.” Yet the preacher can and must say that God, in the revealed will of his precept, genuinely commands all to repent and promises salvation to all who come. The hidden decree does not undermine the genuineness of the call.

The hardest objection concerns the goodness of God. How can a good God decree from eternity to pass by some, knowing infallibly that they will be lost? Here the Reformed tradition takes its stand on **divine sovereignty** and **wisdom**. God has the right over his creatures as the potter over the clay. Out of a race justly fallen in Adam, he owes mercy to none. That he saves any is sheer mercy; that he leaves some is strict justice. The mystery lies not in why some are reprobate but why any are elect. Paul himself, in Romans 9, anticipates the charge of injustice and does not resolve it by appealing to foreseen faith but by asserting God’s right to have mercy on whom he will and to harden whom he will. At the same time, the doctrine affirms that God has morally sufficient reasons, though not fully revealed, for his decree. His ultimate aim is the manifestation of his glory in both mercy and justice. The Arminian protests that this makes persons mere means to an end. The Reformed response is that in God’s ordering, his glory and the genuine good of his creatures are not in competition. The blessedness of the elect and the just punishment of the wicked are both aspects of a cosmos wisely ordered to the disclosure of divine perfections.

In defending an infralapsarian, unconditional election with asymmetrical reprobation, one must continually hold together several anchors: the unity and simplicity of the **divine decree**, the integrity of human responsibility under a compatibilist account of freedom, the Christological center of election, and the pastoral end of the doctrine for assurance and zeal in holiness and mission. The alternatives, whether Pelagian, semi-Pelagian, Arminian, open theist, or process, in various ways compromise either the sovereignty of God, the fullness of grace, or the certainty of God’s eschatological victory. The classic Augustinian–Reformed doctrine does not remove mystery, but it locates that mystery within the worship of the God whose judgments are unsearchable and whose ways are past tracing out, and thus gives the church a stable confession from which to preach, pray, and persevere.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The **divine decree** is God’s eternal, simple, immutable will whereby he freely and wisely determines all that comes to pass; within that decree, **election** is God’s unconditional choice of some fallen sinners in Christ unto salvation, and **reprobation** is his just passing by others and ordaining them to condemnation for their sins in an asymmetrical manner.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: massa damnata, unconditional grace, embryonic double predestination with strong emphasis on divine inscrutability and human culpability.
  - Thomas Aquinas: predestination and reprobation within **divine simplicity** and universal causality, asymmetry of God causing good and permitting evil.
  - John Calvin: Christocentric, pastoral articulation of election and reprobation, double predestination with insistence on assurance and the free offer.
  - Francis Turretin: mature Reformed scholastic development, precise distinctions in election, preterition, condemnation, and will of decree vs will of precept.
  - Jacob Arminius: conditional, foreknowledge-based election, universal prevenient grace, libertarian freedom, rejection of unconditional reprobation.
- Debates:
  - Internal: supralapsarian vs infralapsarian order of the decree, scope and mode of reprobation, relation of decree to covenant and free offer.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian synergism, Arminian conditional election and libertarian freedom, Molinist middle knowledge, open theism and process denials of exhaustive decree.
  - Contemporary: accusations of determinism and divine moral monstrosity, problem of evil and hell, corporate vs individual election, single vs double predestination, pastoral use for assurance and missions.
- Defended position: Classic Reformed, infralapsarian, unconditional election and asymmetrical reprobation within one wise, good, and comprehensive **decree of God**, affirming **compatibilist freedom**, **divine simplicity**, Christ-centered election, and the sincere free offer of the gospel.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Does unconditional election make God the author of sin? No, because God is first cause of the act as act but only permits the defect of sin, which arises from the finite will, and he ordains sin’s punishment in justice.
  - Is double predestination symmetrical? No, election is a positive bestowal of grace causing faith, while reprobation is preterition and just condemnation for sin; God does not infuse evil.
  - Why prefer infralapsarianism? Because it reflects the scriptural order that God elects and passes by those already viewed as fallen and underscores the asymmetry of mercy and justice.
  - How is the free offer sincere if not all are decreed to be saved? Because God’s **will of precept** truly commands and invites all to repent with a genuine promise, even as his **will of decree** has specific purposes in that call.
  - Does this doctrine undermine human responsibility? No, since on compatibilism responsibility requires voluntary action flowing from one’s desires, not indeterministic power to the contrary, and God’s first causality upholds rather than cancels creaturely agency.
