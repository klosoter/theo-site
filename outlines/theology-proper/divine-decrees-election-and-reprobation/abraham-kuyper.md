# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper articulated a robust doctrine of the **divine decrees**, emphasizing God's absolute sovereignty in **election** and **reprobation**. He maintained that God's eternal will unconditionally determines the destiny of every individual, grounding **predestination** in God's sovereign good pleasure rather than foreseen faith or merit.

- "Election and reprobation both rest in the absolute sovereignty of God, who works all things according to the counsel of His will." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

## Key Works

- Dictaten Dogmatiek (Dogmatics Lectures)
- De Gemeene Gratie (Common Grace)
- Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology
- Lectures on Calvinism
- "Calvinism and Confessionalism" (in various essays and speeches)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sovereignty of God in Election**
    - Election is rooted solely in God's sovereign will, not in human response or foreseen faith.
    - The decree of election is eternal, unchangeable, and particular.
    - God's choice precedes and determines all human history and salvation.
    - Election is the fountainhead of all redemptive blessings.
    - "The election is not based on anything in man, but only in the sovereign good pleasure of God." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

2. **Double Predestination**
    - Kuyper affirms both election and reprobation as distinct but parallel aspects of the divine decree.
    - Reprobation is not symmetrical with election; it is a decree of passing by, not active damnation.
    - Both decrees serve to manifest God's justice and mercy.
    - The decree of reprobation is equally sovereign and unconditional.
    - "God’s decree of reprobation is not an act of injustice, but of sovereign righteousness." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

3. **Infralapsarian Order**
    - Kuyper adopts the infralapsarian position, placing the decree to permit the fall before election and reprobation.
    - This order preserves God's justice and the reality of human responsibility.
    - Election and reprobation presuppose fallen humanity as their object.
    - The infralapsarian order avoids making God the author of sin.
    - "The infralapsarian arrangement best safeguards both divine sovereignty and human accountability." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

4. **Covenantal Context of Election**
    - Election is realized in history through the covenant community.
    - The visible church contains both elect and non-elect members.
    - Covenant promises are administered broadly, but only the elect receive saving grace.
    - The covenant serves as the historical means for the outworking of election.
    - "The covenant is the field in which election is revealed and realized." (De Gemeene Gratie)

5. **Pastoral Implications of Election**
    - The doctrine of election is intended to comfort believers, not to foster speculation.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ and the promises of the gospel, not in introspection.
    - Preaching should call all to faith and repentance, trusting God to gather His elect.
    - Election motivates humility, gratitude, and evangelistic zeal.
    - "The certainty of election should lead to humility and praise, not pride or despair." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s articulation of **divine sovereignty** in election and reprobation shaped Dutch Reformed theology and influenced the Neo-Calvinist movement. His careful distinction between election and reprobation, along with his infralapsarian ordering, provided a nuanced alternative to both supralapsarianism and Arminianism. Kuyper’s legacy endures in Reformed confessionalism, pastoral theology, and ongoing debates about the relationship between **covenant** and election.
