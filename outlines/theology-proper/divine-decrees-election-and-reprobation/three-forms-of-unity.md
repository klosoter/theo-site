# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—offer a comprehensive and confessional articulation of the **divine decrees**, especially regarding **election** and **reprobation**. These documents affirm that God’s **eternal decree** is the foundation of salvation, emphasizing **unconditional election** and the just, sovereign nature of **reprobation**. The Canons of Dort, in particular, respond to Arminian objections by defending the Reformed understanding of **predestination**.

- "Election is the unchangeable purpose of God whereby, before the foundation of the world, He has out of mere grace, according to the sovereign good pleasure of His own will, chosen...certain persons to redemption in Christ." (Canons of Dort I.7)

## Key Works

- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. First Head of Doctrine: Divine Election and Reprobation
- Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 16–17
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), Q&A 20–22, 54, 52
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- Saving the Reformation: The Pastoral Theology of the Canons of Dort (W. Robert Godfrey)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Election is unconditional and rooted in God’s sovereign will**
    - Election is not based on foreseen faith or merit in the individual.
    - God’s choice is made from eternity, before the foundation of the world.
    - The ground of election is solely God’s mercy in Christ.
    - Election is immutable and leads infallibly to salvation.
    - "This elect number, though by nature neither better nor more deserving than others, God has decreed to give to Christ to be saved." (Canons of Dort I.7)

2. **Reprobation is a just act of God’s sovereignty**
    - Reprobation is the decree by which God passes by some, leaving them in their sin.
    - It is not arbitrary but grounded in God’s justice and wisdom.
    - The decree of reprobation does not make God the author of sin.
    - Those reprobated are justly condemned for their unbelief and sin.
    - "Others are passed by in the eternal decree, whom God...leaves in the common misery into which they have willfully plunged themselves." (Canons of Dort I.15)

3. **Christ is the means and mediator of election**
    - Election is always in Christ, the appointed Mediator.
    - The elect are united to Christ by faith, which is itself a gift.
    - Christ’s atonement is effectual for the elect alone.
    - The decree of election includes the means of salvation, not just the end.
    - "He has chosen us in Christ before the foundation of the world." (Belgic Confession, Art. 16)

4. **The preaching of the gospel is the means by which the elect are called**
    - The external call of the gospel is genuinely offered to all.
    - The Spirit effectually calls and regenerates the elect through the Word.
    - The non-elect may hear the call but remain hardened by their own unbelief.
    - The means of grace are ordained by God to accomplish His decree.
    - "As many as are called by the gospel are earnestly called...but many, being called, do not come." (Canons of Dort III/IV.8)

5. **Assurance and humility flow from the doctrine of election**
    - The doctrine of election provides comfort and assurance to believers.
    - It fosters humility, gratitude, and praise to God’s sovereign grace.
    - The elect are exhorted to make their calling and election sure by holy living.
    - The doctrine is not meant to lead to despair or presumption.
    - "This doctrine affords unspeakable consolation to the pious and holy." (Canons of Dort I.12)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the **divine decrees**, especially in the areas of **election** and **reprobation**. Their careful distinctions and pastoral tone provided a confessional standard that countered Arminianism and clarified the Reformed position for subsequent generations. These documents continue to serve as authoritative doctrinal standards in many Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring the ongoing influence of their robust, Christ-centered doctrine of predestination.
