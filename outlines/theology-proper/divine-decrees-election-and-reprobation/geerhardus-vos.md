# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated a robustly **Reformed doctrine of the divine decrees**, emphasizing the absolute sovereignty of God in **election and reprobation**. He maintained that God's decrees are eternal, unconditional, and grounded solely in God's will, not foreseen faith or merit, and that **predestination** is central to the outworking of **redemptive history**.

- "The decree of election is not based upon foreseen faith or good works, but solely upon the sovereign good pleasure of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- The Pauline Eschatology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Doctrine of Election" (in various lectures and essays)
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Love of God" (Presbyterian and Reformed Review)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Decrees Are Eternal and Unchangeable**
   - The divine decrees are established before creation and are not subject to alteration.
   - God’s will is the ultimate ground for all that happens in history.
   - The decrees encompass all things, including both **election** and **reprobation**.
   - Human history unfolds according to God’s predetermined plan.
   - "The decrees of God are not temporal acts, but eternal determinations." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Election Is Unconditional and Particular**
   - Election is not based on foreseen faith, works, or any human condition.
   - God chooses individuals to salvation out of His mere good pleasure.
   - Election is particular, not general or universal.
   - The elect are given grace and faith as a result of God’s sovereign choice.
   - "Election is the fountain of every saving good, the cause of faith, not its result." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Reprobation Is Sovereign and Just**
   - Reprobation is the passing over of some in God’s decree, leaving them in their sin.
   - It is not arbitrary but grounded in God’s justice and wisdom.
   - Reprobation serves to display God’s justice as election displays His mercy.
   - The decree of reprobation is as sovereign as that of election, though its ground differs.
   - "Reprobation is not a positive act of condemnation apart from sin, but a sovereign passing by." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

4. **Christ as the Mediator of the Elect**
   - Christ’s mediatorial work is intended for the elect alone.
   - The atonement is particular and effectual, securing salvation for those chosen.
   - The covenant of grace is administered to the elect through Christ.
   - The work of Christ is the means by which the decree of election is realized in history.
   - "The work of Christ is particular in its intent and effect, securing the salvation of the elect." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

5. **Redemptive History Unfolds the Divine Decrees**
   - The history of redemption is the progressive realization of God’s eternal plan.
   - Election and reprobation are worked out in the unfolding of biblical history.
   - The covenant structure of Scripture reflects the outworking of the decrees.
   - Vos’s biblical-theological method highlights the organic unity of God’s plan.
   - "The history of redemption is nothing other than the execution of the eternal counsel of God." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **divine decrees** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in the areas of **covenant theology** and biblical theology. His insistence on the sovereignty of God in election and reprobation has influenced generations of theologians at Westminster and beyond. By integrating systematic and biblical theology, Vos provided a framework for understanding predestination as central to the drama of redemption. His legacy endures in both academic and ecclesiastical contexts, reinforcing the centrality of God’s sovereign grace in salvation.
