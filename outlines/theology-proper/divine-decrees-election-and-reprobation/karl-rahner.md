# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the doctrines of **divine decrees**, **election**, and **reprobation** through the lens of his transcendental theology, emphasizing the universal salvific will of God and the mystery of human freedom. He reinterpreted traditional notions of **predestination** by focusing on the existential openness of every person to God's self-communication, while rejecting a double predestination to damnation. Rahner’s perspective sought to uphold both the gratuity of **grace** and the seriousness of human response within the context of **God’s universal salvific will**.

- "We must not think of predestination and reprobation as two parallel divine decrees, but as the one will of God to save all men, which is accepted or rejected in freedom." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Universal Salvific Will of God**
    - God genuinely wills the salvation of all people, not just a predestined few.
    - Election is rooted in the universal offer of **grace** through Christ.
    - The distinction between the elect and the non-elect is not based on an arbitrary divine decree.
    - Human freedom is respected within the context of God’s universal salvific intention.
    - "God’s will to save is universal and precedes any human response." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Double Predestination**
    - Rahner opposes the idea that God positively wills the damnation of anyone.
    - Reprobation is understood as the result of free rejection of grace, not a parallel decree to election.
    - The mystery of human freedom is preserved alongside divine sovereignty.
    - The Church must not teach that anyone is positively predestined to be lost.
    - "There is no parallelism between election and reprobation in the will of God." (Theological Investigations IV)

3. **Existential Openness to Grace**
    - Every person is constituted as a "hearer of the Word," open to God’s self-communication.
    - Election is realized existentially in the acceptance of grace.
    - The possibility of salvation is present even for those outside explicit Christian faith.
    - Human response to grace is always a free, personal act.
    - "Every man is, by his very existence, the subject of a supernatural existential." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Christocentric Predestination**
    - All predestination is in view of Christ, the "primordial sacrament" of God’s self-giving.
    - Election is not an abstract decree but is concretely realized in Christ.
    - The Church is the sacramental sign of God’s electing will in history.
    - The universality of Christ’s mediation grounds the universality of election.
    - "All men are predestined in Christ, who is the center of salvation history." (Theological Investigations I)

5. **Mystery and Humility in Theological Speculation**
    - The doctrines of election and reprobation must be approached with humility before the mystery of God.
    - Human concepts cannot fully grasp the depths of divine freedom and mercy.
    - Theological formulations should avoid presumption about the fate of individuals.
    - The Church’s teaching should foster hope in God’s mercy for all.
    - "We must leave the mystery of salvation and damnation in the hands of God." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s reinterpretation of **election** and **reprobation** has profoundly shaped modern Catholic theology, especially in the context of Vatican II’s emphasis on the universal call to salvation. His insistence on the **universal salvific will of God** and the existential openness of every person to grace has influenced ecumenical dialogues and broadened the Church’s understanding of predestination. Rahner’s thought continues to challenge theologians to hold together divine initiative, human freedom, and the mystery of salvation with humility and hope.
