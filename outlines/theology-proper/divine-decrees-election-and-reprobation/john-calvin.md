# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of the **divine decrees** is foundational to his theology, emphasizing God’s absolute sovereignty in **election** and **reprobation**. He taught that before the foundation of the world, God freely and unchangeably ordained some to **eternal life** and others to **eternal damnation**, grounding this distinction solely in God’s will and not in any foreseen merit. Calvin’s articulation of **predestination** became a hallmark of Reformed theology, shaping subsequent debates on the nature of **grace**, **free will**, and **God’s justice**.

- "By predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 3.21.5)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (Book 3, Chapters 21–24)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on Romans (especially Romans 8–9)
- Sermons on Ephesians (notably Ephesians 1)
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)
- The Bondage and Liberation of the Will

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unconditional Election**
    - God’s choice of the elect is not based on foreseen faith or merit.
    - Election is rooted solely in God’s sovereign good pleasure.
    - The number of the elect is fixed and known only to God.
    - Election results in the infallible salvation of those chosen.
    - "God adopts those whom he pleases, and rejects the rest." (Institutes, 3.21.7)

2. **Double Predestination**
    - God decrees both election to life and reprobation to death.
    - Reprobation is not a mere passive foreknowledge but an active decree.
    - Both aspects serve to display God’s justice and mercy.
    - The decree is mysterious but not unjust, as all deserve condemnation.
    - "He has chosen some for life, and others for eternal damnation." (Institutes, 3.21.5)

3. **Sovereignty of God’s Will**
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all things, including salvation and damnation.
    - Human decisions are secondary causes, subordinate to God’s decree.
    - God’s will is not arbitrary but always wise and just.
    - The decrees are immutable and cannot be thwarted.
    - "Nothing happens but what is knowingly and willingly decreed by Him." (Institutes, 1.16.3)

4. **Purpose of Election: Glory of God**
    - The primary end of election and reprobation is the manifestation of God’s glory.
    - Election displays God’s mercy; reprobation displays His justice.
    - God’s glory is magnified in both the salvation of the elect and the judgment of the reprobate.
    - The decrees are ultimately for God’s praise, not human speculation.
    - "The Lord has created those whom he unquestionably foreknew would go to destruction... to glorify his name in their perdition." (Institutes, 3.23.6)

5. **Assurance and Humility for the Elect**
    - The doctrine of election is meant to comfort and assure believers.
    - True assurance is grounded in Christ and the promises of the gospel.
    - The teaching should lead to humility, not pride or presumption.
    - The elect are called to holiness as evidence of their calling.
    - "The certainty of election soothes and quiets the minds of the godly." (Institutes, 3.21.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust doctrine of **predestination** became a defining feature of Reformed orthodoxy, influencing confessions such as the **Canons of Dort** and shaping debates within Protestantism. His careful distinction between **election** and **reprobation** set the terms for later theological reflection and controversy, especially in contrast to Arminian and Roman Catholic positions. Calvin’s emphasis on God’s sovereignty and the ultimate purpose of God’s glory continues to inform contemporary discussions on **divine providence** and the nature of salvation.
