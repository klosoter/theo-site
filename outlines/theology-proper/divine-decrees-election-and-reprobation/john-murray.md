# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robustly **Reformed doctrine of the divine decrees**, emphasizing the unconditional nature of **election** and the just, sovereign character of **reprobation**. He insisted that God's decrees are eternal, efficacious, and rooted in His immutable will, with **predestination** encompassing both the salvation of the elect and the passing over of the non-elect, all to the glory of God.

- "Election is not conditioned upon faith or good works foreseen, but has its ground solely in the sovereign will and good pleasure of God." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (Commentary, 1959–1965)
- "Calvin on the Sovereignty of God and Reprobation" (in Collected Writings)
- "The Reformed Faith and Modern Substitutes" (article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unconditional Election**
    - Election is grounded solely in God's sovereign will, not in any foreseen merit or action.
    - The decree of election is eternal and unchangeable.
    - Election is particular, not general or universal.
    - The elect are chosen in Christ, emphasizing union with Him as central.
    - "The reason for election resides wholly in God and not at all in man." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

2. **Reprobation as Divine Passing Over**
    - Reprobation is the counterpart to election, involving God's decision to pass over some.
    - It is not symmetrical with election; God does not actively predestine to sin.
    - Reprobation demonstrates God's justice and sovereignty.
    - The decree of reprobation is inscrutable but not arbitrary.
    - "Reprobation is not the same as predestination to sin; it is God’s passing by, not his causing of evil." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Efficacy and Certainty of the Decrees**
    - God's decrees infallibly secure their intended outcomes.
    - There is no possibility of the elect failing to be saved.
    - The decrees are comprehensive, covering all that comes to pass.
    - Human responsibility is upheld within the outworking of the decrees.
    - "The decrees of God are not suspended upon the contingencies of human decision." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

4. **Christocentric Predestination**
    - Election is always in Christ, never apart from Him.
    - Christ is both the foundation and executor of the decree.
    - The union of the elect with Christ is established in the eternal counsel.
    - Redemption is applied only to those chosen in Christ.
    - "All the saving blessings of the covenant are secured in Christ and for those who are in him." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

5. **Pastoral Implications of Election and Reprobation**
    - The doctrine of election is intended to foster assurance and humility in believers.
    - Preaching should call all to faith, trusting God to gather His elect.
    - The reality of reprobation should evoke reverence and sober self-examination.
    - The decrees do not nullify the free offer of the gospel.
    - "The doctrine of election is not a hindrance to evangelism but its guarantee." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of **unconditional election** and his nuanced treatment of **reprobation** have shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in the English-speaking world. His insistence on the Christ-centeredness of predestination and the pastoral value of these doctrines has influenced generations of pastors and theologians. Murray’s writings continue to serve as a standard exposition of the classic Reformed understanding of the divine decrees, balancing doctrinal precision with spiritual application.
