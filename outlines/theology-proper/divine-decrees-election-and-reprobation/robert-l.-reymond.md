# Robert L. Reymond (1932–2013)

Robert L. Reymond was a staunch defender of **Reformed orthodoxy** regarding the **divine decrees**, particularly the doctrines of **unconditional election** and **reprobation**. He emphasized the absolute sovereignty of God in predestination, maintaining that God's eternal purpose encompasses both the salvation of the elect and the just passing over of the reprobate, all to the glory of His justice and mercy.

- "God’s decree of election is not based upon foreseen faith or good works, but solely upon His sovereign good pleasure." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unconditional Election**
    - Election is grounded solely in God's sovereign will, not in any foreseen merit or action in the creature.
    - The decree of election is eternal, immutable, and particular to individuals.
    - Election is an act of pure grace, demonstrating God's mercy and love toward the undeserving.
    - The elect are chosen in Christ, and their salvation is secured by His mediatorial work.
    - "God’s election is not conditioned upon anything in man, but is an act of sovereign grace." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

2. **Reprobation as a Distinct Decree**
    - Reprobation is the counterpart to election, involving God’s just passing over and ordaining some to dishonor and wrath.
    - It is not symmetrical with election; God’s action in reprobation is permissive, not causative of sin.
    - Reprobation demonstrates the justice and holiness of God in contrast to His mercy in election.
    - The decree of reprobation is equally eternal and sovereign, yet always just.
    - "God’s decree of reprobation is not the cause of sin, but it does ordain to pass by some and leave them in their sin." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

3. **Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**
    - God’s decrees do not violate human responsibility; both are upheld in Scripture.
    - Human choices are real and significant, yet always within the scope of God’s sovereign plan.
    - The mystery of compatibilism is affirmed, refusing to subordinate divine sovereignty to human autonomy.
    - The biblical narrative consistently presents both divine initiative and human response.
    - "The Bible never presents God’s sovereignty and man’s responsibility as contradictory, but as complementary truths." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

4. **Christocentric Election**
    - Election is always in union with Christ, who is the foundation and mediator of the elect’s salvation.
    - Christ’s atonement is particular and effectual, securing the redemption of those chosen by the Father.
    - The work of the Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the elect alone.
    - The covenant of redemption undergirds the unity of the divine decrees in Christ.
    - "All whom the Father has given to the Son will come to Him, and none will be lost." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

5. **Pastoral Implications of Election and Reprobation**
    - The doctrine of election is intended to humble believers and foster assurance, not speculation or pride.
    - Preaching should offer the gospel freely, trusting God to call His elect through means.
    - The reality of reprobation calls for earnest evangelism and prayer, not fatalism.
    - The decrees of God provide comfort in God’s unchanging purpose and faithfulness.
    - "The doctrine of election, rightly understood, leads to praise, humility, and evangelistic zeal." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Reymond’s robust articulation of **predestination** and the divine decrees has reinforced classical Reformed theology in contemporary evangelical circles. His systematic clarity and biblical rigor have made his works standard references for students and pastors seeking to understand election and reprobation. Reymond’s influence persists in the ongoing defense of God’s sovereign grace and the pastoral application of these doctrines within the church.
