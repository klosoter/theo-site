# Jerome Zanchi (1516–1590)

Jerome Zanchi was a leading Reformed scholastic who articulated a robust doctrine of the **divine decrees**, emphasizing the absolute sovereignty of God in **election** and **reprobation**. He maintained that God's eternal will is the ultimate ground for the distinction between the elect and the reprobate, and he defended **unconditional election** and **double predestination** in continuity with the Augustinian tradition.

- "God, by his eternal and immutable counsel, has determined to choose some to eternal life and to leave others in their own corruption." (De Natura Dei)

## Key Works

- De Natura Dei (1577)
- De Praedestinatione Dei (1582)
- Confession of Christian Religion (Confessio Christianae Fidei, 1562)
- Commentary on Ephesians
- Peter Martyr Vermigli and the Italian Reformation (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Decrees are Eternal and Immutable**
    - God’s decrees concerning **election** and **reprobation** are established from eternity.
    - These decrees are not contingent upon human actions or foreseen faith.
    - The decrees are a single, unified act of the divine will.
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all that comes to pass.
    - "The decrees of God are not made in time, but from eternity, and are unchangeable." (De Natura Dei)

2. **Unconditional Election**
    - Election is grounded solely in God’s sovereign good pleasure.
    - No foreseen merit, faith, or works in the elect are the basis for their election.
    - Election is particular, not universal.
    - The elect are chosen in Christ as the mediator and head.
    - "God chose us not because he foresaw that we would believe, but that we might believe." (De Praedestinatione Dei)

3. **Double Predestination**
    - God decrees both the salvation of the elect and the just condemnation of the reprobate.
    - Reprobation is not a positive act of creating evil, but a passing over and just punishment for sin.
    - Both election and reprobation serve the manifestation of God’s justice and mercy.
    - The decree of reprobation is as sovereign and eternal as that of election.
    - "As God elects some to life, so he passes by others, ordaining them to just condemnation." (Confessio Christianae Fidei)

4. **Christ as the Foundation of Election**
    - Election is always in Christ, the mediator appointed by God.
    - The elect are united to Christ and receive all spiritual blessings in him.
    - Christ’s work is the means by which the decree of election is accomplished.
    - The decree does not bypass Christ, but is realized through his person and work.
    - "No one is elected except in Christ, and for his sake." (Commentary on Ephesians)

5. **Human Responsibility and Means**
    - The decree does not negate the genuine responsibility of human beings.
    - The preaching of the gospel and faith are the ordained means for gathering the elect.
    - The reprobate are left in their sin by their own willful rejection of God.
    - Assurance of election is found in faith and the fruits of the Spirit.
    - "God’s decree does not destroy the liberty of the will, nor the use of means." (De Praedestinatione Dei)

## Legacy and Impact

Zanchi’s rigorous articulation of **double predestination** and the eternal nature of the divine decrees influenced later Reformed scholasticism and helped shape the confessional standards of the Reformed tradition. His work provided a bridge between the early Reformers and later systematic theologians, especially in the development of the doctrine of **unconditional election**. Zanchi’s careful distinctions and Christocentric focus on election remain significant in discussions of predestination within Reformed theology.
