# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner rejected **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge**, emphasizing instead the primacy of **divine sovereignty** and the existential encounter between God and humanity. He critiqued speculative attempts to reconcile **divine foreknowledge** with **human freedom** apart from the biblical revelation, insisting that such constructs undermine the personal and relational character of God’s will.

- "God’s knowledge is not a neutral foreseeing, but a creative knowing which is identical with His willing." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter
- Revelation and Reason
- Man in Revolt

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation over Speculation**
   - Brunner prioritized **revelation** as the only reliable source for understanding God’s knowledge.
   - He critiqued philosophical systems, like **Molinism**, for projecting human logic onto divine mysteries.
   - Middle knowledge was seen as an unnecessary abstraction not grounded in biblical witness.
   - The personal God is encountered, not deduced through speculative categories.
   - "The God of the Bible is not the God of the philosophers." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Divine Sovereignty and Freedom**
   - God’s will is not conditioned by hypothetical human choices.
   - Brunner emphasized the **sovereignty of God** in both knowledge and action.
   - He rejected any view that would subordinate God’s freedom to a logical system.
   - Divine knowledge is inseparable from divine willing.
   - "God’s knowing is a creative act, not a passive observation." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

3. **Critique of Middle Knowledge**
   - Brunner argued that **middle knowledge** (scientia media) is speculative and unbiblical.
   - He saw it as an attempt to rationalize the mystery of **divine providence** and **human responsibility**.
   - Such constructs, he believed, diminish the existential reality of God’s relationship with humanity.
   - Middle knowledge was viewed as a product of scholastic rationalism, not biblical faith.
   - "The so-called ‘middle knowledge’ is a product of the theological imagination, not of revelation." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

4. **Human Freedom as Encounter**
   - Brunner affirmed **human freedom** but within the context of encounter with God.
   - He denied that freedom requires a realm of hypothetical possibilities foreknown by God.
   - True freedom is realized in response to God’s call, not in abstract autonomy.
   - The existential relationship with God defines the limits and reality of human freedom.
   - "Freedom is not the ability to choose otherwise, but the capacity to respond to God’s address." (Truth as Encounter)

5. **Christocentric Epistemology**
   - Knowledge of God, including His foreknowledge, is centered in the revelation of Christ.
   - Brunner rejected any doctrine of God’s knowledge that bypasses the **Christ event**.
   - The meaning of divine omniscience is disclosed in the personal self-giving of God in Christ.
   - All theological constructs must be tested by their fidelity to the revelation in Jesus.
   - "All knowledge of God is determined by the revelation in Jesus Christ." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s rejection of **middle knowledge** and Molinism shaped 20th-century Protestant theology by re-centering the discussion on **revelation** and the existential encounter with God. His critique of speculative theology influenced later neo-orthodox thinkers and contributed to ongoing debates about **divine sovereignty** and **human freedom**. While his stance limited engagement with scholastic categories, it reinforced the primacy of biblical revelation in systematic theology. Brunner’s work remains a significant counterpoint to both classical Molinism and rationalist approaches to the doctrine of God.
