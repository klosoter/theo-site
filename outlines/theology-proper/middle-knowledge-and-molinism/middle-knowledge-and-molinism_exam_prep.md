### ESSAY
Middle knowledge names a proposed mode of divine cognition positioned between God’s **natural knowledge** of all possibilities and his **free knowledge** of the actual world. Its heart is the claim that there exist true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom known by God logically prior to his decree, such that by consulting these truths God can select a feasible world that instantiates his purposes through libertarianly free creaturely choices. Molinism is the systematic deployment of this notion to reconcile robust providence with libertarian freedom and to route predestination through prevolitional conditionals rather than through a unilateral decree. The conceptual center is thus the relation of divine knowledge to divine causality: does God know because he causes, or cause because he knows? The answer determines not only the shape of providence and predestination but the integrity of **divine aseity**, **divine simplicity**, and the coherence of **primary and secondary causality**.

Thomas Aquinas sets the classical background against which the Jesuit–Dominican controversy unfolds. For Thomas, God’s knowledge is identical to his essence. God knows all things by knowing himself as their first cause. He distinguishes **natural knowledge** of possibles and **free knowledge** of actuals, and he insists that the divine will is the cause of being and of the determinate order of providence. He affirms infallible foreknowledge of contingent effects precisely because God is the universal cause whose causality extends to the very act of the will without violence. On this view, the order is priority of causality, not dependence of God on truths external to himself. Aquinas does not articulate scientia media. In his framework, counterfactual truths are entailed by the range of divine power and the determinate decree, not by independent creaturely acts foreknown in abstraction from divine causality. This classical framework emphasizes **divine simplicity** and the doctrine that the intellection by which God knows creatures is identical to the volition by which he ordains their being and operations. It also underwrites **concursus** in which secondary causes act truly under the sustaining and premotive influence of the first cause.

Luis de Molina enters this landscape amid late sixteenth-century debates over grace, freedom, and predestination. In the Concordia of 1588, he argues that to avoid making God the author of sin and to preserve libertarian freedom, one must posit a third logical moment of knowledge, **scientia media**, by which God knows prevolitionally what any possible creature would freely do in any possible circumstance. Middle knowledge is neither necessary like **natural knowledge**, nor consequent on the decree like **free knowledge**. By consulting this body of conditional truths, God chooses a world that will achieve his ends without causally determining creaturely choices. He thus secures detailed providence while honoring a freedom defined by the power of contrary choice, not merely sourcehood under determined motives. In his method he imports the machinery of contemporary logic and a finely grained analysis of circumstances and creaturely essences into the doctrine of God. The theological payoffs he seeks are considerable. First, prophecy and providence become compatible with libertarian choice because God ensures outcomes by arranging circumstances in light of known counterfactuals. Second, predestination can be maintained without antecedent reprobation by allowing God to elect those whom he knew would freely cooperate with grace under certain circumstances. Third, the problem of divine permission of sin becomes tractable because God need not determine evil, only permit it in light of counterfactuals that he does not control.

Molina’s opponents saw in this proposal a deep metaphysical shift. Domingo Báñez, the leading Dominican Thomist, contended that Molina’s view inverts the causal relation between God and creatures. For Báñez, God’s will and knowledge are the cause of all being and act. To secure infallibility without overthrowing contingency, he elaborated the doctrine of physical premotion and efficacious grace. God premoves the secondary cause to act in such a way that the act is infallibly produced but retains its created mode and contingency. Contingency means dependence on a proximate cause whose nature is to act contingently, not indeterminacy with respect to the first cause. Báñez rejects a prevolitional body of counterfactual truths independent of God’s decree as an assault on **aseity**. For him, counterfactuals of free acts are either grounded in the decree by which God premoves causes, or they are not true. In Thomist idiom, God knows creaturely acts by knowing himself as their first cause. If God’s selection of a world is constrained by a set of independent creature-anchored truths, his sovereignty is reduced to browsing a menu whose contents he did not determine. Tactically, Báñez’s critics accused him of making God the author of sin. He replied with the traditional twofold causality distinction: God is the first cause of the act as act, which is good inasmuch as it is an existent, while the defect in the act which is sin arises from the deficiency of the finite will as a secondary cause. On this classical picture, **primary and secondary causality** coinhere without competition, since God’s causality is transcendent and nonunivocal.

Francisco Suárez, a Jesuit near-contemporary of Molina, attempted to mediate by refining the relation of grace to free choice. His congruism holds that God gives grace congruent to the circumstances in which he knows by **scientia media** the will would freely consent. He defends the existence of counterfactual truths of freedom and aims to reconcile their prevolitional status with divine sovereignty by emphasizing God’s comprehensive control over circumstances. Suárez’s account shows that the decisive fault line is not simply Jesuit versus Dominican, but the status of counterfactuals vis-a-vis the decree. If their truth is prior to decree, God’s providential plan is conditioned by something not himself. If their truth is posterior, the Molinist project collapses into either Thomism or Reformed decree.

Reformed scholastics received this controversy with sympathy for the Thomist insistence on divine priority and with heightened concern for the unconditioned decree. Francis Turretin is decisive here. In his Institutes of Elenctic Theology, he rejects **scientia media** as incompatible with **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and the gratuitousness of predestination. He argues that conditional future contingents are known to God, but their truth depends either on God’s power considered absolutely, which yields possibility, or on God’s decree, which yields certainty. There is no third kind of truth independent of God that binds his will. Turretin affirms that God knows what free agents would do under any circumstance, but he grounds such knowledge in either the decree that ordains those circumstances and concurses with the secondary cause, or in the complete comprehension of creaturely natures as possible effects of his power. He denies libertarian freedom as metaphysically incoherent under **providence**, adopting a rigorous **compatibilist freedom** in which human responsibility is secured by the rational will acting according to its motives and character, themselves within the scope of the decree and **concursus**. On this account biblical counterfactuals such as David’s inquiry at Keilah or Christ’s lament over Chorazin are fully explained: God reveals what would happen under specified conditions because he knows the disposition of agents and the ordained order of causes. The Reformed insistence is that the truth value of such conditionals is not independent of divine ordination. Turretin presses the fundamental concern that Molinism subjects God’s decree to a feasibility filter he did not determine. That violates **aseity** because it makes God’s will really conditioned by contingent realities not caused by him, and it fractures **simplicity** by making divine knowledge of some contingent truths not identical to divine willing.

In contemporary analytic philosophy of religion, William Lane Craig has become the leading public defender of Molinism. He argues that middle knowledge underwrites a unified theistic explanation of prophecy, petitionary prayer, evangelistic effectiveness, divine guidance, and a robust theodicy. He combines Molinism with Plantinga’s notion of transworld depravity to argue that God may not have feasible worlds in which free creatures never sin, which softens the problem of evil while preserving libertarian freedom. On the grounding problem, Craig has proposed that counterfactuals of creaturely freedom need no truthmakers beyond the creatures’ essences as grasped by God’s perfect cognitive powers, or that truthmaker maximalism is a misguided metaphysical principle. He also insists that the logical moments in God are not temporal nor real distinctions in God, but conceptual orderings of God’s simple knowledge from the standpoint of reason. He thus claims fidelity to **divine simplicity** while resisting the charge of dependence. Craig’s constructive program keeps Molinism in the center of contemporary debate by showing its alleged explanatory reach and by engaging the metaphysical underpinnings in modal semantics and truthmaker theory.

The internal debates within Molinism revolve around three pressure points. First, the grounding of counterfactuals of freedom. If they are genuinely contingent and not determined by God’s decree, in virtue of what are they true? Appeals to creaturely essences threaten to smuggle in foreordination via essentialist constraints or to leave truths hanging free of any truthmaker. Appeals to God’s cognitive perfection risk collapsing into voluntarism or Bañezianism, since God would know them by being their cause. Second, the congruist question of how to secure not merely foreknowledge but infallible providence. If God only arranges circumstances congruent with human consent, why is consent certain rather than lucky? Third, the feasibility set. If the set of worlds accessible to God is limited by independent counterfactual truths, God’s freedom is bounded by something he did not will. Molinists reply that logical possibility already bounds God’s freedom and that feasible-world constraints are no different. Yet the Reformed and Thomist rejoinder is immediate: modal constraints derive from God’s nature, whereas contingent counterfactuals about creatures are contingent and thus cannot serve as constraints sourced in divine necessity. This goes to the heart of **aseity**.

The external debates are threefold. Against Bañezian Thomism, Molinists object that physical premotion collapses freedom into extrinsic specification by God and threatens to make God the author of sin. Thomists counter that premotion does not coerce but perfects agency, that contingency remains in the mode of the secondary cause, and that divine causality is not univocal with created causes. Against Reformed compatibilism, Molinists press that if God’s decree determines motives infallibly, libertarian freedom is denied and responsibility imperiled. Reformed scholastics answer with the distinction between necessity of the consequent and necessity of the consequence. Given God’s decree and the actual motives, the act is certain, but the act is performed voluntarily by the agent, who could have done otherwise if his will had been otherwise. Moral responsibility tracks the will’s ownership of the act, not indeterministic powers. Against simple foreknowledge and open theism, Molinists argue that only middle knowledge provides purposeful providence. Simple foreknowledge gives God useless knowledge that cannot guide a decree, while open theism loses omniscience. Classical theists agree that open theism must be rejected. They resist the Molinist claim about uselessness by noting that on a classical view God’s decree is logically prior to knowledge of futuribles, so the complaint presupposes the Molinist ordering.

Contemporary debates add new tools but the same fault lines. Counterfactual semantics in the Stalnaker–Lewis tradition distinguishes between would and might counterfactuals and locates truth in similarity orderings over possible worlds. On Molinism, the relevant counterfactuals are would-counterfactuals whose truth is sensitive to detailed circumstantial specification. The Reformed and Thomist critique imports truthmaker theory. If would-counterfactuals about libertarian choices are true before decree, they have no grounding beyond abstract essences or brute facts. Bruteness at this point is unacceptable for classical theism. Problem of evil discussions employ transworld depravity to argue that God may lack control over the feasibility set. Classical theists argue that this either makes God contingently unlucky, thereby imperiling **immutability** of the divine purpose, or else reintroduces decree under another name since the feasibility set begins to function like a hidden decree to which God submits. Biblical counterfactuals are often cited for Molinism. Two texts exemplify the debate. In 1 Samuel 23, God reveals that the men of Keilah would surrender David were he to remain. On a classical view, God knows this through his comprehensive grasp of human dispositions and of the causal nexus he ordains, not through libertarian counterfactuals that float free of decree. In Matthew 11, Jesus declares that Tyre and Sidon would have repented had they seen the miracles done in Chorazin and Bethsaida. Molinists claim this requires middle knowledge. A Reformed account observes that God reveals what would be true under a contrary condition, which he did not decree to obtain. The truth of the conditional depends on the relation between the ordained natures and the specified means, which God comprehends absolutely, so no scientia media is required.

The position to defend is that Molinism fails the classical theist tests of **aseity** and **divine simplicity**, and that a Reformed compatibilist account secures the goods Molinism seeks without its liabilities. First, aseity. If there are contingent, determinate truths about what Peter would freely do were he placed in C, and if these truths are prior to and independent of God’s decree, then there are contingent realities not caused by God which nonetheless condition his will. This introduces a dependence of God’s decision on something outside himself, contradicting aseity. The Molinist reply that logical moments are only conceptual does not help if the objects of knowledge are extrinsic to God and not grounded in him. Classical theism maintains that God knows all things by knowing himself as the first cause. Middle knowledge says there are some contingent truths that God does not cause. Second, simplicity. On the classical account, God’s knowledge and will are identical, so that God knows what he wills and wills what he knows in one simple act. To locate a set of contingent truths not consequent on the decree is to posit a real distinction between the content of knowing and willing. Molinists call the distinction merely logical, but the content of the knowledge remains extrinsic, and the role it plays in constraining the decree makes the conceptual distinction function as a real ordering. Third, providence. The feasibility set constrains God in a way akin to luck. If there is no feasible world in which certain goods are obtained without certain evils, God is unlucky rather than sovereign. The Molinist response appeals to divine wisdom in selecting the best among feasible worlds. The classical rejoinder is that God’s wisdom is legislative, not reactive. He ordains the order of causes. To treat his decree as bound by precarious creaturely truths is to mislocate sovereignty.

A likely objection presses that denying middle knowledge collapses contingency into fatalism and makes God the author of sin. The classical reply is twofold. First, contingency is preserved at the level of secondary causes. God’s decree ordains not only outcomes but also the mode of their production. Acts of will are voluntary, issuing from reasons and character, and God’s **concursus** does not coerce but actuates nature according to kind. Second, moral authorship is not equivalent to universal causality. The defect of sin is a privation in a finite agent. The first cause causes the entity of the act, which as being is good, while the moral evil arises from the creaturely deficiency. Scripture itself insists on both sides: Herod and Pontius Pilate did what God’s hand predestined to occur, yet they are culpable. A second objection claims that the Reformed account cannot explain biblical counterfactuals. But God’s counterfactual judgments can be understood as knowledge of the order of causes as he has freely ordained it in his comprehensive decree, including what would be the case under specified antecedents he did not in fact ordain. There is no need to posit counterfactuals of libertarian freedom that are true independently of God. A third objection says that without middle knowledge petitionary prayer and guidance collapse into theater, since God has already decreed all things. The answer is that God ordains not only ends but also means, including prayers, as real secondary causes. He decrees that certain goods obtain through prayer, so prayer is instrumentally necessary. This preserves the difference between fatalism and decree. A fourth objection insists that Molinism uniquely preserves divine goodness by separating God from determination of sin. Classical theism responds that separating God from causality of evil by evacuating his causality from free choices is not necessary. The tradition has long denied that God causes the defect while asserting he ordains the good of the order that includes permitted defects. The greater-good structures of providence are secured by decree more strongly than by a feasibility set God did not choose.

At this point it is important to integrate adjacent loci. In Christology, the will of Christ according to the human nature is not libertarian but impeccable and impeccable precisely by union with the divine person. In soteriology, regeneration changes the heart such that the will freely chooses Christ infallibly. If libertarian freedom were required for moral responsibility, the doctrine of effectual calling would be impossible. In theology proper, **impassibility** and **immutability** anchor the claim that God’s decree is unconditioned; his will is not passively receptive to external conditions. In hermeneutics and **analogical knowledge**, we must not turn the logical moments of divine knowledge into temporal or real composites in God. The Reformed account is careful here: speaking of moments is a human ordering of God’s simple act, not ontological layering inside God. Molinism itself invokes that same caveat, but then gives these moments distinct objects with distinct dependencies. This is the pressure point where analogy is stretched thin.

The constructive alternative directs us back to Aquinas and Turretin. God’s knowledge ranges over possibles by **natural knowledge** as he knows his power and the ways it could be imitated in creatures. God’s knowledge of actuals, including future contingents and conditionals about them, is by **free knowledge** as he knows his decree and the order of causes he has willed to actualize. On this account there are true counterfactuals of creaturely action, but their truth is either possible in light of God’s power or actual in light of his will; there is no autonomous tier mediating between God and creatures. Practical payoffs equal or exceed those promised by Molinism. Prophecy and providence are purposive because God ordains the ends and the means. Prayer is effectual because God decrees to accomplish goods through it. Evangelism is serious because God ordains the salvation of the elect through the preaching of the gospel. Theodicy is sober because God ordains to permit evil for greater goods that he alone can secure. And biblical counterfactuals can be read as revelations of what would obtain under different antecedents as analyzed within the divinely ordained order of causes.

One final examiner-style challenge concerns the modal structure. If all counterfactuals about libertarian choices are rejected, does God’s omniscience shrink? The answer is that God knows all truths. There are no truths of counterfactuals of libertarian freedom independent of the decree. What God knows instead are all possible natures and circumstances and what would result under any decree he might will. The would-claims that matter are grounded in his chosen order and are known by him by knowing himself as first cause. Another challenge asks whether this makes the decree arbitrary. The answer is no. The decree is wise and good because it expresses the simple divine perfection. It does not select among independent creaturely truths; it determines the order according to God’s perfect ends. A further challenge asks whether this erases the meaningfulness of contrary-to-fact claims in Scripture. The classical view affirms their truth as judgments about what would follow from specified antecedents within the structure of causes as willed by God, regardless of whether those antecedents are actualized.

The comparative verdict is therefore clear. Molina’s scientia media was a brilliant and historically fecund attempt to reconcile libertarian freedom with detailed providence. It reframed debates on grace and predestination and has inspired contemporary analytic developments. Yet it achieves its reconciling aim by relocating the ground of providence from God’s decree to a prevolitional corpus of counterfactuals that are neither necessary nor decreed. That move collides with **divine aseity** and **divine simplicity** as those are articulated in classical theism and confessed in Reformed orthodoxy. Báñez saw the metaphysical cost and refused it. Suárez tried to soften it without resolving the dependence problem. Craig has made its explanatory reach vivid, but only by absorbing metaphysical costs classical theism cannot accept. Turretin’s refusal to cede ground at the level of God’s mode of knowing is a more promising path. He retains knowledge of counterfactuals, but he locates their truth either in the omnipotent range of divine power or in the decree that alone confers actuality on contingent truths. In that way he secures meticulous providence, genuine responsibility under **compatibilist freedom**, the meaningfulness of prayer and proclamation, and the exegesis of biblical counterfactuals, while preserving the bedrock commitments of **primary and secondary causality**, **concursus**, **divine simplicity**, and **aseity**. For Westminster examiners the key is to show that the economies of salvation and providence do not require middle knowledge, and that Molinism’s middle incurs theological debts that classical theism cannot pay.

- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does denying middle knowledge make God author of sin? No; distinguish act as act from defect, and uphold noncompetitive causality.
  - How do you explain biblical counterfactuals? As judgments about ordained orders of causes under specified antecedents, not libertarian conditionals independent of decree.
  - What grounds counterfactual truths on your view? God’s power for possibilities and God’s decree for actual conditionals; no autonomous tier.
  - Does compatibilism preserve responsibility? Yes; responsibility tracks ownership and guidance control, not indeterminism.
  - Does the feasibility set objection misfire because logic also constrains God? Modal necessities flow from God’s nature; contingent counterfactuals cannot bound an unconditioned will without violating **aseity**.
