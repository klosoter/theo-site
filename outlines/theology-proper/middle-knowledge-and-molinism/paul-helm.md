# Paul Helm (1940–)

Paul Helm is a leading Reformed philosopher and theologian who critically engages with **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge** from a distinctly **Augustinian-Calvinist** perspective. Helm rejects the coherence of middle knowledge, arguing that it undermines **divine sovereignty** and the classical doctrine of **God’s omniscience**, instead affirming a robust view of **divine providence** and **meticulous sovereignty**.

- "Molinism, with its doctrine of middle knowledge, is not a viable way of reconciling divine sovereignty and human freedom." ("The Providence of God")

## Key Works

- The Providence of God (Contours of Christian Theology)
- Eternal God: A Study of God without Time
- "Molinism and Providence" (in Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views)
- "Calvin and the Calvinists" (essay)
- "Paul Helm on Molinism" (various journal articles and blog posts)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge**
    - Asserts that **middle knowledge** is philosophically and biblically unsound.
    - Argues it introduces a realm of truth independent of God's will.
    - Claims it compromises the **aseity** and **sovereignty** of God.
    - Maintains that God’s knowledge is not contingent on creaturely freedom.
    - "Middle knowledge is an unnecessary and problematic addition to the doctrine of divine omniscience." (The Providence of God)

2. **Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty**
    - Upholds that God ordains all that comes to pass, including human choices.
    - Sees no tension between **divine sovereignty** and genuine human responsibility.
    - Critiques Molinism for subordinating God’s will to hypothetical creaturely acts.
    - Emphasizes that God’s decree is comprehensive and all-encompassing.
    - "God’s sovereignty is not limited by the supposed autonomy of human agents." (The Providence of God)

3. **Compatibilist Freedom**
    - Advocates for **compatibilism**: human freedom is compatible with divine determinism.
    - Rejects the libertarian freedom presupposed by Molinism.
    - Argues that moral responsibility does not require the power of contrary choice.
    - Sees compatibilism as more consistent with Scripture and Reformed tradition.
    - "The freedom required for moral responsibility is not libertarian but compatibilist." (Eternal God)

4. **Classical Doctrine of Divine Omniscience**
    - Holds that God’s knowledge is exhaustive, eternal, and grounded in his decree.
    - Denies that God learns or reacts to creaturely decisions.
    - Critiques the Molinist distinction between natural, middle, and free knowledge.
    - Affirms that God’s knowledge is simple and not divided into temporal stages.
    - "God knows all things because he ordains all things." (The Providence of God)

5. **Augustinian-Calvinist Tradition**
    - Stands within the **Augustinian** and **Reformed** theological heritage.
    - Draws on Calvin, Edwards, and other Reformed thinkers in critiquing Molinism.
    - Emphasizes the priority of God’s will over all created reality.
    - Sees Molinism as a departure from historic Reformed orthodoxy.
    - "The Reformed tradition has no need of middle knowledge to safeguard either God’s sovereignty or human responsibility." (The Providence of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Paul Helm’s rigorous critique of **Molinism** has shaped contemporary Reformed responses to the doctrine of **middle knowledge**. His defense of **divine sovereignty** and compatibilist freedom has reinforced classical Reformed commitments in the face of philosophical challenges. Helm’s work continues to serve as a key resource for those seeking to articulate a robustly Augustinian understanding of providence and omniscience in dialogue with modern philosophical theology.
