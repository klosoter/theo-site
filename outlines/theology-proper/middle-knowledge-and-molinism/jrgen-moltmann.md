# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann does not directly engage with **middle knowledge** or **Molinism** in the technical sense, but his theology of **divine knowledge**, **freedom**, and **eschatology** offers a critical alternative to such frameworks. Moltmann emphasizes a **dynamic relationship** between God and creation, rejecting deterministic models of divine foreknowledge in favor of a **relational and open future** grounded in the **Trinitarian God**.

- "God does not foresee everything in advance, but waits and hopes for the response of his creation." (The Coming of God)

## Key Works

- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology
- The Crucified God
- God in Creation: A New Theology of Creation and the Spirit of God
- The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God
- Experiences in Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Relational Divine Knowledge**
   - God’s knowledge is shaped by genuine relationship with creation.
   - Rejects a static, exhaustive foreknowledge that would render history predetermined.
   - Emphasizes the openness of the future in God’s engagement with the world.
   - Divine knowledge is participatory, not merely observational.
   - "God’s knowledge is not the knowledge of a spectator, but of a participant." (God in Creation)

2. **Critique of Classical Omniscience**
   - Challenges the notion that God’s omniscience requires exhaustive knowledge of all future contingents.
   - Argues that classical views undermine creaturely freedom and authentic history.
   - Suggests that God’s omniscience is best understood in the context of love and hope.
   - Sees divine knowledge as oriented toward the eschatological fulfillment of creation.
   - "God’s omniscience is the knowledge of love, not of fate." (The Coming of God)

3. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge**
   - Does not affirm a “middle knowledge” as proposed by Molinism.
   - Views such frameworks as overly speculative and incompatible with biblical revelation.
   - Argues that God’s freedom and the world’s freedom are not in competition.
   - Prefers a model where God’s purposes unfold in genuine interaction with creation.
   - "God’s future is not a fixed script, but an open promise." (Experiences in Theology)

4. **Eschatological Openness**
   - The future is not exhaustively determined, but open to new possibilities.
   - God’s promises shape the future, but do not eliminate human response.
   - Eschatology is the horizon for understanding divine knowledge and action.
   - The openness of the future is essential for hope and participation.
   - "Hope opens up the future, and with it, the knowledge of God." (The Coming of God)

5. **Trinitarian Participation**
   - God’s knowledge and action are rooted in the dynamic life of the Trinity.
   - The Spirit’s presence in creation enables real freedom and novelty.
   - The cross reveals God’s willingness to suffer with and for creation.
   - Divine knowledge is inseparable from God’s loving involvement in history.
   - "The triune God is the God of open history, not closed destiny." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has significantly influenced contemporary discussions on **divine providence**, **freedom**, and the openness of the future. His rejection of deterministic models, including **middle knowledge** and Molinism, has encouraged theologians to explore more relational and participatory understandings of God’s knowledge. Moltmann’s emphasis on **eschatological hope** and the **Trinitarian** nature of God continues to shape debates on the compatibility of divine sovereignty and human freedom.
