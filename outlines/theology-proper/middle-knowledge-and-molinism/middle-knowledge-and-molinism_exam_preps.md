### TITLE
Reconciling Sovereignty and Freedom: A Reformed Critique and Qualified Use of Middle Knowledge

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: whether **middle knowledge** can coherently reconcile exhaustive divine foreknowledge, robust creaturely freedom, and meticulous providence without compromising **divine simplicity** and **aseity**.
- Decisive figures: Luis de Molina, Francisco Suárez, Domingo Báñez, Jacobus Arminius, William Lane Craig.
- Relevant traditions: early modern Roman Catholic scholasticism, Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed and Remonstrant theologies, contemporary analytic philosophy of religion.
- Debates:
  - Internal: varieties of Molinism and differing accounts of counterfactual truthmakers and freedom.
  - External: Thomist physical premotion and Augustinian–Reformed **compatibilism** versus Molinist **libertarian freedom**; open theism and simple-foreknowledge Arminianism as rival solutions.
  - Contemporary: grounding objection, Trinitarian and Christological implications, problem of evil and providence, and the use of Molinism in analytic apologetics.
- Position: I will defend that classical Molinism is incompatible with **classical theism** and Reformed **decree** and **providence**, but that certain logical tools forged in Molinist debates concerning counterfactuals and providence can be appropriated within a robustly Reformed, non-Molinist framework.

### ESSAY
Any oral defense of **middle knowledge** and Molinism must begin with the conceptual core. The Molinist claims that between God’s **natural knowledge** of all necessary truths and possibilities and his **free knowledge** of the actual world he decrees, there stands a logically middle moment in which God knows, prior to and independent of his decree, what any possible free creature would do in any possible set of circumstances. These are counterfactuals of creaturely freedom such as “If Peter were in circumstance C, he would freely deny Christ.” On that basis, God chooses which world to actualize, providentially ordering history by selecting the set of circumstances under which free creatures will do what he knows they would do. The aim is to reconcile exhaustive, meticulous providence with **libertarian freedom**, preserve a strong doctrine of **foreknowledge**, and offer powerful answers to the problem of evil and the distribution of salvation.

Two structural commitments are essential. First, the counterfactuals God knows at this middle logical moment are supposed to be contingent and yet not dependent on his will. If they depended on his will they would collapse back into free knowledge and no longer capture independent creaturely freedom. Second, creaturely acts in those counterfactuals are libertarianly free: given the same past and the same causal conditions, the agent could genuinely do otherwise. A Molinist will insist that God does not determine which counterfactuals are true, he simply knows them, but he does determine which of those counterfactuals become actual by choosing to instantiate particular circumstances. Thus providence is strongly intentional and yet, it is claimed, non-determining.

Historically, middle knowledge emerges in late sixteenth century Roman Catholic scholasticism, within an intra‑Catholic battle over grace and freedom. Luis de Molina (1535–1600), a Spanish Jesuit, is the architect whose name the system bears. His major work, the Concordia, aims precisely at a “concord” between the efficaciousness of grace and genuine free choice. Molina inherits from medieval scholasticism the distinction between natural and free knowledge, and the conviction that God is omniscient and simple. He also inherits the debates around **predestination**, **efficacious grace**, and human cooperation that were intensified by the rise of Protestantism and by internal Catholic Augustinian currents.

Molina’s method is sophisticated. He starts from an account of human freedom as **liberum arbitrium**, power for opposites, which must be preserved if moral responsibility and genuine merit are to stand. He rejects a Thomistic model of **physical premotion**, according to which God moves the secondary cause infallibly toward a particular act. In such a model, grace is intrinsically efficacious. Molina worries that this renders human choice necessitated by God’s premotion, even if not coerced. To avoid this he posits that God, prior to decreeing any world, knows a vast range of would‑counterfactuals concerning what any possible person would freely do in any circumstance. On this basis, God chooses a world in which his purposes are secured by the pattern of free acts that he foreknew via middle knowledge.

An examiner may object: does this not entail that something other than God determines what is true about creaturely counterfactuals, thereby compromising **divine aseity** and **simplicity**? Molina’s answer is subtle. He denies that these truths are brute and independent of God. They are grounded in the natures of creatures as understood in God’s perfect intuitive knowledge. God has a comprehensive, non-discursive understanding of all creaturely essences and all possible circumstances. From this perspective he sees, in a way not fully analogous to creaturely inference, what each would freely do. Yet Molina insists that God does not cause these counterfactual truths. They are not effects of the divine will but objects of the divine intellect. Thus, he claims, God remains the ontological source of all being, but the logical order within God’s knowledge allows for contingent truths not produced by his will.

This is precisely where Francisco Suárez (1548–1617) becomes decisive. Also a Jesuit and one of the last great scholastics, Suárez systematizes and defends middle knowledge, softening and clarifying Molina’s formulations. In his Disputationes Metaphysicae and theological works, Suárez develops a more refined doctrine of **divine concurrence**. He aims to secure two things: that God is the universal concurring cause of every act, and that finite agents retain formal freedom and contingency. Suárez rejects the Thomist idea that God’s premotion must be prior in the order of causality to the free act. Instead he posits a joint causality, where God concurs with the secondary cause in such a way that the mode of the effect, including its contingency, is from the creature, while the being of the act is from God.

Suárez’s influence is twofold. First, he stabilizes the Molinist paradigm as a legitimate Catholic option by giving it a more robust metaphysical backbone. Second, he anticipates later analytic concerns by treating counterfactuals and modal truths with real precision. Yet his proposal invites a sharp Thomist critique: if the mode of the act’s contingency is not from God, then there is an aspect of the act’s reality that escapes divine causality. The external Thomist objection is that such a move fractures **divine simplicity** and **providence**, carving out a domain within which God is no longer the total cause of being and mode.

Here Domingo Báñez (1528–1604), a Dominican and a rigorous Thomist, stands as Molina’s principal early opponent. Báñez defends classical Thomist **predetermination** and physical premotion. For him, a free act is not liberty of indifference but liberty of spontaneity: the act proceeds from the agent in accord with its nature without exterior coercion. God, through an infallible premotion, gives the will its act and its specification at the moment of choice. Contingency is preserved at the level of secondary causes relative to created conditions, but God’s decree is ultimate and fully determining. He rejects middle knowledge because it renders God dependent on independent creaturely determinations of counterfactual truth. For Báñez, any truth that is not caused by God is a denial of God as the first cause of all that is. Moreover, he argues that Molinist libertarianism undermines the certainty of providence: if counterfactuals are not determined by God, then their conjunction with an actual world could not be infallibly ordered without either collapsing into determinism or leaving gaps in providence.

This early Catholic debate shapes the entire field. On one side, Molinists like Molina and Suárez claim a reconciliation of freedom and providence by introducing **middle knowledge**. On the other, Thomists like Báñez insist that such reconciliation is illusory and metaphysically destructive. The controversy draws the papal Congregatio de Auxiliis, which eventually refuses to condemn either side, but, in effect, cements Molinism and Thomism as two rival Catholic frameworks for grace and freedom.

The Reformation and post-Reformation debates about **predestination**, **providence**, and **human freedom** intersect this discussion from a different angle. Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609), trained in Reformed circles yet moving in a Remonstrant direction, adopts an essentially Molinist model of foreknowledge to argue against unconditional election. Arminius affirms exhaustive divine foreknowledge but understands election as grounded in God’s middle knowledge of future libertarian choices. God knows, prior to decree, what each person would do under the sufficient grace he bestows, and he elects those whom he foresees will freely believe. While Arminius does not simply repeat Molina, he appropriates the fundamental structure of **middle knowledge** to undercut a Reformed, unconditional **decree**.

This creates a new external tension for Reformed theology. The Reformed scholastics, like Turretin, are aware of Molinism and reject it for reasons that echo Báñez, while also differing from Thomists in their own articulation of **compatibilism** and **concursus**. They insist on a single, eternal decree by which God foreordains whatsoever comes to pass, including free acts, in such a way that these acts are genuinely voluntary and morally accountable. For them, God’s knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom is not a logically middle, prevolitional moment. It is a subset of his **natural knowledge** of all possibilities as ordered by his power and wisdom or a function of his **free knowledge** of what he has decreed. Either way, God does not passively receive contingent truths prior to decree. He knows them either as possibilities within his own power or as certain because he has ordained them.

When the examiner presses, “Is there any room for a Reformed Molinism,” the answer must be carefully differentiated. If by Molinism one means simply that God knows counterfactuals and that he uses that knowledge in providential governance, then yes, the Reformed strongly affirm this. Scripture itself uses counterfactual conditionals, for instance David being told that Keilah would deliver him up if he stayed there, which he does not. The Reformed will speak of God’s knowledge of **conditional future contingents**. However, if by Molinism one means that these counterfactuals are contingent, not decreed by God, and known in a logically prevolitional way, then the Reformed must reject that as inconsistent with **aseity**, **simplicity**, and the exhaustive scope of the **decree**. So a carefully qualified “Molinist logic” can be used without embracing Molinist metaphysics.

The modern revival and reshaping of Molinism occurs largely in analytic philosophy of religion, where William Lane Craig (b. 1949) is the dominant contemporary figure. Craig’s project is explicitly apologetic and philosophical. In books like The Only Wise God and his later works, he argues that Molinism provides the most powerful model to reconcile divine foreknowledge with libertarian freedom, to give a morally satisfying account of the problem of evil, and to defend a robust doctrine of providence. Unlike Molina, Craig is a Protestant, often evangelical, and deploys middle knowledge in service of doctrines like meticulous providence over history and a strong doctrine of inspiration and prophecy.

Craig’s contribution intensifies several debates. First, he gives the most elaborate defense of the so‑called grounding objection. Critics argue that if counterfactuals of libertarian freedom are true prior to any decree, then there must be some truthmaker for these propositions. Yet libertarianism denies that future free acts are determined by character, nature, or prior causes. So what grounds them? Are they brute facts? If so, they are seemingly metaphysical realities independent of God, which violates **aseity** and seems to introduce an almost Platonic realm of creaturely possibilities that God simply finds. Craig replies that such counterfactuals are grounded in the creatures’ essences as known by God and in his omniscient grasp of what a person would do in any situation. But this response faces a dilemma. Either those essences and their modal profile are within God’s control, in which case the counterfactuals depend on the decree and are not prevolitional, or they are not within God’s control, in which case we again compromise aseity. The Reformed interlocutor will emphasize that on a strong doctrine of **divine ideas**, all creaturely essences are within God and are as they are because of him. No creaturely essence exists as a brute given to which God must conform.

Second, Craig leverages Molinism for the problem of evil. God, he claims, surveys all possible worlds and all feasible worlds, where feasibility is defined by the set of true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. God cannot actualize just any possible world, but only those consistent with what creatures would do. Among those feasible worlds, he selects a world which contains the optimal balance of moral and natural evil relative to the goods achieved. Thus horrendous evils can be morally justified if they occur in a world that, given creaturely freedom, is the best feasible option for God’s purposes. Craig applies this model as well to the distribution of the gospel, arguing that God may have ordered history so that all who never receive the gospel are people who, even if they had received it, would not have believed. Examiners may push: does this not entail a form of theological fatalism where every failure to receive grace is baked into an unchangeable pattern of counterfactuals? Craig answers that the pattern is fixed by creaturely freedom, not by God’s decree, and that grace remains genuinely sufficient and universally well meant. Yet from a Reformed standpoint this appears to relocate the hard edges of election into the opaque landscape of counterfactuals rather than into a transparent divine decree.

Third, Craig uses Molinism to address Trinitarian and Christological puzzles, for instance explaining how God can plan the incarnation or ensure that Jonah goes to Nineveh without violating freedom. Here a Reformed critic can acknowledge that the counterfactual framework clarifies many instances of contingent divine planning, but still deny that this requires a logically middle layer of knowledge independent of the decree. God foreordains the ends and uses means, including free agents, whose acts he has ordained in a way that does not coerce but ensures their occurrence. Within such a compatibilist framework, God’s knowledge of counterfactuals is simply his knowledge of what creatures would do if he decreed such circumstances, which collapses them back into either natural or free knowledge.

The internal debates among Molinists and quasi‑Molinists focus particularly on freedom and truthmakers. Some, influenced by Robert Adams or Alvin Plantinga, try to soften libertarianism, suggesting that God’s knowledge of counterfactuals might be grounded in his knowledge of creaturely essences plus his own decision to actualize certain worlds, rendering the prevolitional status of middle knowledge more ambiguous. Others consider “modified Molinism” where God weakly actualizes certain freedom‑patterns, leaving more room for divine determination. But such moves either concede significant terrain to Thomist or Reformed **compatibilism**, or they threaten to undermine the core Molinist desire to describe freedom as categorical power for alternatives independent of divine determination.

External to the Molinist camp, open theism and simple-foreknowledge Arminianism propose rival ways to protect libertarian freedom. Open theists reject exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingents. God knows all that can be known, but future free acts are not yet truths to be known; they are possibilities. This avoids grounding problems but at the cost of classical omniscience and prophetic certainty. Arminians who affirm simple foreknowledge, by contrast, maintain that God knows the future infallibly but without a middle logical moment; he simply has direct temporal knowledge of what will in fact occur. This yields limited providential control, since foreknowledge alone does not empower God to ensure that specific free choices occur. Molinists claim to outflank both parties: they keep exhaustive definite foreknowledge and coordinative providence without determinism. The Reformed response is that this victory is illusory, because the metaphysical cost in terms of **aseity** and **simplicity** is too high, and the protection of freedom is defined in libertarian terms that are themselves dubious and hard to reconcile with biblical depictions of divine rule.

A Westminster candidate must be prepared to defend an integrated position that spans these loci. The position defended here is that classical Molinism, as defined by a prevolitional, independent set of contingent counterfactuals of libertarian freedom used by God to select a world, is incompatible with **classical theism** and with Reformed doctrines of **decree**, **providence**, and **grace**. At the same time, one can affirm that God truly knows counterfactuals and may govern through them, without conceding the Molinist structure. On a Reformed account, God possesses **analogical knowledge** of all possibilities by his natural knowledge, grounded in his own omnipotence and the **divine ideas**. He also possesses free knowledge of all actualities, grounded in his eternal decree. Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom can be understood as either possible conditional truths within natural knowledge or as truths about what would happen were God to decree certain conditions. Their truth is ultimately grounded in the divine will and wisdom, not in autonomous creaturely essences.

When pressed with the familiar charge, “Does that not make God the author of sin,” the Reformed compatibilist draws on the distinction between primary and secondary causality and between God’s willing of sin as event and his abhorrence of sin as evil. God ordains that Judas betray Christ, yet Judas acts voluntarily and wickedly. There is no neutral space of counterfactuals outside the decree which forces God’s hand. Rather, God’s holy will comprehends and ordains history in such a way that creaturely responsibility is preserved by the fact that secondary causes act out of their own desires and inclinations. In this context, libertarian freedom is not needed to ground responsibility; instead, responsibility is grounded in voluntariness, knowledge, and the fact that the agent acts according to his own reasons.

Finally, contemporary discussions invite questions about how all this bears on prayer, guidance, mission, and pastoral counsel. Here, a measured use of insights from Molinist discussions can be helpful. When teaching that God can answer a particular prayer by arranging a complex web of free decisions, one can speak in counterfactual terms: God knew that if you prayed, he would orchestrate circumstances so that certain people would freely respond in certain ways. Yet the metaphysical ground for that confidence is not an autonomous bank of counterfactuals but the comprehensive, wise, and good **decree** of a God whose **simplicity** and **aseity** secure, rather than threaten, his intimate involvement with secondary causes. In oral examination, one must show the ability to appropriate the clarifying, modal, and logical tools that Molinist debates have developed, while firmly rejecting the Molinist attempt to place contingent truths of creaturely freedom outside God’s decretive control. The cost of that attempt is too high: it corrodes the Creator–creature distinction and silently introduces independent structures of possibility over against the absolute lordship of the triune God.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **middle knowledge** is the alleged logically middle moment in God’s knowledge, prior to decree, in which he knows contingent counterfactuals of libertarian creaturely freedom that are not determined by his will but which he uses to select which world to actualize.
- Decisive figures:
  - Luis de Molina: Jesuit architect of Molinism; defended middle knowledge to reconcile grace and libertarian freedom.
  - Francisco Suárez: systematized Molinism, refining **divine concurrence** and grounding of counterfactuals.
  - Domingo Báñez: Thomist critic; defended physical premotion and rejected middle knowledge as compromising **aseity** and **simplicity**.
  - Jacobus Arminius: Protestant adopter of a Molinist foreknowledge structure to deny unconditional election.
  - William Lane Craig: contemporary analytic and apologetic defender of Molinism; developed responses to the grounding objection and applied Molinism to evil and providence.
- Debates:
  - Internal: how to ground counterfactuals, the exact nature of libertarian freedom, and modified or weakened Molinisms.
  - External: Thomist and Reformed **compatibilism** versus Molinist libertarianism; open theism and simple-foreknowledge Arminianism as rival solutions to foreknowledge and freedom.
  - Contemporary: grounding objection, coherence with **classical theism**, problem of evil and the distribution of salvation, Trinitarian and Christological planning, pastoral use in prayer and guidance.
- Defended position: Classical Molinism, with prevolitional, decree-independent contingent counterfactuals of libertarian freedom, is incompatible with **classical theism** and Reformed **decree** and **providence**; yet counterfactual reasoning and some logical tools from Molinist debates can be retained within a thoroughly Reformed, non-Molinist framework that grounds all truths in God’s will and knowledge.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Is there any version of Molinism compatible with Reformed theology? Only if “Molinism” is reduced to the innocuous claim that God knows and uses counterfactuals; the distinctive prevolitional, independent counterfactuals must be rejected.
  - How do you answer the grounding objection to middle knowledge? Counterfactuals cannot be grounded in autonomous creaturely essences without denying **aseity**; on a Reformed view they are grounded in God’s **divine ideas** and **decree**.
  - Does rejecting Molinism force you into hard determinism and destroy responsibility? No; Reformed **compatibilism** grounds responsibility in voluntary action and secondary causality, not in libertarian freedom.
  - How does God know counterfactuals on your view? As part of his **natural knowledge** of possibilities within his power and as aspects of his **free knowledge** of what he has decreed; there is no independent middle logical moment.
  - What use, if any, do you see in Molinism? It sharpens our handling of counterfactuals, providence, and modal reasoning, but its core metaphysical claim about middle knowledge must be rejected.
