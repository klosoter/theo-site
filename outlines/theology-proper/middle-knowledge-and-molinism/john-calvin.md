# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin firmly rejected the concept of **middle knowledge** and the broader framework of **Molinism**, emphasizing instead the absolute sovereignty of God over all things, including human decisions. For Calvin, God's **decree** is exhaustive and unconditional, leaving no room for hypothetical divine knowledge of counterfactuals independent of God's will. Calvin's theology upholds **divine omniscience** and **predestination** as central, denying any notion that human freedom could limit or condition God's knowledge or decree.

- "For God so attends to the regulation of individual events, and they all so proceed from his set plan, that nothing takes place by chance." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, I.xvi.4)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 16–18)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on Romans (notably Romans 9)
- Sermons on Ephesians
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)
- Calvin and the Reformed Tradition: On the Work of Christ and the Order of Salvation (Richard Muller)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty is Exhaustive**
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all things, including human actions.
    - There is no realm of possibility outside God’s decree.
    - Human history unfolds according to God’s eternal plan.
    - Calvin rejects any notion that God’s knowledge is contingent on creaturely choices.
    - "Nothing, therefore, happens unless the Lord ordain it." (Institutes I.xvi.6)

2. **Denial of Middle Knowledge**
    - Calvin does not affirm a category of knowledge between natural and free knowledge.
    - God’s knowledge is not dependent on hypothetical human decisions.
    - All possibilities are grounded in God’s will, not in autonomous creaturely freedom.
    - The concept of God knowing what free creatures would do, apart from his decree, is foreign to Calvin.
    - "They do not consider that the will of God is the chief and principal cause of all things." (Institutes I.xviii.1)

3. **Predestination is Unconditional**
    - Election and reprobation are based solely on God’s good pleasure.
    - Human merit or foreseen faith plays no role in God’s choice.
    - God’s decree precedes and determines all outcomes.
    - Calvin opposes any system that makes predestination contingent on human acts.
    - "God, by his eternal and immutable counsel, determined once for all those whom it was his pleasure one day to admit to salvation." (Institutes III.xxi.7)

4. **Human Freedom is Compatibilist**
    - Human choices are real but always under God’s sovereign control.
    - Freedom is not autonomy from God but the ability to act according to one’s nature.
    - Calvin denies libertarian free will as required by Molinism.
    - God’s providence and human responsibility are compatible, not mutually exclusive.
    - "Man, when he sins, does so by the will of God, but he sins of his own accord." (Institutes I.xviii.1)

5. **Divine Omniscience is Simple and Eternal**
    - God knows all things—actual and possible—by knowing himself.
    - There is no succession or contingency in God’s knowledge.
    - God’s knowledge is not discursive or dependent on external realities.
    - Calvin rejects any division in God’s knowledge that would imply change or dependence.
    - "God foresees future events only in consequence of his decree." (Institutes III.xxiii.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s rejection of **middle knowledge** and **Molinism** has profoundly shaped the **Reformed tradition’s** understanding of divine sovereignty and providence. His insistence on the primacy of God’s will and the exhaustive nature of the divine decree remains foundational for Reformed theology, setting it apart from both Roman Catholic and Arminian approaches. Calvin’s influence endures in contemporary debates over **predestination**, **providence**, and the relationship between divine and human agency.
