# Luis de Molina (1535–1600)

Luis de Molina was a pivotal figure in the development of **Molinism**, a theological system that sought to reconcile **divine sovereignty** and **human free will** through the concept of **middle knowledge** (scientia media). Molina argued that God possesses knowledge not only of all possible worlds and actual events, but also of what any free creature would do in any given circumstance, thus providing a nuanced account of **predestination** and **providence**.

- "God, by means of His middle knowledge, sees infallibly what every free creature would do under any given circumstance." (Concordia, Part IV, Disputation 52)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Middle Knowledge (Scientia Media)**
    - God knows not only all possibilities and actualities, but also all conditional future contingents.
    - This knowledge is logically situated between **natural knowledge** (possible worlds) and **free knowledge** (actual world).
    - Middle knowledge allows God to foresee what free creatures would choose in any hypothetical situation.
    - It preserves both divine omniscience and genuine human freedom.
    - "Through middle knowledge, God knows what every possible creature would freely do in any given set of circumstances." (Concordia, Disputation 52)

2. **Libertarian Free Will**
    - Human choices are genuinely free and not determined by prior causes or divine decree.
    - Free will is essential for moral responsibility and authentic love of God.
    - Divine grace enables but does not necessitate human cooperation.
    - God's providence works in harmony with, not in violation of, human freedom.
    - "The liberty of the will is not destroyed by the efficacy of divine grace." (Concordia, Disputation 53)

3. **Divine Sovereignty and Providence**
    - God sovereignly ordains the actual world by choosing from among all possible worlds foreseen through middle knowledge.
    - Providence is exercised without coercing or overriding creaturely freedom.
    - God’s governance is meticulous, yet compatible with contingency and freedom.
    - Predestination is based on God’s foreknowledge of free choices, not an unconditional decree.
    - "God predestines no one unless He foresees, by middle knowledge, that he would freely cooperate with grace." (Concordia, Disputation 53)

4. **Rejection of Determinism**
    - Molina opposes both theological and philosophical determinism.
    - Human actions are not necessitated by divine foreknowledge or decree.
    - Contingency is real and essential to the created order.
    - Divine knowledge does not entail causal determination of human acts.
    - "Divine foreknowledge does not impose necessity on future contingents." (Concordia, Disputation 47)

5. **Compatibility with Catholic Doctrine**
    - Molinism is presented as a mediating position within Catholic debates on grace and free will.
    - It seeks to uphold the Council of Trent’s affirmation of both grace and freedom.
    - The system avoids both Pelagianism and strict Augustinian predestinarianism.
    - Molina’s views were subject to scrutiny but remained within the bounds of Catholic orthodoxy.
    - "Our doctrine preserves both the efficacy of divine grace and the liberty of the human will." (Concordia, Proemium)

## Legacy and Impact

Molina’s articulation of **middle knowledge** profoundly shaped subsequent debates on **divine foreknowledge**, **predestination**, and **free will**, especially within Roman Catholic and later Protestant thought. Molinism became a central reference point in discussions of **theodicy** and the compatibility of providence with freedom. While controversial in his own time, Molina’s framework continues to influence contemporary analytic philosophy of religion and remains a significant alternative to both Thomist and Reformed accounts of sovereignty and freedom.
