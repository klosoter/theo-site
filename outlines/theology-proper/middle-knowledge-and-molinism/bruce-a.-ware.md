# Bruce A. Ware (1953– )

Bruce A. Ware is a leading contemporary evangelical theologian who critically engages with **Molinism** and the doctrine of **middle knowledge** from a distinctly **Reformed** perspective. He contends that **middle knowledge** undermines the biblical portrayal of **divine sovereignty** and **meticulous providence**, instead advocating for a robust model of **compatibilism** in which God's exhaustive foreknowledge and sovereign will are fully compatible with genuine human responsibility.

- "Molinism’s notion of middle knowledge, while ingenious, is both biblically unsubstantiated and theologically problematic." (God’s Greater Glory)

## Key Works

- God’s Greater Glory: The Exalted God of Scripture and the Christian Faith (2004)
- "Defining Evangelicalism’s Boundaries Theologically: Is Open Theism Evangelical?" in Beyond the Bounds (2003)
- "Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility: Biblically and Theologically Inseparable" in Still Sovereign (2000)
- "Molinism and the Problem of Evil: A Reformed Critique" (various lectures and essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge**
    - Argues that **middle knowledge** lacks clear biblical support.
    - Claims it introduces a speculative category between **God’s natural and free knowledge**.
    - Asserts that it undermines the **sovereignty** of God by making His decree contingent on creaturely choices.
    - Maintains that Scripture presents God as the ultimate determiner of all events.
    - "Nowhere does Scripture teach that God knows what free creatures would do apart from his own determination." (God’s Greater Glory)

2. **Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty**
    - Emphasizes God’s exhaustive control over all things, including human decisions.
    - Insists that God’s will is ultimate and not dependent on human libertarian freedom.
    - Sees **compatibilism** as the biblical model for relating divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
    - Critiques Molinism for compromising the **Reformed** doctrine of providence.
    - "God’s sovereignty is not threatened by human freedom, rightly understood." (God’s Greater Glory)

3. **Critique of Libertarian Free Will**
    - Argues that libertarian freedom is philosophically and biblically untenable.
    - Maintains that human responsibility does not require the power of contrary choice.
    - Suggests that libertarianism leads to a diminished view of God’s providence.
    - Proposes that biblical freedom is best understood as acting according to one’s nature and desires.
    - "The Bible never grounds moral responsibility in the ability to do otherwise." (God’s Greater Glory)

4. **Scriptural Sufficiency and Authority**
    - Prioritizes biblical exegesis over philosophical speculation in doctrinal formulation.
    - Criticizes Molinism for relying on extra-biblical categories.
    - Argues that Scripture presents only two modes of divine knowledge: natural and free.
    - Stresses the need for theological models to be rooted in the text of Scripture.
    - "Our theology must be shaped by Scripture, not by philosophical constructs foreign to the Bible." (God’s Greater Glory)

5. **Providence and the Problem of Evil**
    - Holds that God ordains all things, including evil, for wise and holy purposes.
    - Rejects the Molinist claim that middle knowledge better accounts for the existence of evil.
    - Argues that God’s sovereign decree is compatible with genuine human culpability.
    - Affirms that God’s glory is displayed even in His sovereign governance over evil.
    - "God’s providence extends to all things, even the sinful actions of creatures, without Himself being the author of sin." (God’s Greater Glory)

## Legacy and Impact

Bruce A. Ware’s critique of **Molinism** and defense of **Reformed compatibilism** have significantly shaped contemporary evangelical discussions on **divine sovereignty** and **human freedom**. His work has provided a robust exegetical and theological alternative to middle knowledge theories, reinforcing the centrality of Scripture in doctrinal debates. Ware’s influence is evident in ongoing conversations about the boundaries of evangelical orthodoxy and the nature of God’s providence.
