# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame critically engages **middle knowledge** and **Molinism** from a distinctly **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the incompatibility of Molinist views with the doctrines of **divine sovereignty** and **meticulous providence**. He argues that the Molinist attempt to reconcile **human freedom** with **God’s exhaustive foreknowledge** undermines the biblical teaching of God’s comprehensive control over all events.

- "Molinism’s ‘middle knowledge’ is not only unscriptural, but also unnecessary for a robust doctrine of God’s sovereignty." (Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- No Other God: A Response to Open Theism (2001)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- Perspectives on the Doctrine of God (various essays)
- "Divine Knowledge" in The Collected Shorter Theological Writings

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Knowledge is Exhaustive and Simple**
    - God knows all things—actual and possible—by virtue of His own decree.
    - There is no real distinction between God’s knowledge of possibilities and actualities.
    - God’s knowledge is not dependent on creaturely decisions.
    - The simplicity of God’s knowledge precludes a "middle" category.
    - "God’s knowledge is not divided into parts, but is one simple act." (Doctrine of God)

2. **Rejection of Libertarian Free Will**
    - Frame denies that human freedom requires the power of contrary choice.
    - He affirms **compatibilism**: human choices are free and responsible, yet determined by God’s sovereign will.
    - Molinism’s libertarianism is seen as unbiblical and philosophically problematic.
    - True freedom is acting according to one’s nature under God’s providence.
    - "Scripture never teaches that human freedom is incompatible with divine sovereignty." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Divine Sovereignty is Comprehensive**
    - God ordains whatsoever comes to pass, including all creaturely decisions.
    - There is no area of reality outside God’s sovereign decree.
    - Molinism’s attempt to preserve contingency undermines God’s exhaustive control.
    - Providence is meticulous, not merely general or permissive.
    - "Nothing happens outside the plan and purpose of God." (Doctrine of God)

4. **Scriptural Authority over Philosophical Systems**
    - Frame insists that theology must be normed by Scripture, not speculative philosophy.
    - He critiques Molinism for relying on extra-biblical categories.
    - The Bible presents God as both sovereign and relational without recourse to middle knowledge.
    - Philosophical constructs must be subordinate to biblical revelation.
    - "We must not allow philosophical speculation to override the clear teaching of Scripture." (No Other God)

5. **God’s Decree Grounds All Possibility**
    - All possible worlds are grounded in God’s will and decree, not in abstract possibilities.
    - God’s knowledge of counterfactuals is based on His sovereign plan, not on creaturely autonomy.
    - There is no "middle knowledge" between natural and free knowledge in God.
    - God’s decree determines what is possible and actual.
    - "God’s decree is the ultimate explanation for all that is or could be." (Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s critique of **Molinism** has reinforced the Reformed commitment to **divine sovereignty** and the sufficiency of Scripture in doctrinal formulation. His work has shaped contemporary Reformed responses to philosophical theology, especially regarding the compatibility of God’s providence and human responsibility. Frame’s insistence on the primacy of biblical categories over speculative systems continues to influence evangelical and Reformed discussions on the nature of God’s knowledge and providence.
