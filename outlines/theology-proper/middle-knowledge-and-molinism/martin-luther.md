# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther firmly rejected the concept of **middle knowledge** and the broader framework of **Molinism**, emphasizing instead the absolute sovereignty of **God’s will** and the bondage of the human will after the Fall. For Luther, any attempt to posit a realm of hypothetical divine knowledge independent of God's decree undermines the doctrines of **predestination** and **divine omnipotence**. He saw human freedom as radically limited, with salvation and all events ultimately determined by God's sovereign choice.

- "For if we believe it to be true that God foreknows and predestines all things, He can neither be deceived nor hindered in His foreknowledge and predestination." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Key Works

- The Bondage of the Will (De Servo Arbitrio)
- Lectures on Romans
- Commentary on Galatians
- Luther’s Small and Large Catechisms
- Martin Luther’s Basic Theological Writings (ed. Timothy Lull)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Denial of Middle Knowledge**
    - Luther rejects any notion of a divine knowledge of counterfactuals independent of God's will.
    - He insists that all knowledge in God is identical with His will and decree.
    - The idea of God foreseeing what free creatures would do apart from His determination is foreign to Luther’s theology.
    - Middle knowledge is seen as a threat to the sovereignty of God in salvation and providence.
    - "God does not foreknow contingently, but He foresees, purposes, and does all things according to His own immutable, eternal, and infallible will." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Absolute Divine Sovereignty**
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all things, including human actions.
    - There is no event or choice outside the scope of God's sovereign decree.
    - Human history unfolds according to God's predetermined plan.
    - Any limitation of God’s sovereignty, such as posited by Molinism, is unacceptable to Luther.
    - "Everything that happens, happens not only by the permission of God, but by His will." (The Bondage of the Will)

3. **Bondage of the Human Will**
    - After the Fall, human will is enslaved to sin and cannot choose good apart from divine grace.
    - Free will, as conceived by Molinists, is a fiction according to Luther.
    - Salvation is entirely the work of God, not a cooperative act between God and man.
    - Human choices are real but always subject to God’s sovereign determination.
    - "Free choice is nothing but a slave of sin, death, and Satan." (The Bondage of the Will)

4. **Predestination and Election**
    - God elects individuals to salvation apart from any foreseen merit or decision.
    - Predestination is rooted in God’s inscrutable will, not in His knowledge of future contingencies.
    - Assurance of salvation rests in God’s promise, not in human response.
    - The doctrine of election is meant to comfort believers by grounding salvation in God alone.
    - "It is not in our power to change, much less to resist, the will of God, which rules our wills as He pleases." (The Bondage of the Will)

5. **Critique of Scholasticism and Speculation**
    - Luther opposes speculative theology that seeks to harmonize divine sovereignty with libertarian freedom.
    - He critiques the use of **philosophical categories** (like those in Molinism) to explain divine action.
    - The mystery of God’s will should be approached with humility, not rationalistic systems.
    - True theology begins with God’s revelation, not with abstract speculation about possible worlds.
    - "Let us rather adore the mysteries of His majesty than investigate them." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s uncompromising stance on the **sovereignty of God** and the **bondage of the will** decisively shaped the Reformation’s rejection of any mediating knowledge between God’s decree and human action. His critique of speculative approaches like Molinism influenced later **Reformed theology** and set a trajectory for debates on divine providence and human freedom. Luther’s legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on God’s initiative in salvation and the limits of human autonomy before divine grace.
