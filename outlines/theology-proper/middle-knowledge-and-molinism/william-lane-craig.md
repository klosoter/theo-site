# William Lane Craig (1949–)

William Lane Craig is the foremost contemporary defender of **Molinism**, a theological system that centers on **middle knowledge** as a means of reconciling **divine sovereignty** and **human freedom**. Craig argues that God's knowledge of all possible worlds, including what free creatures would do in any circumstance, undergirds a robust account of **providence** without lapsing into determinism.

- "On Molinism, God knows what any possible person would freely do in any possible set of circumstances and so can sovereignly direct the course of history by deciding which circumstances to actualize." ("The Only Wise God")

## Key Works

- "The Only Wise God: The Compatibility of Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom" (1987)
- "Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom: The Coherence of Theism: Omniscience" (1991)
- "God, Time, and Knowledge" (2001)
- "Molinism: A Middle Knowledge Perspective" (in "Four Views on Divine Providence," 2011)
- "Middle Knowledge: A Calvinist-Arminian Rapprochement?" (Westminster Theological Journal, 2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Middle Knowledge as God's Knowledge of Counterfactuals**
    - God possesses **middle knowledge** (scientia media) logically prior to His creative decree.
    - This knowledge includes all true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.
    - Middle knowledge is distinct from **natural knowledge** (knowledge of all possibilities) and **free knowledge** (knowledge of actualities).
    - It enables God to know what any free creature would do in any possible circumstance.
    - "God’s middle knowledge is His knowledge of what every possible person would freely do in any possible set of circumstances." ("The Only Wise God")

2. **Libertarian Freedom is Essential**
    - Human beings possess **libertarian freedom**, meaning their choices are not determined by prior causes or divine decree.
    - This freedom is necessary for genuine moral responsibility.
    - Molinism preserves human freedom while maintaining God's exhaustive foreknowledge.
    - Divine providence operates through, not in spite of, creaturely freedom.
    - "If human freedom is to be preserved, then God’s providence must be exercised through His middle knowledge." ("The Only Wise God")

3. **Divine Sovereignty and Providence**
    - God sovereignly ordains the actual world by choosing which possible world to actualize.
    - Through middle knowledge, God ensures the fulfillment of His purposes without violating human freedom.
    - God's providence is meticulous, extending to all events, including free actions.
    - This model avoids both **fatalism** and **open theism**.
    - "God’s providence is so complete that even the free decisions of creatures fall within its scope." ("Four Views on Divine Providence")

4. **Rejection of Simple Foreknowledge and Determinism**
    - Simple foreknowledge (God knowing the future without middle knowledge) is inadequate for providence.
    - Deterministic models (e.g., classical Calvinism) undermine genuine human freedom.
    - Middle knowledge provides a mediating position between Arminianism and Calvinism.
    - Craig critiques both open theism and strict determinism as theologically deficient.
    - "Molinism offers a way between the Scylla of determinism and the Charybdis of indeterminism." ("Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom")

5. **Scriptural and Philosophical Defense of Molinism**
    - Craig appeals to biblical texts suggesting both divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
    - He employs philosophical arguments to defend the coherence of middle knowledge.
    - Molinism is presented as the best explanation for prophecy, prayer, and providence.
    - Craig addresses common objections, such as the grounding objection to counterfactuals.
    - "Molinism is not only biblically plausible but also philosophically robust." ("The Only Wise God")

## Legacy and Impact

Craig's advocacy has revived serious philosophical and theological interest in **Molinism** within analytic theology and evangelical circles. His work has shaped contemporary debates on **divine foreknowledge**, **providence**, and **human freedom**, providing a systematic alternative to both Calvinist and Arminian paradigms. While critics challenge the coherence of middle knowledge, Craig's rigorous defense has made Molinism a significant option in modern discussions of the doctrine of God.
