# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not articulate **middle knowledge** or **Molinism** as later defined, but his doctrine of **divine omniscience**, **providence**, and **predestination** laid essential groundwork for later debates. Aquinas maintained that God knows all things—actual and possible—through His own essence, but he did not posit a distinct category of knowledge between **natural** and **free knowledge**. His views on **divine foreknowledge** and **human freedom** influenced subsequent discussions, including the development of Molinism.

- "God knows all things that are or that can be, whether they exist in act or only in potentiality." (Summa Theologiae I, q.14, a.9)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I, qq. 14, 19, 22–23
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book I, chs. 65–67, 83–89
- De Veritate, q.2, a.12
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book I, dist. 38
- Brian Davies, The Thought of Thomas Aquinas (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Knowledge is Simple and Eternal**
    - God’s knowledge is not discursive but is identical with His essence.
    - All things are known by God in a single, eternal act.
    - There is no temporal succession in God’s knowing.
    - God’s knowledge encompasses all possibilities and actualities.
    - "God knows all things by knowing Himself." (Summa Theologiae I, q.14, a.7)

2. **Distinction Between Necessary and Free Knowledge**
    - Aquinas distinguishes between God’s knowledge of necessary truths (**natural knowledge**) and contingent events (**free knowledge**).
    - God knows necessary truths by necessity, and contingent truths by His will.
    - There is no explicit third category (i.e., middle knowledge).
    - God’s knowledge of future contingents is grounded in His causality.
    - "God knows future contingent things in their causes." (Summa Theologiae I, q.14, a.13)

3. **Divine Providence and Human Freedom**
    - God’s providence orders all things to their end.
    - Human acts are truly free, yet fall under divine providence.
    - God moves secondary causes without violating their nature.
    - The compatibility of providence and freedom is maintained without recourse to middle knowledge.
    - "Divine providence does not destroy contingency in things." (Summa Contra Gentiles I, ch. 67)

4. **Predestination and Foreknowledge**
    - God’s predestination is based on His eternal knowledge and will.
    - God’s foreknowledge includes all that will happen, including free acts.
    - Predestination does not depend on foreseen merits or choices.
    - God’s knowledge and will are the ultimate basis for election.
    - "Predestination presupposes the foreknowledge of God." (Summa Theologiae I, q.23, a.1)

5. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge as Later Defined**
    - Aquinas does not posit a knowledge of conditional future contingents independent of divine decree.
    - All knowledge of future contingents is rooted in God’s will and causality.
    - The Molinist distinction between natural, middle, and free knowledge is absent in Aquinas.
    - Later Molinism developed in response to perceived gaps in Aquinas’s framework.
    - "God does not know things as if learning them from outside Himself." (Summa Theologiae I, q.14, a.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s robust account of **divine knowledge** and **providence** provided the philosophical and theological context for later debates on **middle knowledge** and Molinism. While he did not articulate Molinism, his distinctions and arguments shaped both Thomist and Molinist responses in the early modern period. His influence persists in contemporary discussions on the compatibility of **divine sovereignty** and **human freedom**.
