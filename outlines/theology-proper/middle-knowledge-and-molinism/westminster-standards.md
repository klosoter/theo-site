# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** reject the framework of **middle knowledge** and **Molinism**, affirming instead the exhaustive sovereignty of God over all things, including human decisions. They uphold a doctrine of **divine foreordination** that leaves no room for contingent knowledge outside of God's eternal decree, emphasizing that God's knowledge and will are inseparable and all-encompassing. The Standards insist that all events, including human choices, are comprehended within God's **decretive will**, without compromising genuine human responsibility.

- "God from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy counsel of his own will, freely, and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass." (Westminster Confession of Faith 3.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 3, 5, and 9)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 12–14)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 7–11)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A.A. Hodge, "The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Decree is Exhaustive and Unconditional**
    - God ordains "whatsoever comes to pass," leaving no events outside his sovereign will.
    - There is no realm of possibility or contingency not encompassed by the divine decree.
    - The decree is not based on foreseen faith or works, but solely on God's counsel.
    - All things are determined according to God's immutable purpose.
    - "God from all eternity did...freely, and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass." (WCF 3.1)

2. **No Room for Middle Knowledge**
    - The Standards do not recognize a category of knowledge (middle knowledge) between natural and free knowledge in God.
    - God’s knowledge is simple, eternal, and identical with his being and will.
    - All future contingencies are known because God has decreed them, not because he foresees them as possible choices.
    - The concept of God knowing counterfactuals of creaturely freedom apart from his decree is explicitly rejected.
    - "God’s knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature." (WCF 2.2)

3. **Compatibilist View of Divine Sovereignty and Human Freedom**
    - Human choices are real and morally significant, yet always within the bounds of God’s decree.
    - The Standards affirm secondary causality: God ordains means as well as ends.
    - Human will is not coerced but acts according to its nature, even as it fulfills God’s purposes.
    - There is no contradiction between divine sovereignty and genuine human responsibility.
    - "Yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures." (WCF 3.1)

4. **Rejection of Conditional Election Based on Foreseen Faith**
    - Election is not grounded in God’s foreknowledge of human decisions or responses.
    - The decree of election is unconditional and rooted in God’s sovereign grace.
    - Molinist attempts to base election on foreseen faith or merit are denied.
    - Assurance is grounded in God’s unchangeable purpose, not in human contingency.
    - "Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God...hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of his mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or good works." (WCF 3.5)

5. **God’s Providence Extends to All Events**
    - God upholds, directs, and governs all creatures and actions.
    - Even the free acts of creatures are subject to God’s providential ordering.
    - Providence is not a response to creaturely autonomy but the outworking of God’s eternal plan.
    - The Standards deny any autonomous sphere of creaturely freedom outside divine providence.
    - "God, in his ordinary providence, maketh use of means, yet is free to work without, above, and against them, at his pleasure." (WCF 5.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have decisively shaped the **Reformed tradition’s** rejection of **Molinism** and **middle knowledge**, reinforcing a robust doctrine of **divine sovereignty** and providence. Their uncompromising stance on God's exhaustive decree has influenced generations of confessional Presbyterian and Reformed theologians, setting clear boundaries against attempts to reconcile divine foreknowledge with libertarian free will. The Standards continue to serve as a touchstone for debates on predestination, providence, and the nature of God's knowledge within classical Reformed theology.
