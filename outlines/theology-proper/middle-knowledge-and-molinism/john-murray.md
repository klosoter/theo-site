# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in the **Reformed tradition** of the twentieth century, firmly rejected **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge** as incompatible with the sovereignty of God. He maintained that God's **omniscience** and **decree** are exhaustive and unconditional, leaving no room for a hypothetical knowledge of creaturely freedom independent of God's will.

- "The concept of a conditional decree based upon a foreseen response is alien to the Reformed faith." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Reformed Faith and Modern Substitutes" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- "The Sovereignty of God" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "Calvin on the Sovereignty of God and Reprobation" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 4)
- "The Decree of God" (in The Westminster Confession of Faith: A Commentary)
- Redemption Accomplished and Applied

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Knowledge is Exhaustive and Simple**
    - God’s knowledge encompasses all things actual and possible, rooted in His own nature.
    - There is no division or sequence in God’s knowledge; it is eternally perfect.
    - God does not acquire knowledge from outside Himself or from creaturely decisions.
    - The idea of a "middle knowledge" posits an unwarranted compartmentalization in God’s omniscience.
    - "God’s knowledge is not dependent upon the will of the creature but upon his own eternal purpose." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Divine Sovereignty Precludes Libertarian Freedom**
    - God’s decree is the ultimate cause of all that comes to pass.
    - Human actions are genuinely responsible but never autonomous from God’s will.
    - Molinism’s assertion of libertarian freedom undermines the biblical doctrine of providence.
    - The Reformed tradition affirms compatibilism, not the freedom required by Molinism.
    - "The will of man is never independent of the will of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Conditional Decrees**
    - God’s decrees are not based on foreseen faith or decisions of creatures.
    - Molinism’s conditional decree is inconsistent with the Reformed understanding of predestination.
    - Election and reprobation are grounded solely in God’s sovereign good pleasure.
    - Any appeal to middle knowledge introduces contingency into God’s eternal purpose.
    - "The decree of God is not conditioned by anything in the creature." (Westminster Confession of Faith: A Commentary)

4. **Providence and Human Responsibility**
    - God ordains all events, yet upholds genuine human responsibility.
    - There is a mystery in the concurrence of divine sovereignty and human action.
    - Molinism’s attempt to resolve this mystery by positing middle knowledge is unnecessary and unbiblical.
    - The Reformed position maintains both divine sovereignty and moral accountability without recourse to Molinism.
    - "Scripture does not resolve the mystery by positing a knowledge in God that is contingent upon man’s will." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Scriptural Authority over Philosophical Systems**
    - The Reformed faith is governed by the authority of Scripture, not speculative philosophy.
    - Molinism arises from philosophical concerns rather than exegetical necessity.
    - The doctrine of God’s decree must be shaped by biblical revelation.
    - Any system that compromises the clarity of Scripture on God’s sovereignty is to be rejected.
    - "We must always subordinate philosophical speculation to the authority of the Word of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s robust defense of **divine sovereignty** and critique of Molinism has shaped contemporary Reformed responses to debates over **middle knowledge**. His insistence on the primacy of Scripture and the coherence of the Reformed doctrine of God continues to influence systematic theology at Westminster and beyond. Murray’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold the integrity of the **Reformed confessions** against philosophical innovations.
