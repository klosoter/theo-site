# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich did not directly engage with **middle knowledge** or **Molinism** in the technical sense developed by Luis de Molina, but his theology addresses the relationship between **divine omniscience**, **human freedom**, and the **structure of reality**. Tillich’s existentialist approach reframes questions of **divine knowledge** and **human agency** within the context of **being-itself** and the **God-world relation**, emphasizing the depth and ambiguity of freedom rather than precise logical formulations.

- "God is being-itself, or the ground of being, and therefore the power of being present in all beings." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as Being-Itself**
    - God is not a being among beings but the ground of all being.
    - This ontological framework shapes Tillich’s understanding of divine knowledge.
    - God’s relation to the world is not competitive or external.
    - The divine "knowledge" is not propositional but existential and participatory.
    - "God does not exist. He is being-itself beyond essence and existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Human Freedom as Existential Freedom**
    - Human freedom is real but always conditioned by existential limits.
    - Freedom is not absolute autonomy but participation in being.
    - The ambiguity of freedom is central to the human condition.
    - Divine knowledge does not negate or override human freedom.
    - "Man is free in the sense that he is able to decide for or against the fulfillment of his destiny." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Classical Omniscience Models**
    - Tillich critiques classical theism’s static view of omniscience.
    - Divine knowledge is dynamic, not a catalog of all possible contingents.
    - God’s knowing is inseparable from God’s being and acting.
    - Middle knowledge is not a category Tillich employs or affirms.
    - "God knows all things as they are rooted in the divine life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **God-World Relation as Correlational**
    - The God-world relation is dialectical, not deterministic.
    - God’s knowledge and human response are mutually involved.
    - Tillich’s method of correlation avoids strict determinism or libertarianism.
    - Divine knowledge is actualized in the existential encounter.
    - "The correlation of man and God is the basis of all theological knowledge." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Ambiguity of Theological Language**
    - Tillich insists on the symbolic nature of all God-talk.
    - Terms like "knowledge" and "freedom" are analogical, not univocal.
    - Theological concepts point to mysteries beyond logical systems.
    - Attempts to systematize divine knowledge (e.g., Molinism) are inherently limited.
    - "Symbol is the only way in which the ultimate can be expressed." (Dynamics of Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential and ontological approach has deeply influenced modern theology’s treatment of **divine omniscience** and **human freedom**, offering a critical alternative to both classical and Molinist frameworks. His emphasis on the **symbolic** and **correlational** nature of theological language has shaped contemporary discussions on the limits of doctrinal precision regarding God’s knowledge. While not engaging middle knowledge directly, Tillich’s work challenges the presuppositions underlying both **Molinism** and its critics, urging theologians to attend to the existential depth of the God-world relation.
