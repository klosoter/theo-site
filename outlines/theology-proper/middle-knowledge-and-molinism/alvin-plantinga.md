# Alvin Plantinga (1932– )

Alvin Plantinga is a leading analytic philosopher of religion who has engaged deeply with **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge**. While not a Molinist himself, Plantinga has explored the coherence and philosophical utility of **middle knowledge** in relation to **divine sovereignty**, **human freedom**, and the **problem of evil**, particularly through his development of the **Free Will Defense**.

- "If God has middle knowledge, then he knows what every possible person would freely do in every possible circumstance." (The Nature of Necessity)

## Key Works

- The Nature of Necessity (1974)
- God, Freedom, and Evil (1974)
- "On Ockham’s Way Out" (Faith and Philosophy, 1986)
- "Self-Profile" in Alvin Plantinga (ed. Tomberlin & van Inwagen, 1985)
- Does God Have a Nature? (1980)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of Libertarian Free Will**
    - Human agents possess genuine **libertarian freedom**.
    - Free actions are not determined by prior causes or divine decree.
    - This freedom is central to Plantinga’s **Free Will Defense** against the logical problem of evil.
    - He maintains that God’s omniscience does not negate human freedom.
    - "A world containing creatures who are significantly free is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all." (God, Freedom, and Evil)

2. **Philosophical Utility of Middle Knowledge**
    - Plantinga sees **middle knowledge** as a useful philosophical tool, especially for addressing the compatibility of **divine foreknowledge** and human freedom.
    - He uses the concept to clarify how God could know counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.
    - Middle knowledge helps explain how God can actualize a world with free creatures.
    - He stops short of fully endorsing Molinism, but finds its framework coherent.
    - "The idea is that God knows, for any possible person and any possible circumstance, what that person would freely do in that circumstance." (The Nature of Necessity)

3. **Divine Sovereignty and Providence**
    - Plantinga affirms that God is **sovereign** and providentially orders creation.
    - He explores how God’s providence can be reconciled with libertarian freedom.
    - Middle knowledge provides a model for God’s providential control without causal determinism.
    - God’s knowledge of counterfactuals allows Him to accomplish His purposes through free agents.
    - "God’s providence is compatible with the existence of free creatures, if he has middle knowledge." (God, Freedom, and Evil)

4. **Free Will Defense and the Problem of Evil**
    - Plantinga’s **Free Will Defense** relies on the possibility of middle knowledge.
    - He argues that God could not guarantee a world with free creatures who never choose evil.
    - Middle knowledge allows God to know all possible outcomes of free choices.
    - This defense addresses the logical problem of evil, not the evidential problem.
    - "It was not within God’s power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil." (God, Freedom, and Evil)

5. **Epistemic Humility Regarding Divine Knowledge**
    - Plantinga acknowledges limits to human understanding of **God’s knowledge**.
    - He is open to the possibility that God’s knowledge transcends human categories.
    - He does not claim to resolve all metaphysical questions about middle knowledge.
    - This humility shapes his approach to philosophical theology.
    - "There are many things about God’s knowledge that we do not and perhaps cannot know." (Does God Have a Nature?)

## Legacy and Impact

Plantinga’s engagement with **middle knowledge** and Molinism has significantly shaped contemporary analytic philosophy of religion, especially discussions of **divine foreknowledge** and **human freedom**. His nuanced use of Molinist categories, without full endorsement, has encouraged both Reformed and non-Reformed scholars to reconsider the coherence of **libertarian freedom** within a theistic framework. Plantinga’s work remains foundational for debates on the **problem of evil** and the philosophical viability of **Molinism**.
