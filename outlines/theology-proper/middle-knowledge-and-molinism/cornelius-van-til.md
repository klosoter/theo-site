# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til firmly rejected **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge**, arguing that such views undermine the **sovereignty of God** and compromise the **Creator-creature distinction**. For Van Til, any attempt to posit a realm of knowledge independent of God's will—such as the counterfactuals of creaturely freedom in Molinism—amounts to an unbiblical concession to **autonomous human reasoning** and a denial of **exhaustive divine sovereignty**.

- "If God does not control whatsoever comes to pass, then man controls it, and we are back to the autonomy of man." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Divine Sovereignty**
    - God’s knowledge and will are the ultimate source and explanation for all reality.
    - There is no realm of possibility or actuality outside of God’s sovereign decree.
    - Middle knowledge posits a hypothetical knowledge in God that is dependent on creaturely freedom, which Van Til rejects.
    - Any compromise on sovereignty leads to a diminished view of God’s lordship.
    - "God does not merely know what men will do; he determines what they will do." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God’s knowledge is qualitatively different from human knowledge.
    - Molinism blurs the distinction by making God’s knowledge partially dependent on creatures.
    - The Reformed tradition insists on the incomprehensibility of God and the analogical nature of human knowledge.
    - Van Til sees any form of middle knowledge as a threat to the transcendence of God.
    - "There is no point of identity between the divine and the human mind." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Rejection of Autonomy**
    - Human autonomy is the root error of non-Reformed systems, including Molinism.
    - Middle knowledge assumes that human choices are self-determined and not exhaustively governed by God.
    - Van Til insists that all human reasoning must be subordinate to divine revelation.
    - Any system that grants autonomy to the creature undermines biblical authority.
    - "The autonomy of man is the root idea of all non-Christian philosophy." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Exhaustive Divine Knowledge**
    - God’s knowledge is not contingent or dependent on anything outside himself.
    - There is no “middle” ground between God’s natural and free knowledge.
    - All possibilities and actualities are comprehended in God’s eternal decree.
    - Middle knowledge introduces contingency into the divine mind, which Van Til rejects.
    - "God’s counsel is the source of possibility itself." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Covenantal Epistemology**
    - All knowledge, including knowledge of possibilities, is covenantally structured by God.
    - Human knowledge is always derivative and dependent on God’s revelation.
    - Molinism’s epistemology is fundamentally rationalistic and fails to honor the covenantal context.
    - True knowledge begins with submission to God’s self-revelation, not abstract speculation.
    - "We must think God’s thoughts after him, not alongside him." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s critique of **Molinism** and **middle knowledge** has shaped Reformed responses to these doctrines, reinforcing a robust commitment to **divine sovereignty** and the **Creator-creature distinction**. His insistence on the antithesis between autonomous and theonomic thought continues to influence contemporary discussions in **Reformed apologetics** and systematic theology. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing rejection of any theological system that compromises the exhaustive sovereignty and self-sufficiency of God.
