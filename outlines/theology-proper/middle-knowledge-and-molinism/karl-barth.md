# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth firmly rejected **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge** as incompatible with a robust doctrine of **divine sovereignty** and **revelation**. For Barth, God's knowledge is not contingent upon creaturely freedom but is grounded in God's own free and sovereign will, as revealed supremely in **Jesus Christ**. He saw attempts to mediate between **divine omniscience** and human autonomy, such as Molinism, as undermining the radical priority of God's self-determination.

- "God’s knowing is not a knowing conditioned by anything outside Himself, but a knowing determined by Himself alone." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge**
    - Barth denies any form of **scientia media** as a compromise of divine freedom.
    - He argues that God’s knowledge is not conditioned by hypothetical creaturely choices.
    - Middle knowledge is seen as an attempt to place God’s will under external constraints.
    - Barth insists that God’s knowledge and will are identical and indivisible.
    - "There is no knowledge of possibilities in God which is not at the same time knowledge of actualities." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

2. **Divine Sovereignty and Freedom**
    - God’s will is the ultimate ground of all reality, including human decisions.
    - Barth resists any system that posits a realm of possibility outside God’s decree.
    - Divine sovereignty is not limited by foreseen human actions.
    - God’s freedom is absolute, not reactive or dependent.
    - "God is free in His grace, and His grace is His freedom." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

3. **Christocentric Revelation**
    - All divine knowledge is centered in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Barth rejects speculative accounts of God’s knowledge apart from revelation in Christ.
    - The knowledge of God is not abstract but personal and redemptive.
    - Christ is the locus of both divine knowing and willing.
    - "In Jesus Christ God reveals Himself as the One who knows and wills." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Critique of Human Autonomy**
    - Barth is critical of any theological system that elevates human freedom over God’s will.
    - He views Molinism as granting too much autonomy to the creature.
    - Human freedom is real but always subordinate to divine sovereignty.
    - True freedom is found only in obedience to God’s revelation.
    - "Man’s freedom is real, but it is the freedom of a creature, not of a co-determiner." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

5. **Revelation over Speculation**
    - Barth prioritizes **revelation** over philosophical speculation in theology.
    - He is wary of metaphysical constructs like middle knowledge that lack biblical grounding.
    - Theology must be governed by God’s self-disclosure, not abstract possibilities.
    - Barth’s method is dogmatic, not philosophical.
    - "Theology must begin with what God has said, not with what man imagines God could know." (Evangelical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s uncompromising emphasis on **divine sovereignty** and **revelation** has made him a central figure in 20th-century theology, especially in debates over **Molinism** and the nature of God’s knowledge. His critique of middle knowledge continues to shape Reformed and Barthian responses to issues of providence and human freedom. Barth’s insistence on the priority of revelation over speculation remains influential in contemporary systematic theology.
