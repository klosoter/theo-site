# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher rejected **middle knowledge** and **Molinism**, emphasizing instead the **absolute divine causality** and the unity of **God’s will** with the world. He grounded **divine omniscience** and **providence** in the immediacy of God’s relationship to creation, opposing speculative philosophical constructs that divide God’s knowledge into logical moments.

- "The divine knowledge is not to be conceived as a sequence of perceptions, but as a single act embracing all things in their unity." (The Christian Faith, §54)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge**
   - Denies the existence of a distinct category of knowledge (**scientia media**) in God.
   - Argues that dividing God’s knowledge into logical moments undermines **divine simplicity**.
   - Sees **Molinism** as an unnecessary philosophical abstraction.
   - Emphasizes the unity and immediacy of **divine omniscience**.
   "The idea of a middle knowledge is foreign to the unity of the divine consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §54)

2. **Absolute Divine Causality**
   - Asserts that all events are grounded in the will and causality of God.
   - Rejects the notion that human choices can be foreknown apart from God’s decree.
   - Maintains that God’s will is the ultimate source of all actuality.
   - Human freedom is real but always within the sphere of **divine causation**.
   "Nothing can be independent of the divine causality, not even the decisions of free beings." (The Christian Faith, §55)

3. **Unity of Divine Will and World Order**
   - God’s will and the world’s order are not separate but intimately united.
   - The **divine decree** is not a sequence but a single, comprehensive act.
   - Opposes any view that posits contingency in the divine will.
   - The world is the necessary expression of God’s perfect will.
   "The world is the revelation of the divine will in its unity and totality." (The Christian Faith, §56)

4. **Critique of Speculative Theologies**
   - Views **Molinism** and similar systems as speculative and detached from Christian experience.
   - Prioritizes the lived experience of faith over abstract philosophical distinctions.
   - Argues that speculative distinctions (like middle knowledge) obscure the immediacy of God’s relationship to creation.
   - Theological reflection must remain rooted in the consciousness of **absolute dependence**.
   "Speculation must not be allowed to obscure the immediacy of our relation to God." (The Christian Faith, §4)

5. **Divine Omniscience as Immediate and Comprehensive**
   - God’s knowledge encompasses all possibilities and actualities in a single act.
   - There is no temporal or logical succession in God’s knowing.
   - Divine knowledge is not conditioned by creaturely decisions.
   - God’s **omniscience** is the ground of all reality, not a response to it.
   "God knows all things in their unity, not as a series of contingent possibilities." (The Christian Faith, §54)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s rejection of **middle knowledge** and Molinism influenced later Protestant theology, especially in its emphasis on the unity of **divine omniscience** and will. His critique of speculative distinctions helped shift theological focus toward the immediacy of religious experience and the absolute dependence of creation on God. While his views diverged sharply from both classical Reformed and Roman Catholic positions, his work remains foundational for modern discussions of **divine providence** and freedom. Schleiermacher’s legacy continues to shape debates over the relationship between God’s knowledge, will, and the world.
