# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The Three Forms of Unity—comprising the **Belgic Confession**, **Heidelberg Catechism**, and **Canons of Dort**—firmly reject **Molinism** and its doctrine of **middle knowledge**. These confessions uphold **divine sovereignty**, **unconditional election**, and the exhaustive **foreknowledge** and **decree** of God, leaving no room for a hypothetical knowledge of future contingents independent of God's will.

- "God, after the most righteous and just judgment, hath left them in their own wickedness and hardness of heart, in which they have involved themselves." (Canons of Dort, I.15)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 13–16
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Lord’s Days 9–10
- Canons of Dort (1619), esp. First Head of Doctrine: Divine Election and Reprobation
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Beeke & Ferguson)
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. Dennison)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty is Absolute**
   - God ordains all things according to His **eternal decree**.
   - Nothing happens apart from His will, including human decisions.
   - There is no contingency outside of God’s sovereign plan.
   - God’s knowledge is not dependent on creaturely freedom.
   "We believe that all things are governed by the providence of God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 13)

2. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge**
   - The confessions do not affirm a category of knowledge between **natural** and **free knowledge**.
   - God’s knowledge is exhaustive and based on His will, not on hypothetical creaturely choices.
   - The idea that God knows what free creatures would do, apart from His decree, is denied.
   - The Canons of Dort explicitly reject all forms of conditional election.
   "Election is the unchangeable purpose of God whereby, before the foundation of the world, He has...chosen in Christ unto salvation a definite number of particular people." (Canons of Dort, I.7)

3. **Unconditional Election**
   - God’s choice is not based on foreseen faith or actions.
   - Election is rooted solely in God’s mercy and sovereign good pleasure.
   - The confessions oppose any notion that God’s decree is conditioned by human will.
   - This directly contradicts the Molinist position of conditional predestination.
   "He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy." (Canons of Dort, I.7)

4. **Providence Encompasses All Events**
   - God upholds and governs all things, including the free acts of creatures.
   - Human freedom operates within, not outside, God’s providence.
   - There is no autonomous sphere of creaturely decision-making.
   - The confessions stress God’s meticulous providence over all creation.
   "Nothing happens in this world without His appointment." (Belgic Confession, Art. 13)

5. **Human Responsibility within Divine Sovereignty**
   - Humans are accountable for their actions, even though God ordains all things.
   - The confessions maintain a compatibilist view of freedom and responsibility.
   - There is no appeal to a libertarian freedom as in Molinism.
   - The mystery of divine sovereignty and human responsibility is affirmed, not resolved by middle knowledge.
   "Man is himself the cause of his own ruin." (Canons of Dort, I.15)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have decisively shaped **Reformed orthodoxy** by rejecting **Molinism** and its doctrine of **middle knowledge**. Their clear articulation of **divine sovereignty**, **unconditional election**, and exhaustive providence has influenced confessional Reformed churches worldwide. These documents continue to serve as a bulwark against attempts to compromise God’s sovereignty with human autonomy, ensuring that the Reformed tradition remains distinct from both Arminian and Molinist systems.
