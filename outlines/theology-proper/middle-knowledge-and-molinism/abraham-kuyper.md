# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper firmly rejected **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge**, regarding them as incompatible with the **Reformed doctrine of divine sovereignty** and **predestination**. He emphasized the exhaustive nature of **God’s decree** and the absolute freedom of the divine will, insisting that all things, including human decisions, fall within the scope of God’s comprehensive providence.

- "The sovereignty of God excludes every form of contingency that would place the creature’s will outside the divine decree." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Key Works

- Principles of Sacred Theology (1898)

- "Common Grace" (Collected Articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge**
    - Denies that God possesses a hypothetical knowledge of what free creatures would do under any circumstance independent of His decree.
    - Argues that **middle knowledge** undermines the absolute sovereignty of God.
    - Sees Molinism as introducing an unacceptable element of contingency into God’s providence.
    - Insists that all creaturely acts are encompassed within God’s eternal plan.
    - "The Reformed faith knows nothing of a knowledge in God that is not rooted in His sovereign will." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Divine Sovereignty Over Human Will**
    - Affirms that God’s will is the ultimate cause of all things, including human choices.
    - Rejects any notion that human freedom can limit or condition God’s decree.
    - Maintains that true freedom is found within the bounds of God’s sovereign purpose.
    - Critiques Molinism for subordinating God’s will to creaturely decisions.
    - "God’s counsel is not dependent upon the will of man, but man’s will is comprehended in God’s counsel." (Lectures on Calvinism)

3. **Comprehensive Divine Decree**
    - Teaches that God’s decree is all-encompassing and leaves no room for autonomous creaturely decisions.
    - Views the decree as logically prior to all knowledge, including knowledge of future contingents.
    - Rejects the Molinist distinction between necessary and contingent knowledge in God.
    - Asserts that God’s knowledge of future events is grounded in His own will.
    - "Nothing can exist or occur outside the scope of God’s eternal decree." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

4. **Critique of Molinist Anthropology**
    - Argues that Molinism overestimates human autonomy and underestimates the effects of sin.
    - Emphasizes the Reformed doctrine of **total depravity** and its impact on the will.
    - Maintains that human choices are always subject to God’s sovereign governance.
    - Warns that Molinism risks a semi-Pelagian view of human ability.
    - "The Reformed confession does not allow for a will in man that is free from the dominion of sin or the sovereignty of God." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

5. **Providence and Contingency**
    - Affirms that all apparent contingencies are ultimately governed by divine providence.
    - Denies that there are any real possibilities outside of what God has decreed.
    - Sees Molinist contingency as a threat to the certainty of God’s promises and purposes.
    - Insists that God’s providence is meticulous and exhaustive.
    - "Providence is not a mere supervision, but a sovereign direction of all things to their appointed end." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust defense of **divine sovereignty** and his critique of **Molinism** have reinforced the Reformed tradition’s rejection of **middle knowledge**. His theological system has shaped Neo-Calvinist thought and continues to influence debates on providence, freedom, and the nature of God’s knowledge. Kuyper’s insistence on the primacy of God’s decree remains a touchstone for confessional Reformed theology, especially in its engagement with competing views of divine foreknowledge and human freedom.
