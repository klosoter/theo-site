# Richard A. Muller (1948– )

Richard A. Muller is a leading historian of **Reformed scholasticism** who has critically examined the development of **divine foreknowledge**, **predestination**, and the debates surrounding **middle knowledge** and **Molinism**. Muller contends that classic Reformed theology rejected **Molinist** formulations of **scientia media**, instead articulating divine knowledge and sovereignty through the categories of **decree** and **necessity**. His scholarship clarifies the historical and conceptual distinctions between **Reformed orthodoxy** and **Jesuit** Molinism.

- "The Reformed orthodox did not adopt a doctrine of scientia media but rather developed their own nuanced accounts of divine knowledge and will." (Divine Will and Human Choice, p. 271)

## Key Works

- Divine Will and Human Choice: Freedom, Contingency, and Necessity in Early Modern Reformed Thought
- Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: The Divine Essence and Attributes
- "God, Predestination, and Middle Knowledge: Some Historical Reflections" (in Westminster Theological Journal 55)
- After Calvin: Studies in the Development of a Theological Tradition

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Molinist Middle Knowledge**
    - Argues that **Reformed orthodoxy** consistently rejected the Jesuit doctrine of **scientia media**.
    - Emphasizes that **God’s knowledge** is not dependent on hypothetical creaturely choices.
    - Asserts that **divine decree** precedes and grounds all possibilities and actualities.
    - Highlights the incompatibility of Molinism with **Reformed views of sovereignty**.
    - "The Reformed did not accept the Molinist notion of a knowledge of future contingents logically prior to the decree." (Divine Will and Human Choice, p. 272)

2. **Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty and Decree**
    - Maintains that **God’s decree** is the ultimate cause of all things, including contingent events.
    - Insists that nothing is outside the scope of **divine providence**.
    - Views **contingency** as compatible with, but subordinate to, the divine will.
    - Rejects any notion that would limit God’s control over history or salvation.
    - "All things, even contingent events, fall within the scope of the divine decree." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3, p. 441)

3. **Distinction Between Necessity and Contingency**
    - Clarifies that **necessity** in God does not eliminate real contingency in creation.
    - Argues that Reformed theologians distinguished between **necessitas consequentiae** and **necessitas consequentis**.
    - Contingent events are certain because of God’s will, not because of an autonomous middle knowledge.
    - This distinction preserves both divine sovereignty and genuine creaturely action.
    - "The Reformed distinguished necessity of the consequence from necessity of the consequent to maintain both divine sovereignty and real contingency." (Divine Will and Human Choice, p. 273)

4. **Historical-Critical Approach to Molinism**
    - Emphasizes the importance of understanding **Molinism** in its original **Jesuit** context.
    - Critiques anachronistic readings that conflate Reformed and Molinist positions.
    - Demonstrates that **Reformed scholastics** engaged Molinism polemically, not constructively.
    - Uses careful historical analysis to clarify doctrinal boundaries.
    - "The Reformed response to Molinism was shaped by polemical context and careful doctrinal distinctions." (After Calvin, p. 150)

5. **Defense of Reformed Orthodoxy’s Coherence**
    - Argues that **Reformed orthodoxy** developed a coherent alternative to Molinism.
    - Highlights the internal consistency of the Reformed account of **divine knowledge** and **human freedom**.
    - Shows that Reformed theologians did not require a mediating knowledge to explain contingency.
    - Defends the sufficiency of the **decree-contingency** framework within Reformed thought.
    - "Reformed orthodoxy offered a robust and coherent doctrine of divine knowledge without recourse to scientia media." (Divine Will and Human Choice, p. 274)

## Legacy and Impact

Muller’s scholarship has decisively shaped contemporary understanding of **Reformed scholasticism** and its relationship to **Molinism**. By clarifying the historical and conceptual boundaries between Reformed and Jesuit approaches to **middle knowledge**, he has corrected many misconceptions in both academic and ecclesiastical circles. His work remains foundational for those studying the development of **divine foreknowledge**, the **decree**, and the nuances of early modern theological debates. Muller's careful historical method continues to influence systematic theology and the historiography of Reformed thought.
