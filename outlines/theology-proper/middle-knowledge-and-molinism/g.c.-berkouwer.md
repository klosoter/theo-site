# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer critically engaged with **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge** from a Reformed perspective, emphasizing the incompatibility of these ideas with the doctrines of **divine sovereignty** and **predestination**. He argued that **middle knowledge** undermines the biblical understanding of **God’s providence** and the **freedom of the divine will**, seeing it as an unnecessary philosophical construct that detracts from the sufficiency of **Scripture**.

- "The concept of middle knowledge is not only foreign to the Reformed confession, but also threatens the very heart of the biblical doctrine of God’s counsel." (Divine Election, p. 93)

## Key Works

- Divine Election (1955)
- Faith and Justification (1954)
- The Providence of God (1952)
- Studies in Dogmatics (series)
- Holy Scripture (1966)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge**
    - Berkouwer viewed **middle knowledge** as a speculative addition to biblical teaching.
    - He argued it introduces a hypothetical realm of possibilities outside of God’s sovereign decree.
    - He maintained that God’s knowledge is not contingent on creaturely freedom.
    - He saw **middle knowledge** as undermining the certainty of **divine providence**.
    - "Molinism’s middle knowledge is a foreign element in the Reformed doctrine of God." (Divine Election, p. 94)

2. **Primacy of Divine Sovereignty**
    - God’s will is the ultimate ground of all that happens.
    - No knowledge or possibility exists outside of God’s sovereign decree.
    - Human freedom is real but always subordinate to **God’s sovereignty**.
    - Any system that limits God’s control over history is rejected.
    - "The sovereignty of God cannot be compromised by philosophical constructions." (Divine Election, p. 95)

3. **Scriptural Sufficiency**
    - Berkouwer insisted that doctrine must be grounded in **Scripture**, not speculative philosophy.
    - He critiqued Molinism for lacking biblical warrant.
    - The Reformed tradition’s emphasis on sola scriptura excludes middle knowledge.
    - The clarity of biblical teaching on **God’s counsel** is sufficient for understanding providence.
    - "Scripture does not speak of a knowledge in God that is dependent on creaturely decisions." (Divine Election, p. 97)

4. **Critique of Libertarian Free Will**
    - Berkouwer rejected the Molinist view of **libertarian freedom** as incompatible with biblical anthropology.
    - He argued that human freedom is always within the bounds of God’s will.
    - The Reformed tradition affirms **compatibilist freedom**.
    - Molinism’s emphasis on autonomous human choice is seen as unbiblical.
    - "The freedom of man is never absolute, but always related to the will of God." (Divine Election, p. 99)

5. **Emphasis on the Mystery of Providence**
    - Berkouwer acknowledged the mystery in the relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
    - He warned against rationalistic attempts to resolve this tension, such as Molinism.
    - The Reformed faith embraces the limits of human understanding regarding God’s ways.
    - Mystery is not a deficiency, but a mark of reverence for divine revelation.
    - "The mystery of God’s counsel is not to be explained away by philosophical systems." (Divine Election, p. 101)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s critique of **middle knowledge** and Molinism has shaped Reformed responses to these doctrines, reinforcing the centrality of **divine sovereignty** and the sufficiency of Scripture. His careful engagement with philosophical theology has encouraged later theologians to resist speculative constructs that lack biblical grounding. Berkouwer’s work remains influential in contemporary discussions of **providence**, election, and the relationship between God’s knowledge and human freedom.
