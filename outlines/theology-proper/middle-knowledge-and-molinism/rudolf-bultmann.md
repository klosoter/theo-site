# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann did not directly engage with **middle knowledge** or **Molinism**, as his theological project was primarily concerned with **demythologization**, **existential interpretation**, and the **hermeneutics** of the New Testament. Bultmann’s approach to divine knowledge and human freedom was shaped by his existentialist framework, which emphasized the encounter with the **kerygma** rather than speculative metaphysics about God's knowledge of counterfactuals. He critiqued traditional metaphysical discussions, focusing instead on the existential significance of faith and decision.

- "We cannot use the results of historical research as a basis for faith, but only as a stimulus to decision." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Scripture must be interpreted existentially, not through speculative metaphysics.
    - Mythological elements are reinterpreted to reveal existential truths.
    - Rejects literal readings of supernatural events in favor of their existential meaning.
    - Focuses on the proclamation (kerygma) rather than metaphysical systems.
    - "The real question is not whether miracles happen, but what the miracle stories say." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Human Freedom**
    - Human freedom is understood in terms of authentic existence before God.
    - Rejects scholastic debates about the mechanics of divine foreknowledge.
    - Emphasizes decision and responsibility in the moment of encounter with the Word.
    - Freedom is not a metaphysical property but an existential reality.
    - "Faith is decision, not assent to propositions." (Existence and Faith)

3. **Critique of Metaphysical Speculation**
    - Suspicious of attempts to define God's knowledge in abstract terms.
    - Sees metaphysical systems like Molinism as distractions from the existential call of the gospel.
    - Argues that faith does not depend on resolving philosophical puzzles.
    - Prioritizes the existential response over theoretical coherence.
    - "Theology must not become a system of thought but must remain interpretation." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is central, not philosophical explanations of divine knowledge.
    - The kerygma confronts individuals with a call to authentic existence.
    - The meaning of revelation is found in existential encounter, not in speculative doctrines.
    - Theological focus is on the transformative event, not on God's hypothetical knowledge.
    - "The kerygma is not a myth but the proclamation of an event." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Historical-Critical Method**
    - Employs critical scholarship to distinguish between myth and existential message.
    - Rejects harmonization of biblical texts with philosophical systems like Molinism.
    - Historical analysis serves to clarify the existential significance of the text.
    - Theological reflection is grounded in the historical Jesus and the apostolic witness.
    - "Historical criticism is not the enemy of faith but its necessary presupposition." (History and Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach redirected modern theology away from **scholastic metaphysics** and toward existential interpretation, making discussions of **middle knowledge** and **Molinism** largely irrelevant within his framework. His influence led to a reevaluation of the relationship between **faith** and **reason**, prioritizing the existential encounter over speculative doctrines. While his work did not address Molinism directly, it shaped subsequent debates about the nature of divine knowledge and human freedom by reframing the terms of the discussion. Bultmann’s legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on **hermeneutics** and the existential dimension of theology.
