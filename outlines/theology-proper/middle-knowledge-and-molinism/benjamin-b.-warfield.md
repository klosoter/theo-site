# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield critically engaged with the concept of **middle knowledge** and the broader system of **Molinism**, emphasizing the incompatibility of such views with the **Reformed doctrine of divine sovereignty** and **predestination**. Warfield maintained that God's knowledge is both **exhaustive** and **causative**, rejecting any notion that would place the divine will in a position of contingency upon creaturely freedom.

- "The Reformed doctrine of the divine decree excludes every form of contingency from the universe." (The Plan of Salvation)

## Key Works

- The Plan of Salvation
- Calvin and Calvinism
- The Westminster Assembly and Its Work
- Biblical and Theological Studies (collected essays)
- Selected Shorter Writings

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Knowledge is Exhaustive and Causative**
    - God’s knowledge encompasses all things actual and possible, rooted in His eternal decree.
    - There is no knowledge in God that is contingent upon the autonomous choices of creatures.
    - Warfield rejects any division of God’s knowledge into **natural**, **middle**, and **free** knowledge as in Molinism.
    - God’s foreknowledge is inseparable from His foreordination.
    - "God foreknows what will be because He has decreed what shall be." (The Plan of Salvation)

2. **Rejection of Libertarian Free Will**
    - Human freedom is understood as **compatibilist**, not libertarian.
    - Molinist accounts of free will undermine the sovereignty of God.
    - Warfield insists that all creaturely acts are encompassed within the divine decree.
    - The will of the creature is never independent of the will of the Creator.
    - "The Reformed doctrine is that God’s decree is the ultimate ground of all that comes to pass." (The Plan of Salvation)

3. **Critique of Middle Knowledge**
    - Middle knowledge posits a hypothetical knowledge of what free creatures would do in any circumstance.
    - Warfield argues this concept is speculative and lacks biblical support.
    - He sees middle knowledge as an attempt to reconcile divine sovereignty with libertarian freedom, which he finds theologically incoherent.
    - Such a view, in Warfield’s estimation, compromises the **immutability** and **aseity** of God.
    - "There is no room in the Reformed system for a knowledge in God that is dependent on the will of the creature." (Calvin and Calvinism)

4. **Divine Sovereignty and Predestination**
    - Warfield upholds the absolute sovereignty of God over all events.
    - Predestination is not based on foreseen faith or actions, but on God’s sovereign will alone.
    - Any system that introduces contingency into God’s decree is rejected.
    - Molinism, by positing middle knowledge, undermines the certainty of God’s purposes.
    - "The Reformed faith is theism come to its rights, and predestination is only the form in which theism asserts itself." (The Plan of Salvation)

5. **Scriptural Authority and Theological Method**
    - Warfield insists that theological constructs must be grounded in the teaching of Scripture.
    - He critiques Molinism for relying on philosophical speculation rather than biblical exegesis.
    - The Reformed tradition, for Warfield, is distinguished by its commitment to sola Scriptura.
    - Any doctrine of divine knowledge must be derived from the biblical witness, not from abstract reasoning.
    - "The Scriptures know nothing of a God who waits upon the determinations of His creatures." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of **divine sovereignty** and his critique of **Molinism** have shaped the contours of Reformed theology in the twentieth century and beyond. His insistence on the incompatibility of **middle knowledge** with the Reformed confessions remains influential in contemporary debates over providence and human freedom. Warfield’s work continues to serve as a touchstone for those defending the classical doctrines of **predestination** and the exhaustive knowledge of God.
