# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Reformed theology** at Princeton, firmly rejected **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge** as incompatible with the doctrines of **divine sovereignty** and **predestination**. He argued that God's knowledge is both **comprehensive** and **causative**, leaving no room for contingent truths outside of God's decree, and saw Molinism as undermining the **absolute sovereignty** of God over all events.

- "The theory of a scientia media is inconsistent with the Scriptural doctrine of the sovereignty of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially chapters on the divine attributes and decrees)
- "The Plan of Salvation" (Princeton Review, 1841)
- Princeton Sermons (sermons on God's sovereignty and providence)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans (sections on election and foreknowledge)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Knowledge is Simple and Eternal**
    - God’s knowledge is not divided into different logical moments or types.
    - All things are known to God from eternity, including contingent events.
    - There is no distinction between **natural**, **free**, or **middle knowledge** in God.
    - God’s knowledge is grounded in His own will and decree.
    - "God knows all things possible and actual, not by a scientia media, but by His own decree." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge**
    - Middle knowledge posits hypothetical knowledge of creaturely freedom independent of God’s will.
    - Hodge saw this as a threat to the **sovereignty** and **independence** of God.
    - He argued that nothing can be known as future except what God has decreed.
    - Molinism introduces contingency and uncertainty into God’s knowledge.
    - "The future is certain to God, because He has determined what shall come to pass." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Divine Sovereignty and Predestination**
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all that happens.
    - Election and reprobation are grounded in God’s sovereign good pleasure, not foreseen faith or actions.
    - Any system that limits God’s control over human choices is rejected.
    - Molinism is seen as a compromise with **Arminianism**.
    - "The Scriptures teach that the purposes of God are not dependent on the will of man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Providence and Human Freedom**
    - Human actions are free in a compatibilist sense, not libertarian.
    - God’s providence extends to all events, including human decisions.
    - There is no event outside the scope of God’s decree.
    - Middle knowledge is unnecessary to account for moral responsibility.
    - "God’s providence is universal, particular, and efficacious." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Scriptural Authority over Philosophical Speculation**
    - Hodge prioritized biblical teaching over philosophical constructs like Molinism.
    - He critiqued middle knowledge as lacking scriptural support.
    - The **Westminster Confession** was his standard for evaluating theological systems.
    - Doctrines must be judged by their fidelity to Scripture, not their philosophical coherence.
    - "The Bible knows nothing of a scientia media." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of **divine sovereignty** and his critique of **Molinism** have shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially within the Princeton tradition. His insistence on the sufficiency of **Scripture** and the confessional standards of the **Westminster Confession** set a benchmark for evaluating speculative theological systems. Hodge’s rejection of middle knowledge remains influential in contemporary Reformed discussions, reinforcing a strong commitment to the doctrines of **predestination** and the comprehensive scope of God’s decree.
