# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not articulate a doctrine of **middle knowledge** or **Molinism** as later developed, but his reflections on **divine foreknowledge**, **predestination**, and **human freedom** laid essential groundwork for later debates. He affirmed that God’s knowledge encompasses all things, including contingent human choices, yet maintained the primacy of **divine sovereignty** over the will. Augustine’s thought thus provides a critical background for understanding the issues that Molinism would later address.

- "For He foreknew what He would Himself do, and what He would do through the free wills of others." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- The City of God
- On the Predestination of the Saints
- On Free Choice of the Will
- Enchiridion

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Foreknowledge is Comprehensive**
    - God knows all events, including future contingents and human decisions.
    - Divine knowledge is not dependent on temporal sequence.
    - God’s foreknowledge does not negate human responsibility.
    - Augustine rejects the idea that God merely foresees rather than ordains.
    - "For He foreknew what He would Himself do, and what He would do through the free wills of others." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

2. **Divine Sovereignty Over Human Will**
    - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all that occurs.
    - Human freedom operates within the bounds of God’s sovereign plan.
    - Predestination is rooted in God’s gracious choice, not foreseen merit.
    - Augustine denies that God’s knowledge is contingent on human action.
    - "For not all men are called, but those who are called are those who are predestined." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

3. **Human Freedom is Real but Subordinate**
    - Humans possess a will capable of choosing.
    - The will is enslaved to sin apart from divine grace.
    - True freedom is found only in the transformation by grace.
    - Human choices are genuinely voluntary, though foreknown by God.
    - "For the will is indeed present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not." (Confessions)

4. **No Middle Knowledge in the Augustinian Framework**
    - Augustine does not posit a category of knowledge between natural and free knowledge.
    - God’s knowledge is simple, eternal, and not divided into logical moments.
    - All knowledge in God is identical with His essence.
    - The concept of God knowing counterfactuals of creaturely freedom is absent.
    - "For God foreknew that He would do these things by means of the wills of men." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

5. **Predestination and Grace are Central**
    - Salvation is entirely the result of God’s gracious initiative.
    - Predestination is not based on foreseen faith or works.
    - Grace is both necessary and effectual for salvation.
    - Human merit plays no role in God’s electing purpose.
    - "For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son." (The City of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s robust doctrine of **divine foreknowledge** and **predestination** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, especially in the Augustinian and Reformed traditions. While he did not develop a theory of **middle knowledge**, his insistence on the compatibility of God’s sovereignty and human will set the stage for later debates, including those addressed by Molinism. His influence persists in ongoing discussions about the relationship between divine omniscience and human freedom.
