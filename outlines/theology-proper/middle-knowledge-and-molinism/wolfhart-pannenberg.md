# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg critically engaged with **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge** from the standpoint of his commitment to the **historicity of revelation** and the **openness of the future**. He questioned the coherence of a divine knowledge of counterfactuals that would undermine genuine human freedom, emphasizing instead the dynamic relationship between **God’s omniscience** and the unfolding of history. Pannenberg’s approach resists static conceptions of divine foreknowledge, favoring a model where **divine knowledge** is intimately linked to the eschatological consummation of history.

- "The future is not yet determined, and therefore not even God can know it as something already fixed." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (1991)
- Theology and the Philosophy of Science (1976)
- Metaphysics and the Idea of God (1990)
- Revelation as History (1968, ed. with R. Rendtorff et al.)
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2 (1971)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Historical and Eschatological**
    - Divine self-disclosure unfolds within the contingencies of history.
    - God’s knowledge is realized in the process of historical events.
    - The future is open and only fully knowable at the eschaton.
    - Middle knowledge is problematic because it presupposes a fixed set of possible worlds.
    - "God’s revelation is not a timeless deposit but an event in history." (Revelation as History)

2. **Critique of Molinist Middle Knowledge**
    - Middle knowledge posits a set of counterfactuals known by God prior to creation.
    - Pannenberg argues this undermines authentic human freedom.
    - He sees Molinism as too speculative and detached from historical reality.
    - Divine knowledge must be consistent with the genuine openness of human decisions.
    - "The Molinist concept of middle knowledge presupposes a determinacy that is foreign to the biblical witness." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Openness of the Future**
    - The future is not exhaustively determined or knowable in advance.
    - God’s omniscience includes all that is knowable, but the future remains contingent.
    - Human actions contribute to the shape of history.
    - Eschatological fulfillment will reveal the full meaning of history and divine knowledge.
    - "The future is open, and only at the end will the whole truth be manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **God’s Omniscience and Human Freedom**
    - Divine omniscience is not compromised by human freedom.
    - God knows all possibilities and actualities as they unfold.
    - Human freedom is real and not illusory or predetermined.
    - God’s knowledge is relational, not mechanistic or abstract.
    - "God’s knowledge is not a static possession but is realized in relation to the world." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

5. **Eschatological Consummation as the Fulfillment of Knowledge**
    - Full knowledge, including the meaning of all events, comes at the eschaton.
    - God’s knowledge is comprehensive, but its fullness is eschatological.
    - The end of history brings the resolution of all contingencies.
    - Middle knowledge is unnecessary when history is viewed from its consummation.
    - "Only in the eschatological consummation will the totality of reality be revealed and known." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s critique of **middle knowledge** and Molinism has influenced contemporary debates on **divine omniscience** and the nature of the future. His insistence on the **historicity of revelation** and the openness of the future has shaped modern discussions of providence and freedom. While not a Molinist, his work remains a significant resource for those seeking to articulate a robust theology of divine knowledge that honors both God’s sovereignty and human agency.
