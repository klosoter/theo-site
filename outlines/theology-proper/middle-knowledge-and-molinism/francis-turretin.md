# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin was a leading Reformed scholastic who rigorously critiqued **Molinism** and its doctrine of **middle knowledge**. He defended the **Reformed doctrine of divine sovereignty** and **predestination**, rejecting the idea that God’s knowledge of future contingents is grounded in the libertarian freedom of creatures. Turretin argued that **middle knowledge** undermines both the certainty of the **divine decree** and the classical understanding of **God’s omniscience**.

- "We deny that there is any such middle knowledge in God, distinct from the natural and free, and that it is necessary to maintain the liberty of the will and contingency of events." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 3.12.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Topics 3.12–3.14)
- The Doctrine of God (sections on divine knowledge and providence)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)
- Francis Turretin: Theologian of the Protestant Scholasticism (secondary: James T. Dennison Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Denial of Middle Knowledge**
    - Argues that **middle knowledge** is a philosophical innovation without biblical warrant.
    - Maintains that God’s knowledge is divided into **natural** (necessary) and **free** (volitional) knowledge only.
    - Asserts that positing a third category undermines the simplicity and unity of God’s knowledge.
    - Insists that all future contingents are known to God because He decrees them, not because He foresees libertarian choices.
    "We do not admit a middle knowledge in God, but only a natural and a free." (Institutes, 3.12.6)

2. **Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty**
    - Upholds that God’s **decree** is the ultimate cause of all things, including contingent events.
    - Rejects any notion that God’s will is conditioned by foreseen human decisions.
    - Emphasizes that God’s sovereignty is incompatible with the Molinist view of libertarian freedom.
    - Argues that **predestination** is grounded solely in God’s will, not in foreseen faith or works.
    "The certainty of the event depends upon the efficacy of the decree, not upon the prescience of God." (Institutes, 3.14.9)

3. **Critique of Libertarian Free Will**
    - Denies that true contingency or responsibility requires the power of contrary choice.
    - Argues that **compatibilist freedom** is sufficient for moral accountability.
    - Claims that Molinism’s libertarian freedom is philosophically incoherent and theologically dangerous.
    - Maintains that human choices are free yet determined within God’s **providence**.
    "The liberty of the will is not destroyed by the necessity of the event." (Institutes, 3.14.13)

4. **Defense of Divine Omniscience**
    - Asserts that God’s knowledge is exhaustive, immediate, and not dependent on creaturely acts.
    - Rejects the idea that God learns or is conditioned by possible creaturely choices.
    - Emphasizes that God knows all possibilities and actualities by virtue of His own **decree**.
    - Maintains that **middle knowledge** implies a passivity in God’s knowledge incompatible with classical theism.
    "God knows future contingents because he has decreed them, not because he foresees them as future." (Institutes, 3.13.7)

5. **Scriptural and Confessional Foundation**
    - Grounds his rejection of **middle knowledge** in the testimony of Scripture and **Reformed confessions**.
    - Argues that the Bible presents God as the author and determiner of history, not a responder to creaturely choices.
    - Appeals to the consensus of the **Reformed tradition** against Molinist innovations.
    - Insists that the doctrine of **providence** and **predestination** are undermined by Molinism.
    "The Reformed churches have always rejected the fiction of middle knowledge." (Institutes, 3.12.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous critique of **Molinism** became a standard reference for later Reformed theologians defending **divine sovereignty** and the classical doctrine of **God’s knowledge**. His arguments shaped confessional responses to Arminianism and influenced the development of Reformed scholasticism. Turretin’s work remains foundational for contemporary debates on **providence**, **predestination**, and the nature of human freedom within the Reformed tradition.
