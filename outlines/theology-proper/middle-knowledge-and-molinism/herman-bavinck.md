# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck critically engaged with **Molinism** and the concept of **middle knowledge** from a distinctly **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the sovereignty of **God’s decree** and the incompatibility of Molinist formulations with **divine omniscience** and **predestination**. He argued that the notion of a contingent knowledge between God’s natural and free knowledge undermines the **absolute sovereignty** and **immutability** of God’s will.

- "Molinism, with its doctrine of middle knowledge, seeks to maintain human freedom at the expense of the sovereignty of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation
- Philosophy of Revelation
- "The Certainty of Faith"
- Herman Bavinck on Preaching and Preachers (for implications on divine sovereignty and human response)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty is Absolute**
   - God’s will is the ultimate cause of all things, including human actions.
   - No external reality or hypothetical human choice can condition or limit God’s decree.
   - Middle knowledge is rejected because it posits a realm of possibility outside God’s sovereign determination.
   - Divine sovereignty is foundational for Bavinck’s understanding of providence and predestination.
   - "God’s counsel is the final and all-embracing cause of everything that comes to pass." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

2. **Rejection of Middle Knowledge**
   - Middle knowledge (scientia media) is seen as a speculative addition without biblical warrant.
   - It introduces a logical moment in God’s knowledge that is neither natural nor free, which Bavinck finds incoherent.
   - Bavinck argues that all possibilities are grounded in God’s will, not in autonomous creaturely choices.
   - The concept undermines the unity and simplicity of God’s knowledge.
   - "There is no room in Reformed theology for a knowledge in God that is determined by the will of the creature." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

3. **Unity of Divine Knowledge**
   - God’s knowledge is simple, eternal, and not divided into temporal or logical stages.
   - All things, actual and possible, are known by God in one eternal act.
   - Bavinck opposes any division of God’s knowledge that would compromise divine simplicity.
   - The Reformed tradition affirms that God’s knowledge and will are inseparable.
   - "God’s knowledge is not successive or composite, but one, simple, and eternal." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

4. **Human Freedom is Real but Subordinate**
   - Human freedom exists within the bounds of God’s sovereign decree.
   - Bavinck affirms compatibilism: human choices are voluntary but not independent of God’s will.
   - Molinism’s libertarian freedom is rejected as incompatible with biblical teaching.
   - True human responsibility is preserved without recourse to middle knowledge.
   - "Freedom in the Reformed sense is not autonomy, but the ability to act according to one’s nature within God’s providence." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

5. **Scriptural Foundation over Philosophical Speculation**
   - Bavinck insists that doctrines must be grounded in Scripture, not speculative philosophy.
   - He critiques Molinism for relying on philosophical categories foreign to biblical revelation.
   - The Reformed doctrine of providence and predestination is rooted in exegesis, not abstract reasoning.
   - The authority of Scripture is paramount in theological formulation.
   - "The Reformed faith seeks its certainty in the Word of God, not in the constructions of human reason." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust critique of **Molinism** and middle knowledge has shaped Reformed responses to issues of **divine sovereignty** and **human freedom**. His insistence on the unity and simplicity of God’s knowledge continues to influence contemporary Reformed dogmatics. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for those defending the coherence of **predestination** and the rejection of speculative theological constructs not grounded in Scripture. His legacy endures in ongoing debates over the relationship between God’s will and human responsibility.
