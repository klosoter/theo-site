# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **God’s attributes** is foundational for later Christian theology, especially in distinguishing between **absolute** (what God is in himself) and **relative** (how God relates to creation) attributes. He insists on the **unity and simplicity of God**, maintaining that all divine attributes are ultimately identical with God’s essence, while also recognizing the necessity of speaking about God in ways that accommodate human understanding.

- "For to God it is not one thing to be, another thing to be just, or mighty, or wise; but to be is to Him the same as to be just, and to be mighty, and to be wise, and generally to be whatever He is." (On the Trinity, V.4.5)

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- Enchiridion
- Letters (Epistulae)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity**
    - God’s essence and attributes are not distinct realities but are identical in God.
    - There is no composition in God; all attributes are one in the divine simplicity.
    - Human language divides attributes for our understanding, not because of real distinctions in God.
    - This undergirds the inseparability of **absolute** and **relative** attributes in God.
    - "God is truly and absolutely simple, and therefore whatever seems to be predicated of Him, is Himself." (De Trinitate, VI.7.8)

2. **Distinction Between Absolute and Relative Attributes**
    - **Absolute attributes** refer to what God is in Himself (e.g., eternity, immutability).
    - **Relative attributes** describe God’s relation to creation (e.g., Creator, Lord).
    - Relative terms do not imply change in God but reflect changes in creatures.
    - This distinction helps safeguard **divine immutability**.
    - "He is called Lord in relation to the creature which serves Him; but in Himself He is God." (De Trinitate, V.16.17)

3. **Analogy and Accommodation in Language about God**
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal.
    - We must use multiple terms to describe God, though He is simple.
    - Scriptural language accommodates human limitations.
    - This approach avoids both agnosticism and anthropomorphism.
    - "We speak of God not as He is, but as we can." (De Civitate Dei, XV.2)

4. **Immutability and Eternity**
    - God’s **absolute attributes** include immutability and eternity.
    - God does not change in Himself, even as He acts in time.
    - Relative attributes do not compromise God’s unchangeableness.
    - God’s eternal being grounds all His actions in history.
    - "God is not changed by those things which are brought to pass by His providence." (Confessions, I.4.4)

5. **Trinitarian Relations as Relative Properties**
    - The **Trinitarian persons** are distinguished by relations, not by essence.
    - These relations (Father, Son, Spirit) are real but do not divide the divine substance.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative is crucial for orthodox Trinitarianism.
    - All three persons share all absolute attributes equally.
    - "The Father is called so not in respect to Himself, but in relation to the Son." (De Trinitate, V.5.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **absolute and relative attributes** of God shaped the entire Western tradition, influencing medieval scholastics and Reformed theologians alike. His insistence on **divine simplicity** and the analogical nature of theological language became standard in classical theism. The Augustinian distinction between what God is in Himself and how He relates to creation remains a touchstone for discussions of **immutability**, **Trinitarian relations**, and the limits of human knowledge of God.
