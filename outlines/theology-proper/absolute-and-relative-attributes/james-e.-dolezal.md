# James E. Dolezal (1979–)

James E. Dolezal is a contemporary Reformed theologian who robustly defends the **classical doctrine of God**, especially the distinction between **absolute and relative attributes**. He insists that God's **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity** require a careful articulation of how God's attributes relate to His being, rejecting any notion that would compromise divine **unchangeability** or introduce composition in God.

- "God is not composed of substance and accidents, nor of essence and existence, nor of act and potency, nor of form and matter, nor of genus and difference, nor of subject and attributes." ("All That Is in God," p. 41)

## Key Works

- All That Is in God: Evangelical Theology and the Challenge of Classical Christian Theism (2017)
- God without Parts: Divine Simplicity and the Metaphysics of God's Absoluteness (2011)
- "Simplicity, Triunity, and the Incomprehensibility of God" in The Lord Is One: Reclaiming Divine Simplicity (2019)
- "Divine Simplicity: A Dogmatic Account" (Westminster Theological Journal, 2016)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Attributes Are Identical with God's Essence**
    - Absolute attributes (e.g., **simplicity**, **aseity**) are not qualities God possesses but are identical with His essence.
    - There is no real distinction between God's essence and His attributes; distinctions are only conceptual.
    - To posit real distinctions would introduce composition and undermine **divine simplicity**.
    - God's absolute attributes are not dependent on creation or any external reality.
    - "God is not composed of parts, whether physical, metaphysical, or conceptual." (All That Is in God, p. 41)

2. **Relative Attributes Express God's Relation to Creation**
    - Relative attributes (e.g., **Creator**, **Redeemer**) describe God's relationship to the world, not changes in His being.
    - These attributes are grounded in God's eternal decree, not in any temporal process or development.
    - Relative attributes do not imply any real change or potentiality in God.
    - The distinction safeguards God's **immutability** and **impassibility**.
    - "Relative attributes are not new realities in God but new ways creatures come to know Him." (All That Is in God, p. 67)

3. **Divine Simplicity as the Foundation**
    - **Divine simplicity** undergirds the distinction between absolute and relative attributes.
    - All that is in God is God; there are no accidents or added properties.
    - Simplicity ensures that God's attributes are not separable or compounded.
    - Any denial of simplicity leads to a mutable and contingent deity.
    - "To deny simplicity is to deny the absolute perfection and ultimacy of God." (God without Parts, p. 100)

4. **Immutability and Aseity Preserved**
    - God is **immutable** and **ase**, meaning He does not change or depend on anything outside Himself.
    - Absolute attributes express this unchangeable, self-existent reality.
    - Relative attributes do not introduce contingency or mutability into God.
    - The distinction upholds the Creator-creature distinction at the metaphysical level.
    - "God’s being is not affected by His works ad extra; He remains eternally the same." (All That Is in God, p. 72)

5. **Conceptual Distinction, Not Real Division**
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is epistemological, not ontological.
    - We distinguish attributes according to our finite understanding, not because of real divisions in God.
    - All attributes ultimately refer to the one, simple divine essence.
    - This approach maintains the mystery and **incomprehensibility** of God.
    - "Our distinctions are true as far as they go, but they do not penetrate the unity of God’s essence." (All That Is in God, p. 44)

## Legacy and Impact

Dolezal has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the **doctrine of God** by recovering and defending the classical distinctions between **absolute and relative attributes**. His work has challenged trends in evangelical and Reformed theology that compromise **divine simplicity** and **immutability**. By articulating a robust metaphysical account of God's attributes, Dolezal has influenced a new generation of theologians to reconsider the foundational commitments of classical theism. His writings continue to serve as a touchstone for debates on the nature of God's being and attributes.
