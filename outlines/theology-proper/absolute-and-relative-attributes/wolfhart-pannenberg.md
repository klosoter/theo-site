# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg reinterpreted the **absolute and relative attributes** of God within his dynamic, historical approach to **doctrine of God**. He rejected static metaphysical categories, instead emphasizing God's **self-revelation** in history and the eschatological unity of God's being. For Pannenberg, the distinction between absolute and relative attributes is meaningful only as it emerges from God's **self-disclosure** in the world and is ultimately resolved in the **eschaton**.

- "God’s being is revealed in his rule over history, not in an abstract, timeless essence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially chapters on doctrine of God)
- Jesus—God and Man
- Revelation as History (with Rolf Rendtorff, et al.)
- Theology and the Kingdom of God
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Attributes Are Historically Manifested**
    - God’s attributes are not abstract qualities but are revealed through **historical acts**.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is secondary to God’s self-revelation.
    - Attributes such as **immutability** and **love** are understood in the context of God’s engagement with creation.
    - The fullness of God’s attributes will be disclosed at the **end of history**.
    - "The being of God is his rule, and this rule is revealed in the history of the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Rejection of Static Metaphysics**
    - Pannenberg critiques classical theism’s reliance on **timelessness** and **impassibility**.
    - He argues that God’s being is not a static substance but a dynamic reality.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is reinterpreted through the lens of **eschatological fulfillment**.
    - God’s attributes are not fixed apart from his acts in history.
    - "God’s essence is not a timeless being but a being that realizes itself in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Eschatological Unity of God’s Attributes**
    - The full meaning of God’s attributes is only revealed **eschatologically**.
    - Absolute and relative attributes are unified in the consummation of God’s kingdom.
    - Present distinctions are provisional, awaiting final clarification in the **eschaton**.
    - God’s self-identity is established in relation to the world’s history.
    - "Only at the end will God’s being be fully manifest as the unity of all his attributes." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Relational Ontology of God**
    - God’s attributes are defined by his relationship to creation.
    - The so-called relative attributes (e.g., mercy, justice) are essential to God’s being.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative is not ontologically fundamental.
    - God’s identity is constituted in relation to the world and humanity.
    - "God is not God without the world; his deity is revealed in his relationship to creation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Revelation as the Basis for Understanding Attributes**
    - Knowledge of God’s attributes is grounded in **revelation**, not speculation.
    - The biblical narrative, especially in Christ, is the primary source for understanding God’s nature.
    - The distinction between attributes arises from the way God reveals himself in salvation history.
    - Theological reflection must be rooted in God’s acts, not abstract qualities.
    - "The attributes of God are to be understood from his acts in history, not from philosophical abstraction." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to the **attributes of God** has significantly influenced modern theology, especially in challenging the classical distinction between **absolute and relative attributes**. His emphasis on **history** and **eschatology** as the context for understanding God’s being has shaped contemporary discussions of divine ontology. By rooting God’s attributes in revelation and relationality, Pannenberg has encouraged a more dynamic and biblically grounded doctrine of God. His work continues to provoke debate on the nature of divine perfection and the relationship between God and the world.
