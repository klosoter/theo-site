# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached the doctrine of **God’s attributes** with a strong emphasis on the **incomprehensibility of God** and the necessity of distinguishing between **absolute** and **relative attributes**. He maintained that while God’s **absolute attributes** (such as **immutability**, **infinity**, and **aseity**) pertain to God’s being in Himself, the **relative attributes** (such as **justice**, **mercy**, and **wisdom**) describe God’s relationship to creation. Kuyper’s Reformed perspective insisted that these distinctions safeguard both the **transcendence** and **immanence** of God.

- "We distinguish between the absolute attributes, which belong to God in Himself, and the relative attributes, which are revealed in relation to His creatures." ("Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology")

- Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology (1898)
- Dictaten Dogmatiek (Dogmatics Lectures, unpublished but influential in his teaching)
- Lectures on Calvinism (1898)
- Principles of Sacred Theology (1898, English translation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Absolute and Relative Attributes**
    - Absolute attributes pertain to God’s essence apart from creation.
    - Relative attributes describe God’s actions and relationships toward the world.
    - This distinction preserves the Creator-creature distinction.
    - It prevents conflating God’s being with His works.
    - "The absolute attributes are those which belong to God as He is in Himself, while the relative are those which come to expression in His relation to the world." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Incomprehensibility of God**
    - God’s essence cannot be fully grasped by human reason.
    - All knowledge of God is analogical, not univocal.
    - The distinction in attributes reflects our limited perspective.
    - Revelation is necessary for any true knowledge of God.
    - "Our knowledge of God is always limited by the boundaries of our creaturely existence." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

3. **Revelation as the Basis for Attribute Distinction**
    - God reveals Himself through both absolute and relative attributes.
    - Scripture is the authoritative source for understanding these distinctions.
    - Human language about God is accommodated to our capacity.
    - The distinction is not arbitrary but grounded in revelation.
    - "It is only by revelation that we can speak of God’s attributes at all." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

4. **Safeguarding Divine Transcendence and Immanence**
    - Absolute attributes emphasize God’s transcendence and otherness.
    - Relative attributes highlight God’s immanence and covenantal engagement.
    - Both are necessary for a balanced doctrine of God.
    - The distinction prevents both deism and pantheism.
    - "God is both infinitely exalted above creation and intimately present within it." (Lectures on Calvinism)

5. **Practical Implications for Worship and Theology**
    - The distinction shapes how believers approach God in worship.
    - It informs the church’s confession and teaching about God.
    - It guards against reducing God to human categories.
    - The distinction fosters humility and reverence before God’s mystery.
    - "The knowledge of God’s attributes must always lead to adoration and awe." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s articulation of the **absolute and relative attributes** has had a lasting influence on Reformed dogmatics, especially in the Dutch Neo-Calvinist tradition. His careful distinction has helped shape subsequent discussions on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the proper limits of theological language. Kuyper’s approach continues to inform contemporary debates on **divine transcendence** and the relationship between God’s being and His works, ensuring that the mystery and majesty of God remain central in Reformed theology.
