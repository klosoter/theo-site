# John Webster (1955–2016)

John Webster approached the distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** within the doctrine of God by emphasizing the primacy of God's **aseity** and **simplicity**. He argued that all divine attributes, whether considered absolute (pertaining to God's inner life) or relative (pertaining to God's relation to creation), must be understood within the context of God's self-revelation and the unity of the divine being.

- "God’s attributes are not qualities added to his being, but are identical with his simple, infinite life." ("God Without Measure, Vol. 1")

## Key Works

- "God Without Measure: Working Papers in Christian Theology, Vol. 1: God and the Works of God"
- "Holiness"
- "Confessing God: Essays in Christian Dogmatics II"
- "The Domain of the Word: Scripture and Theological Reason"
- "Systematic Theology: Volume 1" (editor, with relevant essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity as Foundational**
    - God is not composed of parts; his attributes are identical with his essence.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is an analytical tool, not an ontological division in God.
    - All attributes reflect the one, undivided **divine essence**.
    - Simplicity safeguards the unity and aseity of God against all forms of composition.
    - "The doctrine of simplicity is the grammar of all talk about God’s attributes." ("God Without Measure, Vol. 1")

2. **Aseity and Independence**
    - God’s **aseity** means he is self-existent and dependent on nothing outside himself.
    - Absolute attributes (e.g., eternity, immutability) express God’s independence.
    - Relative attributes (e.g., mercy, justice) are not additions but expressions of the same divine life in relation to creation.
    - The distinction serves to highlight God’s freedom in relating to the world.
    - "Aseity is the principle by which the distinction between God and creatures is maintained." ("God Without Measure, Vol. 1")

3. **Revelation as the Basis for Attribute Distinction**
    - Knowledge of God’s attributes comes through **divine self-revelation**.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes arises from God’s acts in history.
    - Scripture is the normative source for understanding how God’s attributes are disclosed.
    - Theological reflection must be governed by God’s self-presentation, not speculative reason.
    - "The attributes are not discovered by metaphysical speculation but by attending to God’s self-communication." ("Holiness")

4. **Theological Epistemology: Analogia Fidei**
    - Human language about God is analogical, grounded in faith and revelation.
    - The distinction between attributes is a matter of theological reasoning, not direct apprehension.
    - The analogia fidei (analogy of faith) ensures that all attributes are interpreted in light of God’s self-gift in Christ.
    - Theological language must respect the mystery and incomprehensibility of God.
    - "All our speech about God’s attributes is governed by the analogy of faith, not by analogy of being." ("Confessing God")

5. **Attributes and the Economy of Salvation**
    - Relative attributes are most clearly seen in God’s redemptive acts.
    - The **economic Trinity** reveals the relational attributes without compromising the absolute.
    - God’s mercy, justice, and love are expressions of his eternal being as he acts for us in Christ.
    - The unity of attributes is maintained in the outworking of salvation history.
    - "The economy is the theatre in which the fullness of God’s attributes is made manifest." ("God Without Measure, Vol. 1")

## Legacy and Impact

Webster’s robust articulation of **divine simplicity** and his careful handling of the absolute-relative attribute distinction have significantly influenced contemporary Reformed and ecumenical theology. His insistence on grounding all theological reflection in **revelation** and the unity of God’s being has shaped discussions on the doctrine of God, especially regarding the relationship between God’s inner life and his works in the world. Webster’s work continues to guide theologians in maintaining the transcendence and immanence of God without collapsing the distinction between Creator and creature.
