### ESSAY
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
The distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** attempts to map our God-talk across two axes: how God is in himself and how God is toward creatures. Absolute attributes refer to perfections conceived without reference to anything other than God himself, such as **aseity**, **simplicity**, and **immutability**; relative attributes designate perfections as they are conceived in relation to another, either within God, as in **paternity and filiation**, or *ad extra*, as in creator, lord, and judge. Because classical theism insists on **divine simplicity** the distinction is not a division in God but a distinction in our mode of predication. The locus is Theology Proper, where predicate discipline protects the unity of God while allowing rich confessional naming that undergirds **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **soteriology**.

Within this locus several taxonomies overlap: **incommunicable versus communicable perfections**; **negative versus positive names**; and **absolute versus relative names**. While the lists interlace, they are not identical. Immutability is often called an **absolute and incommunicable perfection**, mercy a **relative and communicable perfection**. Yet under **divine simplicity** each attribute is identical with the one essence. The scholastic rule is that distinctions among attributes are **virtual distinctions** on the side of our concepts, not real divisions on the side of God, a conviction that constrains any use of **relative attributes** to avoid positing composition in the divine.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
Scripture yields both absolute and relational predications of God, anchoring the grammar of **absolute and relative attributes**. The divine name in Exodus 3:14, *ehyeh asher ehyeh* rendered I AM WHO I AM, grounds **aseity** and **immutability** by naming God as self-existent and faithful. Texts such as Psalm 102:26–27, Malachi 3:6, and James 1:17 assert **unchangeableness**, while Isaiah 40 and Acts 17:24–25 proclaim **infinity** and **independence**. The Sovereign Lord dwells beyond temple and creature need, disclosing **simplicity** by insisting that God is not composed of parts that could be served or supplemented by creation.

At the same time, Scripture freely predicates relational and effectual names. Exodus 34:6–7 catalogues **mercy and justice** as covenantal acts toward Israel, giving the pattern for **relative attributes** such as forgiving iniquity and punishing guilt. The New Testament intensifies relational predication: 1 Corinthians 8:6 names one God the Father and one Lord Jesus Christ, emphasizing **paternity and lordship**; John 5:26 and John 17:1–5 speak of **eternal generation** and the Father-Son relation *ad intra*, while Romans 3:25–26 describes God as **just and the justifier** *ad extra*. The biblical pattern requires that **absolute perfections** ground **relative perfections** so that mercy and wrath, love and justice, are not competitive traits but one simple God's manifold ways with creatures.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
Patristic theology sharpened the grammar through **relative names** in Trinitarian dogma. **Augustine** in De Trinitate (399–419) argued that names like Father and Son are **relative attributes** because they are said in relation to another within the Godhead, while names like good and great are **absolute attributes** said of the one essence. He insisted that relative predications do not introduce change in God but only denote eternal relations, thereby safeguarding **divine simplicity** and **immutability**. The Nicene confession of *homoousios* in 325 and 381 required that relative processions be distinguished without dividing the one **simple essence**.

Medieval scholastics clarified predication under **analogy of being**. **Thomas Aquinas** in ST I.13 narrates how we name God both **absolutely and relatively**, with analogical predication protecting against univocity and equivocity. For Aquinas, all perfections are really identical with **the divine essence**, and distinctions flow from our finite intellect. **Duns Scotus** proposed a **formal distinction a parte rei** among divine attributes, seeking to explain real foundation for non-trivial predications without composition. The **Fourth Lateran Council (1215)** insisted that however many names we ascribe to God, God is greater than our concepts, establishing a conciliar warrant for analogical and humble use of **absolute and relative attributes**.

Eastern tradition contributed an alternate grammar: **Gregory Palamas** (councils 1341–1351) distinguished between the divine **essence and energies** to account for how God is both transcendent and communicative. While not mapping exactly onto absolute and relative, the **essence-energies distinction** functioned to safeguard **divine simplicity** as transcendence while explaining relational operations as uncreated energies. Western scholastics generally did not adopt this scheme, but both streams aimed to confess that God toward us is the same God as God in himself.

The Reformation did not discard this grammar but refined it within **confessional theology**. **Calvin** stressed **divine accommodation** and retained **absolute perfections** like **aseity** and **immutability**, while insisting on **Calvins autotheos** in articulating the Son's deity to avoid subordinating the Son in essence even while preserving the **relative name** of eternal generation. Post-Reformation **Reformed scholastics** such as **Amandus Polanus** (Syntagma 1609), **Francis Turretin** (Institutes 1679–1685), and **Petrus van Mastricht** (1699) classified attributes under **incommunicable/communicable** and **absolute/relative** to structure dogmatics with a strong conception of **simplicity** and **aseity**.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
The **Westminster Confession (1646)**, chapter 2, names God as without body, parts, or passions, infinite, eternal, unchangeable, which encodes **absolute attributes** under **divine simplicity** and **immutability**. It also names God as most just, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, articulating **relative attributes** in covenant relation. The confession's coherence lies in the assumption that the one act of God, simple and eternal, is variously applied in time, thus coordinating **absolute and relative perfections**.

**Old Princeton** theologians such as **Charles Hodge** (Systematic Theology 1871–1873) and **B. B. Warfield** employed a realist metaphysic of **divine perfections** yet hewed closely to analogical predication. Hodge distinguishes **absolute attributes** like independence and immutability from **relative attributes** such as justice and mercy, while insisting that all are identical in God under **divine simplicity**. **Dutch Neo-Calvinists** like **Herman Bavinck** (Reformed Dogmatics 1895–1901) integrated organismic motifs, arguing that the perfections are many only in our conception, one in **God's simple essence**; he interweaves **incommunicable and communicable attributes** with **absolute and relative names** to show that God is full, living, and personal, whose **immutability** is the firmness of faithful love, not inertness.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
**Roman Catholic Thomism** largely retains **absolute and relative names** within the analogical framework, emphasizing **actus purus** and **simplicity**. Twentieth-century ressourcement, from **Garrigou-Lagrange** to **Thomas Weinandy**, interprets **impassibility** and **immutability** as the plenitude of perfect act, not defect of love, and understands **relative attributes** like mercy as terminative of one simple divine action upon changing creatures. The Thomist insistence that God's knowledge and will are identical with his being undergirds a stable account of **absolute perfections** that underwrite **relative operations**.

**Lutheran** theology emphasizes **Deus absconditus and Deus revelatus** in **Martin Luther** and the orthodox dogmaticians like **Martin Chemnitz** and **Johann Gerhard**. While confessing **simplicity** and **immutability**, they accent the dialectic of hiddenness and revelation: **relative attributes** in the gospel, such as mercy, are God's definitive self-presentation of the same God who is incomprehensible. The **communication of attributes** in Christology as developed by the Formula of Concord (1577) intensifies attention to how **absolute perfections** relate to the incarnate life, while guarding against collapsing **divine impassibility** into creaturely suffering outside the hypostatic union.

Modern revisions range widely. **Karl Barth** in Church Dogmatics II/1 (1936) reconceives the divine perfections as **love and freedom** in act, reinterpreting **immutability** as the **immutability of faithful love** and **impassibility** as the **impassibility of sovereign compassion**. He resists a static catalog of **absolute attributes**, making all divine perfections relational in God's decision in Jesus Christ, though he affirms a robust **divine lordship** that binds God's being and act. In contrast, **Process** and **Open Theism** movements, from **Alfred North Whitehead** and **Charles Hartshorne** to **Clark Pinnock** and **Greg Boyd**, deny classical **immutability and impassibility**, pressing maximal **relative attributes** by positing real change and temporal succession in God, thereby rejecting **divine simplicity** as metaphysical baggage.

In **analytic theology**, the debate centers on **divine simplicity** and how many attributes God can have without parts. Critics like **Alvin Plantinga** and **R. T. Mullins** argue that classical simplicity makes attributes indistinguishable and undermines personal agency, while defenders such as **Brian Leftow**, **Jeffrey Brower**, and **James Dolezal** articulate models where attributes are **really identical** yet **conceptually distinct**, or where God is identical to his existence without collapsing predications into vacuity. Analytic treatments often distinguish **intrinsic (absolute) properties** and **extrinsic (relative) properties**, seeking a metaphysic where extrinsic relational truths about God do not entail **change in God**, thus preserving **immutability** and providential freedom.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
A first objection claims that if mercy and justice are **relative attributes** they might be secondary or accidental, rendering the gospel contingent and fragile. The classical reply draws on **divine simplicity**: mercy and justice are not accidental but identical with the one divine essence, differentiated by their temporal termini. Thus at the cross, God is eternally himself, manifesting **justice and mercy** in one unitive act, a claim defended by **Reformed scholastics** and renewed by **Bavinck** and **Dolezal**.

A second debate targets whether **immutability and impassibility** can sustain robust relationality. Critics argue that covenant involvement and suffering love require change. Classical theists reinterpret predication through **analogy and accommodation**: Scripture's language of repentance or grief is **anthropopathic** language of God's stable opposition to sin as it meets changing creatures. Contemporary proposals of **qualified passibility** and **immutable compassion** attempt to synthesize concerns, aligning with **Barth's constancy of love** while retaining the heart of **simplicity**. A third debate involves **Scotist formal distinction** versus purely conceptual distinction: whether acknowledging a formal distinction among perfections best accounts for Scripture's plurality of divine names without violating unity, a live question in **analytic metaphysics**.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
The distinction bears on **Trinitarian doctrine** because **relative names** within God denote eternal relations of origin, not temporal operations. **Paternity, filiation, and spiration** are intrinsic relative predications that neither add parts nor imply change, showing how **absolute simplicity** houses real relationality in God. In **Christology**, the one person of Christ manifests **relative divine operations** in time while remaining the eternal Son; the **communication of idioms** relies on the integrity of **divine immutability** in the incarnation. In **Anthropology**, the image of God frames **communicable attributes** such as wisdom and righteousness as creaturely participations, tied to **relative attributes** by covenant. In **Soteriology**, justification and adoption express **mercy and justice** as relative acts grounded in **absolute holiness**. In **Eschatology**, the **beatific vision** is participation in the **simple glory** of God, the consummation of all **relative perfections** in our perfected relation to God.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastorally, teaching **absolute attributes** stabilizes assurance: the God who is **immutable and faithful** keeps covenant, making promises sure despite creaturely flux. Preaching **relative attributes** such as mercy, patience, and wrath names God's actual ways with us, inviting repentance and hope. Liturgically, the church's doxology addresses the **one simple Lord** with many excellent names, allowing hymns to praise **aseity** and **love** without confusion. Catechesis can explain **analogy and accommodation** so believers grasp why Scripture alternately says God does not repent and that God repented, preserving the coherence of **simplicity** while honoring **relational language**. In prayer and mission, trusting **absolute perfections** emboldens perseverance, while naming **relative perfections** contextualizes God's steadfast grace to sinners.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
Rightly distinguishing yet uniting **absolute and relative attributes** teaches the church to confess the one **simple and faithful God** who is eternally himself and unfailingly for us.
