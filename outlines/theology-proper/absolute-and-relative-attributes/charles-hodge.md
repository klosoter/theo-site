# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, distinguished between the **absolute** and **relative attributes** of God as part of his broader doctrine of the **divine perfections**. He maintained that the **absolute attributes** (such as simplicity, infinity, and immutability) describe God's essential being, while the **relative attributes** (such as omnipotence, omniscience, and sovereignty) pertain to God's relationship with creation. Hodge insisted that both sets of attributes are fully revealed in Scripture and are essential for a proper understanding of the **doctrine of God**.

- "The attributes of God are not so many separate parts or faculties; they are the different modes in which the divine essence exists." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Absolute and Relative Attributes**
    - Absolute attributes pertain to God's essence, independent of creation.
    - Relative attributes describe God's actions or relations toward the world.
    - This distinction helps clarify the unity and diversity within the divine perfections.
    - Both categories are revealed and affirmed in Scripture.
    - "Theologians have been accustomed to distinguish the attributes of God as absolute and relative." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Unity of the Divine Essence**
    - God's attributes are not separable parts but modes of the one divine essence.
    - The distinction is logical, not ontological; God is simple, not composite.
    - All attributes are fully possessed by the one, indivisible God.
    - This guards against tritheism and upholds divine simplicity.
    - "The divine attributes are not to be regarded as so many distinct powers or qualities." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Scriptural Foundation for Attributes**
    - Both absolute and relative attributes are derived from biblical revelation.
    - Hodge rejects speculative philosophy as the primary source for theology.
    - The names and perfections of God must be grounded in Scripture.
    - This commitment ensures doctrinal fidelity and confessional orthodoxy.
    - "All our knowledge of God is derived from his self-revelation in the Scriptures." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Immutability and Infinity as Absolute Attributes**
    - Immutability and infinity are central to God's absolute attributes.
    - These perfections underscore God's transcendence and independence.
    - They provide the foundation for trust in God's promises and character.
    - Hodge links these attributes to the assurance of salvation and providence.
    - "God is infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in his being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Relative Attributes and Divine Economy**
    - Relative attributes express God's relationship to creation (e.g., omnipotence, omniscience).
    - These attributes are manifested in God's works of creation, providence, and redemption.
    - Hodge emphasizes that these do not imply change in God but in his works ad extra.
    - The distinction aids in understanding God's immanence without compromising his transcendence.
    - "The relative attributes are those which imply relation to the world, as Creator, Preserver, and Governor." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s careful articulation of the **absolute and relative attributes** became foundational for later Reformed and evangelical theology, especially in the American context. His insistence on the unity of the divine essence and the scriptural basis for all theological distinctions shaped generations of theologians at Princeton and beyond. The clarity and precision of his distinctions continue to inform contemporary discussions on the **doctrine of God** and serve as a bulwark against both rationalistic speculation and theological reductionism.
