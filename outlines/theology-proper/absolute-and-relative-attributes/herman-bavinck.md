# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck carefully distinguished between the **absolute** and **relative attributes** of God, emphasizing that all divine attributes are ultimately unified in God's simple essence. He argued that while **absolute attributes** (such as **aseity** and **immutability**) pertain to God's being in Himself, and **relative attributes** (such as **omnipresence** and **omniscience**) describe God's relation to creation, these distinctions are analytical and not real divisions within God. Bavinck maintained that every attribute reveals the fullness of the one, living God, and that human language about God is always analogical.

- "All the attributes are identical with God's being; they are not qualities that are in God, but are identical with his essence." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.107)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Divine Essence**
    - God’s attributes are not parts or additions to His essence but are identical with His being.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is a human, not ontological, distinction.
    - Divine simplicity means all attributes are fully present in every act of God.
    - The unity of God’s essence safeguards against dividing God into composite parts.
    - "In God, too, all his attributes are identical with his essence." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.107)

2. **Absolute Attributes Defined**
    - Absolute attributes refer to what God is in Himself, apart from creation.
    - Examples include **aseity**, **immutability**, **infinity**, and **simplicity**.
    - These attributes highlight God’s transcendence and self-sufficiency.
    - They are foundational for understanding God’s independence from the world.
    - "The so-called absolute attributes are those which belong to God alone and are not communicable to creatures." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.107)

3. **Relative Attributes Defined**
    - Relative attributes describe God’s relationship to creation.
    - Examples include **omnipresence**, **omniscience**, and **omnipotence**.
    - These attributes express how God relates to and sustains the world.
    - They do not imply change or dependence in God but reveal His immanence.
    - "Relative attributes are those which, though they have their ground in the divine being, come to expression in relation to the world." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.108)

4. **Analogical Knowledge of God**
    - Human language about God’s attributes is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - We know God truly but not exhaustively; our distinctions are limited by creaturely understanding.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is a tool for finite comprehension.
    - All attributes ultimately point back to the one, simple essence of God.
    - "We know God only in part, and all our knowledge of him is analogical." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.110)

5. **Rejection of Real Division in God**
    - Bavinck rejects any real division or composition in God’s being.
    - The distinction between attributes is epistemological, not ontological.
    - God’s simplicity means He is not a sum of attributes but wholly and perfectly each one.
    - This commitment guards the doctrine of **divine simplicity** and the unity of God.
    - "There are not many attributes in God, but one single, infinite fullness of life." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.107)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced articulation of the **absolute and relative attributes** has shaped modern Reformed theology’s approach to the doctrine of God. His insistence on **divine simplicity** and the analogical nature of theological language continues to influence contemporary discussions on the knowability of God. Bavinck’s careful balance between God’s transcendence and immanence provides a robust framework for systematic theology, ensuring that distinctions serve to clarify rather than divide the unity of God’s essence.
