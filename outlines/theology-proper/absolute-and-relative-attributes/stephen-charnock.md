# Stephen Charnock (1628–1680)

Stephen Charnock, a Puritan divine, offered a classic exposition of the **attributes of God**, distinguishing between **absolute attributes** (those belonging to God in Himself) and **relative attributes** (those manifest in relation to creation). He emphasized that while God's **essence** is singular and indivisible, His attributes are perceived differently according to their relation to the world, yet all are perfectly unified in the divine nature.

- "The attributes of God are not distinct from his essence, but only our conceptions of them are distinct." ("The Existence and Attributes of God")

## Key Works

- The Existence and Attributes of God (Volumes 1 & 2)
- "A Discourse on the Existence of God"
- "A Discourse on the Eternity of God"
- "A Discourse on the Omnipresence of God"
- "A Discourse on God's Knowledge"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Absolute and Relative Attributes**
    - Absolute attributes pertain to God's being as He is in Himself (e.g., **eternity**, **immutability**).
    - Relative attributes describe God in relation to His creation (e.g., **justice**, **mercy**).
    - This distinction aids human understanding but does not divide God's essence.
    - Both sets of attributes are fully and perfectly present in God at all times.
    - "Some attributes are absolute, as holiness, power; some are relative, as creator, governor." (The Existence and Attributes of God)

2. **Unity and Simplicity of God’s Essence**
    - God's attributes are not parts or qualities added to His essence.
    - The divine **simplicity** means all attributes are identical with God's essence.
    - Distinctions arise from human limitation, not from God Himself.
    - The unity of attributes safeguards against dividing the Godhead.
    - "All the attributes are the same with the essence, and the essence the same with the attributes." (The Existence and Attributes of God)

3. **Incomprehensibility and Accommodation**
    - Human language and categories are inadequate to fully grasp God's being.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is a tool for finite minds.
    - God accommodates His revelation to human capacity.
    - The incomprehensibility of God calls for humility in theological reflection.
    - "We cannot comprehend what God is, but we may comprehend what he is not." (The Existence and Attributes of God)

4. **Necessity of Both Sets of Attributes for True Knowledge of God**
    - Absolute attributes reveal God’s transcendence and majesty.
    - Relative attributes reveal God’s immanence and dealings with creation.
    - Both are necessary for a balanced and biblical doctrine of God.
    - Neglecting either set leads to distortion of the divine character.
    - "We must conceive of God as he hath revealed himself, both in his absolute and relative perfections." (The Existence and Attributes of God)

5. **Practical Implications for Worship and Piety**
    - Meditation on God’s attributes leads to reverence and awe.
    - Understanding both absolute and relative attributes grounds assurance and trust.
    - The distinction shapes prayer, adoration, and ethical living.
    - True worship arises from a right apprehension of who God is in Himself and toward us.
    - "The more we know of his nature and attributes, the more fit we are to honor him as he ought to be honored." (The Existence and Attributes of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Charnock’s careful articulation of the **absolute and relative attributes** has profoundly influenced Reformed and Puritan theology, shaping subsequent discussions of the **doctrine of God**. His insistence on the unity and simplicity of God’s essence, while maintaining the practical value of distinguishing attributes, remains a standard reference in systematic theology. Charnock’s work continues to be valued for its depth, clarity, and devotional warmth, serving as a bridge between scholastic precision and pastoral application.
