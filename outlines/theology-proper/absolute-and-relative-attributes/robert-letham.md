# Robert Letham (1947– )

Robert Letham approaches the distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** with caution, emphasizing the unity and simplicity of the **divine essence**. He critiques overly rigid distinctions that risk fragmenting God’s being, instead advocating for a **Trinitarian** and **classically Reformed** understanding in which all attributes are fully possessed by each divine person and are not separable in God himself.

- "God’s attributes are not parts of God, nor are they separable from his being; they are identical with his essence." (Systematic Theology, 2020)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2020)
- The Holy Trinity: In Scripture, History, Theology, and Worship (2019)
- The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context (2009)
- "Classical Theism, Reformed Orthodoxy, and the Attributes of God" (in The Westminster Theological Journal, 2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity Maintained**
   - Affirms that all **attributes** are identical with the divine essence.
   - Warns against dividing God’s being through absolute-relative distinctions.
   - Attributes such as **immutability** and **eternity** are not separable from God’s relational actions.
   - Upholds the classical doctrine as articulated in the **Westminster Confession**.
   - "To divide God’s attributes into absolute and relative is to risk undermining the doctrine of divine simplicity." (Systematic Theology, 2020)

2. **Trinitarian Context for Attributes**
   - Attributes are fully possessed by each **person of the Trinity**.
   - The distinction must not compromise the unity of the Godhead.
   - Trinitarian relations are not additional attributes but internal to God’s being.
   - The economic and immanent Trinity are inseparable in understanding attributes.
   - "The attributes of God are not distributed among the persons but are held in common." (The Holy Trinity, 2019)

3. **Cautions Against Over-Philosophizing**
   - Critiques speculative distinctions not grounded in **biblical revelation**.
   - Emphasizes the limits of human language about God.
   - Attributes must be understood analogically, not univocally.
   - The absolute-relative distinction can obscure the biblical witness to God’s character.
   - "We must beware of imposing philosophical categories on the biblical doctrine of God." (Systematic Theology, 2020)

4. **Attributes Revealed in Redemptive History**
   - God’s so-called relative attributes (e.g., mercy, justice) are revealed in his works.
   - These are not additions to God’s essence but expressions of who he is.
   - The distinction is descriptive of revelation, not of God’s inner being.
   - The **covenantal** context is crucial for understanding how God’s attributes are known.
   - "God’s attributes are revealed in his actions in history, but they are eternally true of him." (Systematic Theology, 2020)

5. **Continuity with Reformed Orthodoxy**
   - Follows the trajectory of **Reformed scholasticism** while updating its categories.
   - Sees value in the distinction as a pedagogical tool, not as an ontological separation.
   - Emphasizes the confessional heritage of the **Westminster Standards**.
   - Seeks to integrate classical theism with contemporary concerns.
   - "The Reformed tradition has always insisted that God’s attributes are not parts, but ways of describing his one, simple being." (Systematic Theology, 2020)

## Legacy and Impact

Letham’s work has reinforced a **Reformed, Trinitarian** approach to the doctrine of God, especially regarding the discussion of **divine attributes**. His careful critique of the absolute-relative distinction has influenced contemporary systematic theology to avoid fragmenting God’s essence. Letham’s writings continue to shape confessional and academic conversations, ensuring that classical doctrines are articulated with clarity and fidelity to both Scripture and the Reformed tradition.
