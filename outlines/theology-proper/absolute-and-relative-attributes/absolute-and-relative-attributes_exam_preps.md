### TITLE
Naming the Simple God: Absolute and Relative Attributes in Classical Theism

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: how to affirm real, diverse divine perfections and genuine relations to creatures while upholding **divine simplicity** and **immutability**, without collapsing God into either an undifferentiated essence or a bundle of changing relations.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Francis Turretin, Herman Bavinck.
- Relevant traditions: Latin patristic trinitarianism and attributes; high medieval scholasticism; Reformed scholasticism; neo-Calvinist dogmatics engaging modern personalism and process thought.
- Debates:
  - Internal: real vs rational distinction of attributes; the status of **relative attributes** and God’s knowledge and will ad extra; Reformed refinements and critiques of Thomist language.
  - External: nominalism and univocity; modern personal theism, panentheism, and process theology rejecting simplicity and pure actuality; analytic relational theism.
  - Contemporary: divine passibility and relational mutability; biblical-theological emphasis on God’s history with his people; analytic models of God’s temporal or changing relational properties.
- Defended position: absolute and relative attributes are distinct on the level of our **analogical knowledge**, but in God they are identical with the one simple essence, and even the so‑called relative attributes signify no real change in God but only new relations of reason founded on God’s eternal decree and the temporal existence of creatures.

### ESSAY
To speak of absolute and relative attributes is to ask how the one simple God can be both fully determined in himself and yet truly related to creatures without undergoing any real change. The core claim of classical theism is that God is actus purus, pure, uncomposed actuality, whose **absolute attributes** such as **immutability**, **eternity**, **simplicity**, **omniscience**, and **omnipotence** are simply the divine essence under different conceptual aspects. At the same time, Scripture describes God as knowing, willing, loving, electing, forgiving, and judging specific creatures in time. These are often called **relative attributes**, because they name God insofar as he stands in relation to something other than himself. The theological tension is immediate: if God is absolutely simple and immutable, how can relative attributes be anything more than human projections? Yet if we make them real changes in God, we undercut divine aseity and the Creator–creature distinction. The topic forces the candidate to integrate a doctrine of God’s inner perfection with a doctrine of God’s outward works and relations.

Augustine is decisive because he laid the conceptual grammar that the Latin West would assume. In De Trinitate and De civitate Dei he insists that all perfections in God are identical with God and with one another. When we say that God is good, wise, powerful, or just, we are not predicating different qualities of a subject, but naming the one simple divine being under multiple aspects. Augustine’s method arises from his contemplative reading of Scripture through a Platonizing metaphysic: God is the immutable, eternal source of all being and goodness, to whom all change and multiplicity belong only as effects, not as intrinsic features. So for Augustine, God’s so‑called attributes are just the divine essence considered in different ways. He moves from this to the question of relations. Scripture describes the Father as Lord of Israel, Creator of heaven and earth, Judge of all. Are these real relational additions in God? Augustine famously articulates what later scholastics will refine: relations that arise only with the creature are not real changes in God but belong to creatures; they are “according to time” with respect to us, not with respect to God’s own being.

An examiner might object that Augustine has simply declared by fiat that these relations are unreal in God, thereby endangering divine personalism. However, Augustine anchors this account in his doctrine of **eternity** and **causality**. God’s eternal will is the cause of temporal effects; thus, when Israel comes into covenant with God, the novelty lies wholly on Israel’s side, not God’s. God’s knowledge and will do not move from not‑knowing to knowing or from not‑willing to willing. Rather, the effect begins to exist, and with it a new relation that is real in the creature and denominates the creature as now “in covenant” or “justified,” while God remains the same eternal covenanting and justifying God. Hence, in Augustine we see an early, robust deployment of what later theology will express by saying that **relative attributes** signify relations of reason in God that are founded on real temporal effects in creatures.

Thomas Aquinas develops this Augustinian inheritance with unparalleled precision and is the central architect for the later Western distinction of absolute and relative attributes. In the Summa Theologiae and Summa contra Gentiles, Aquinas argues from God’s pure actuality and **simplicity** that there can be no composition in God of essence and existence, form and matter, or subject and accidents. This has immediate implications for attributes. If God had really distinct attributes, they would function as accidents inhering in a subject; this would compromise his aseity and independence. Therefore, Aquinas famously holds that in God essence is existence, and that God’s wisdom, power, goodness, and will are all really identical with one another and with the divine being. The multiplicity of names arises from our finite, discursive **analogical knowledge** of that one simple perfection.

At this point, examiners will press: if all attributes are identical in God, are you not left with an empty abstraction that contradicts the richly differentiated God of Scripture? This is where Aquinas’s account of analogy and the distinction between absolute and relative names is indispensable. For Aquinas, an **absolute attribute** names what belongs to God without regard to anything outside himself: being, life, wisdom, justice, power. We derive these by considering God as the source of them in creatures and then removing the marks of finitude and composition. A **relative attribute** names God as ordered to another: Lord, Creator, Redeemer, King, Judge. These do not introduce composition into God because the relation is not a change or quality inhering in God, but a way we conceive God in terms of his effects. Aquinas argues in De potentia and the Summa that in God there can be real relations only within the Trinity, since there the correlative terms are within the divine essence itself. All relations to creatures are not real relations in God but relations of reason, though not arbitrary ones. They are grounded in his eternal decree and knowledge of creatures, which themselves are identical with his essence.

The crucial move is the order of explanation: God’s will to create this world rather than another is an eternal, simple act. Nothing in God changes when the world begins. Yet because that one eternal will is the cause of effects that come to be, we can now truly denominate God as Creator, Lord of Israel, or Incarnate in time. The relation is real in the creature, so that the world is really dependent on God, but the corresponding relation in God is conceptual. This does not trivialize the language. It safeguards the fundamental asymmetry of Creator and creature. Aquinas can therefore insist that the names “Creator” or “Lord” are true of God and meaningful, yet they introduce no composition or mutability in him. In scholastic terms, we say that relations to creatures are extrinsic denominations of God.

Duns Scotus represents both an internal development of this tradition and a pressure point against it. The Subtle Doctor is often cast simplistically as the man who broke the back of **divine simplicity** with his insistence on the univocity of being and his use of the formal distinction. The reality is more complex. Scotus firmly affirms a robust doctrine of divine unity and simplicity. He does not think God is composed of parts. But he does believe that the Thomist appeal to purely rational distinctions risks making the divine attributes merely subjective constructions. If wisdom and power are only differently conceived aspects of the same reality, is there any ground in God himself for this difference? Scotus thus introduces the idea of a formal distinction in God. The formalities of wisdom and goodness are not really distinct entities, but they are not merely conceptual either; they are distinct aspects in re that ground the variety of names. This move attempts to protect the objective basis of the multiplicity of perfections without positing real composition.

With respect to absolute and relative attributes, Scotus pushes in two directions that will reverberate into later debates. First, his univocal account of being makes it easier to speak of God as possessing properties analogously to creatures, even if in an infinite mode. This can soften the sharp Thomist insistence on analogy and encourage thinking of attributes as more like a set of infinite properties in God. Second, his subtler distinctions in God open conceptual room for more talk of intrinsic relationality without feeling that one has reified accidents in God. Some contemporary relational theists lean on Scotist ideas, arguing that God can have non‑accidental, intrinsically relational dispositions or orientations without thereby becoming composed. Examiners will expect you to see the tension: Scotus wants to maintain simplicity, but his tools can be and have been deployed to dismantle it.

The Reformed scholastic Francis Turretin appropriates much of the Thomist–Augustinian inheritance, yet he reformulates it within **federal theology** and a rigorous commitment to sola Scriptura. In the Institutio theologiae elencticae, Turretin insists on the **absolute attributes** of God such as simplicity, independence, eternity, and immutability, and he firmly rejects any real composition in God. For Turretin, God’s essence is his existence, and all attributes are really identical with that essence. At the same time, he takes great care to preserve the reality and efficacy of God’s free decree and covenant dealings. Within his high scholastic Reformed framework, the distinction of absolute and relative attributes becomes crucial for integrating an immutable God with contingent covenants.

Turretin distinguishes attributes that denote God considered in himself, such as infinity or simplicity, from those that denote him in relation to creatures, such as Creator, Lord of hosts, or Father of lights. He echoes Aquinas in saying that these relations are not real accidents in God but arise from the temporal existence of creatures. Yet Turretin embeds this within the structure of the covenants of works and grace. God’s being the God of Abraham is a relative name, grounded in the eternal decree of election and in the temporal establishment of the Abrahamic covenant. Nothing new appears in God; rather, new states of affairs arise in history that license new true predicates of God from our side. The Reformed confessions’ language about God’s “most absolute” and “most free” will pivots on this conceptualization.

An internal Reformed debate surfaces here. Some later Reformed theologians, worried about the scholastic language of “mere” relations of reason, accuse it of rendering God’s covenant involvement thin and unreal. Are we not saying that God is not really covenant Lord, but only appears to be so from our limited vantage? Turretin himself disarms this objection by insisting that these are relations of reason in God, but they are founded in real, efficacious divine acts and effects. The decree is not a mere label; it is God’s own willing of the covenant order. Because that willing is identical with God’s essence, to say “God is covenant Lord” is to say something about who God eternally is, not merely about what we think of him. The whole ordering of the decrees and the doctrine of **pure act** supports this.

Herman Bavinck represents a later Reformed dogmatician who wrestles intensely with the pressure of modernity on these categories. In Reformed Dogmatics Bavinck strongly affirms **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and the classical view of attributes, explicitly following Augustine, Aquinas, and Turretin. He defends the notion that all God’s attributes are one in him and that there is no composition of subject and properties. Yet Bavinck is also acutely aware of the biblical and experiential emphasis on God’s living, dynamic history with his people, and of the modern personalist criticism that the God of metaphysics is an impersonal absolute.

Bavinck therefore refines the distinction of absolute and relative attributes in a more explicitly trinitarian and christological direction. He argues that the distinction is fundamentally a distinction in our mode of cognition: the **absolute attributes** express God as he is in himself, while **relative attributes** express “the same God” as he relates to the world he freely created. There is no opposition between them. He rejects any suggestion that the absolute attributes are more “real” or “essential” than the relative. For Bavinck, all attributes are essential, but the relative ones presuppose the free decree to create and redeem. He writes that God is “in himself” the God of grace and mercy, not first a bare absolute who later acquires covenantal dispositions. This moves beyond some earlier scholastic formulations where the decree could seem add‑on; Bavinck insists that God’s will to reveal himself graciously is eternally rooted in who God is as triune love.

At this point, an examiner may probe the contemporary debates. Modern relational theists, open theists, and process theologians reject the traditional doctrine at precisely this juncture. They argue that if God’s relative attributes are only relations of reason, then God does not really respond, grieve, or rejoice, contrary to Scripture’s pervasive witness. Some in analytic philosophy of religion add that God must acquire new relational properties as time passes. When Abraham begins to exist, surely God comes to have the property of “being the creator of Abraham,” which he did not have before. If God acquires new properties, is that not a real change? If we deny it, are we not playing semantic games?

The classical response, which I defend, turns on a careful deployment of **analogical knowledge**, the Creator–creature distinction, and the asymmetry between intrinsic and extrinsic denominations. We must distinguish between God’s intrinsic perfections and the extrinsic ways we are warranted to speak of him in light of new creaturely realities. On the classical account, God’s eternal knowledge and will already encompass all possible and actual creatures. There is no increase in information on God’s side. The beginning of Abraham adds nothing to God; it only adds Abraham and his dependence. Nevertheless, once Abraham exists, the predicate “is Creator of Abraham” becomes truly applicable to God. The novelty lies in the predicate’s truth‑value, grounded in Abraham’s existence and dependence, not in any new state of God. The property “being Creator of Abraham” is an extrinsic denomination, not an intrinsic property of God. It is similar to the way in which a rock does not change intrinsically when I begin to think about it, even though it becomes true that the rock is “thought of by me.”

Does this destroy genuine divine relationality and love? No, because God’s love, knowledge, and will are not passive receptions of creaturely impacts, but active perfections identical with his essence. Scripture’s language of God’s “repenting” or being “grieved” functions, on this reading, as anthropomorphic and anthropopathic accommodation that reveals true aspects of God’s holy character in ways proportioned to our finite understanding. Bavinck here is especially valuable as he stresses that anthropomorphisms are not false images but analogical ones; they are grounded in real correspondences between God’s perfections and our creaturely experience, even if they do not map one‑to‑one. To say God is grieved at sin is to say that in his holy, immutable opposition to evil there is that which answers to our purified notion of grief, without imputing to God the passibility and involuntary suffering that creaturely grief involves.

The contemporary challenge from passibilism and open theism centers on whether such a reading really squares with the biblical drama. Open theists argue that God’s knowledge of future free acts is open and that God genuinely discovers what creatures will do as history unfolds; this appears to make God’s relative attributes real temporal states. Process thinkers say more radically that God is essentially related to the world and is enriched by it, denying **immutability** and often **simplicity**. Both positions essentially reject the classical distinction we have been tracing. They do so, however, by collapsing the ontological distance between Creator and creature. The God of process cannot unilaterally guarantee his promises, because his being is co‑determined with the world. The God of open theism is dependent on creaturely decisions for his knowledge of what will be. In both, the line between absolute and relative attributes is blurred such that God’s very being becomes contingent upon the world.

In defending the classical distinction, one must show not only that it preserves metaphysical coherence, but that it is demanded by central Christian doctrines. The doctrine of creation ex nihilo requires an absolutely independent God whose act to create is free and non‑necessary. If God’s being essentially includes being related to a world, then creation is necessary and God’s freedom is compromised. The doctrine of providence and promise requires that God’s will not be at the mercy of creaturely novelty. The doctrine of the incarnation presupposes that the assumption of a human nature in time does not introduce real change in the divine nature; rather, the Word assumes a created nature into union with his eternal person. Here again, the classical grammar of absolute and relative attributes is operative: the new predicates “is born of Mary” or “suffers under Pontius Pilate” are true of the person of the Son according to the human nature, not as indicating any alteration of the divine nature.

A likely examiner challenge will be to press whether the Thomist and Reformed talk of “relations of reason” trivializes the covenant. The answer must stress that the “of reason” qualifier lies on the side of the distinction, not on the side of the reality. The reality is that God, by his eternal decree, wills to be God‑with‑his‑people, and in time he really brings about those relations in history. That willing is not a temporal decision added to a bare absolute, but the eternal act of the triune God, identical with his essence. To say that “covenant Lord” is a relative attribute is simply to recognize that this name presupposes the existence of a people with whom God covenants. Our language tracks that dependence. It does not imply that God is indifferent in himself to covenant life.

My defended position, therefore, is that the distinction of absolute and relative attributes is a necessary conceptual tool for maintaining the full range of biblical teaching about God while upholding **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and the Creator–creature distinction. In God, the absolute and relative attributes are not really distinct things, but identical with the one simple essence and with each other. The distinction lies in our finite, analogical mode of knowing: sometimes we contemplate God as he is in himself, sometimes as he stands in relation to what he has made and redeemed. Even the relative attributes do not introduce real accidents or changes in God, but signify relations of reason grounded in the eternal decree and the temporal existence of creatures. The critiques that would turn these into real temporal states in God, whether from Scotist‑inspired relational theism, open theism, or process theology, end up undermining divine aseity, God’s freedom in creation and grace, and the reliability of his promises.

Yet this classical position must be constantly calibrated by Scripture and centered in the triune God revealed in Christ. Augustine, Aquinas, Turretin, and Bavinck show that one can affirm a rich, responsive, covenantally engaged God precisely because he is absolutely simple, pure act, and unchangeable in his perfections. The **absolute attributes** are not a metaphysical prison; they are the ground of our confidence that the God who relates himself to us in grace through his **relative attributes** is always and everywhere wholly himself, and that no creaturely event can threaten or modify the fullness of who he eternally is in himself.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **absolute attributes** name God as he is in himself without reference to creatures; **relative attributes** name the same God as he stands in relation to creatures, without implying real changes or accidents in God but expressing relations of reason grounded in his eternal decree and temporal effects.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: early articulation of simplicity and non‑real relations to creatures; all attributes identical with the one immutable essence.
  - Aquinas: systematic account of **divine simplicity**, analogy, and the distinction between absolute and relative names; relations to creatures as extrinsic denominations.
  - Duns Scotus: affirms simplicity yet introduces formal distinctions and univocity; later used to support more intrinsic relationality in God.
  - Turretin: Reformed scholastic reception; integrates absolute and relative attributes with decree and **federal theology**, defending relations of reason against covenantal thinness charges.
  - Bavinck: neo‑Calvinist dogmatician; holds classical view while stressing trinitarian, covenantal, and christological richness of God’s relative attributes.
- Debates:
  - Internal: real vs rational or formal distinctions of attributes; whether “relations of reason” endanger biblical relationality; Reformed use and cautious modification of Thomist grammar.
  - External: nominalism and univocity challenging analogy and simplicity; modern personal theism, panentheism, and process theology making God essentially relational and mutable.
  - Contemporary: divine passibility, open theism, and analytic relational theism claiming God acquires new relational properties and knowledge in time.
- Defended position: in God, absolute and relative attributes are identical with the one simple essence; the distinction is epistemic and analogical, and even relative attributes introduce no intrinsic change in God but only extrinsic denominations founded on his eternal decree and temporal creaturely states.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - Does calling relations to creatures “of reason” make God’s covenant unreal? → No, because the relations of reason are grounded in God’s eternal, efficacious decree and in real historical effects, so that “covenant Lord” truly names who God eternally is as he freely wills to be with his people.
  - How can God be truly responsive if he does not change? → God’s responsiveness is the temporal manifestation of his one eternal will and knowledge; the changes lie in creatures, while his immutable holiness and love are expressed in diverse historical ways.
  - Does Thomist simplicity empty the attributes of content? → No, because analogy secures real, though analogical, content grounded in God’s effects; wisdom, power, and goodness are distinct for us but not as separate parts in God.
  - Why reject the claim that God acquires new relational properties? → Because such acquisition would entail real change and compromise pure actuality and aseity; the new predicates are extrinsic denominations tracking creaturely novelties, not intrinsic modifications in God.
  - How does this bear on the incarnation? → The Son’s assumption of human nature introduces a new relation in creation, not a change in the divine nature; “suffers” and “dies” are predicated of the person according to the human nature while the divine nature remains impassible and immutable.
