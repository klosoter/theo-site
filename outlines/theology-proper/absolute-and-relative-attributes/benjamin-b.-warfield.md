# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached the doctrine of **God’s attributes** with a commitment to classical **Reformed theology**, distinguishing between **absolute attributes** (those belonging to God in Himself) and **relative attributes** (those manifest in relation to creation). He emphasized the unity and simplicity of God, insisting that all attributes are fully present in the divine essence, while the distinction between absolute and relative helps clarify how God is both transcendent and immanent.

- "The distinction between the absolute and relative attributes is not a distinction in God, but only in our conceptions of Him." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "The Biblical Doctrine of God" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "Calvin and Calvinism"
- "The Idea of God and the Moral Law" (in Studies in Theology)
- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Simplicity and Unity**
   - God’s **attributes** are not separable parts but identical with His essence.
   - The distinction between attributes is a matter of human conception, not divine composition.
   - **Absolute and relative attributes** do not divide God’s being.
   - Warfield upholds the classical doctrine of **divine simplicity**.
   - "God is not composed of parts or attributes; He is simple and indivisible." (The Biblical Doctrine of God)

2. **Absolute Attributes Defined**
   - Absolute attributes refer to what God is in Himself, apart from creation.
   - Examples include **eternity**, **immutability**, and **infinity**.
   - These attributes underscore God’s transcendence and self-existence.
   - Warfield affirms that these are foundational to understanding God’s nature.
   - "His absolute attributes are those which belong to Him as God, irrespective of His relation to the world." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

3. **Relative Attributes Defined**
   - Relative attributes describe God as He relates to creation.
   - Examples include **omnipresence**, **omniscience**, and **omnipotence**.
   - These attributes express God’s immanence and activity in the world.
   - Warfield insists these do not imply change or composition in God.
   - "Relative attributes are but the absolute attributes viewed in relation to the created universe." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

4. **Revelation and Accommodation**
   - Human knowledge of God’s attributes is accommodated to our finite understanding.
   - Scripture reveals both absolute and relative attributes for our benefit.
   - Warfield stresses the analogical nature of all theological language about God.
   - The distinction aids in interpreting **biblical revelation** faithfully.
   - "We know God only as He reveals Himself, and our knowledge is always analogical." (The Biblical Doctrine of God)

5. **Continuity with Reformed Orthodoxy**
   - Warfield’s doctrine aligns with the **Westminster Confession** and Reformed scholasticism.
   - He draws on **Calvin** and the **Puritans** in articulating the attribute distinction.
   - Warfield defends the classical categories against modern revisionism.
   - He sees the distinction as vital for preserving both God’s transcendence and immanence.
   - "The Reformed theology has always maintained the distinction as a safeguard of the true doctrine of God." (The Westminster Assembly and Its Work)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s careful articulation of **absolute and relative attributes** reinforced the classical Reformed understanding of **God’s simplicity** and the analogical nature of theological language. His work provided a robust defense against both rationalistic and overly anthropomorphic conceptions of God. Warfield’s influence persists in contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of the doctrine of God and the interpretation of confessional standards. His legacy endures as a model of theological precision and fidelity to the Reformed tradition.
