# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached the distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** within the context of **Reformed dogmatics**, emphasizing the unity and simplicity of God's being. He maintained that while such distinctions are helpful for human understanding, all of God's attributes are ultimately grounded in His **aseity** and **immutability**, and must be understood as expressions of the one, indivisible divine essence.

- "The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is not intended to divide the being of God, but to help us understand the various ways in which God reveals Himself." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Doctrine of God" (in The Princeton Theological Review)
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation (selected essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity and Unity**
    - God’s **attributes** are not separable parts but identical with His essence.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is a conceptual tool, not an ontological division.
    - All attributes, whether absolute (e.g., **eternity**) or relative (e.g., **omnipresence**), are fully possessed by the one God.
    - The unity of God’s being safeguards against any notion of composition or change in God.
    - "The attributes are not additions to the being of God, but are the being itself as variously revealed." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Aseity as Foundational**
    - God’s **aseity** undergirds both His absolute and relative attributes.
    - Absolute attributes (e.g., **independence**, **immutability**) express God’s self-existence.
    - Relative attributes (e.g., **creator**, **preserver**) describe God’s relation to creation, but do not imply change in God.
    - The distinction highlights God’s transcendence and immanence without compromising His self-sufficiency.
    - "Aseity is the root from which all other attributes, both absolute and relative, spring." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Immutability and Divine Action**
    - God’s **immutability** ensures that His relative attributes do not imply change in His essence.
    - Divine actions in history are expressions of God’s eternal will, not alterations in His being.
    - The distinction helps clarify how God can act in time without being subject to temporal change.
    - Vos rejects any view that would compromise God’s unchangeableness for the sake of relationality.
    - "God remains the same in Himself, even as He enters into relation with the world." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

4. **Revelation and Accommodation**
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes arises from the way God **accommodates** Himself to human understanding.
    - Scripture presents God’s attributes in both absolute and relative terms to communicate His fullness.
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - This distinction aids in maintaining both the transcendence and knowability of God.
    - "Our knowledge of God’s attributes is always accommodated to our finite capacity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

5. **Continuity with Reformed Tradition**
    - Vos situates his understanding within classic **Reformed orthodoxy** (e.g., Calvin, Turretin).
    - He affirms the legitimacy of distinguishing attributes for doctrinal clarity, while warning against reifying the distinctions.
    - The distinction serves systematic theology but must be subordinated to biblical revelation.
    - Vos’s approach resists both rationalistic speculation and mystical obscurity.
    - "The Reformed tradition has always maintained that distinctions among the attributes serve to clarify, not divide, the one God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s nuanced handling of the **absolute and relative attributes** has shaped subsequent Reformed theology, particularly in its insistence on the unity and simplicity of God. His careful articulation preserves both the transcendence and immanence of God, influencing later theologians who seek to avoid both modalism and the fragmentation of the divine essence. Vos’s work remains a touchstone for those engaging the doctrine of God within the **confessional Reformed** tradition.
