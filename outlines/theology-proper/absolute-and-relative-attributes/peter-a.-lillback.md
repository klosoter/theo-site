# Peter Lillback (1956–)

Peter Lillback affirms the classical distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** within the doctrine of **God**, emphasizing the importance of this distinction for a robust **Reformed theology**. He maintains that understanding God's **immutability** and **aseity** (absolute attributes) alongside His **relational actions** (relative attributes) is crucial for articulating both divine transcendence and immanence.

- "The distinction between God’s absolute and relative attributes safeguards both His transcendence and His covenantal engagement with creation." (The Binding of God)

## Key Works

- The Binding of God: Calvin’s Role in the Development of Covenant Theology
- "The Attributes of God" (in Solid Ground: The Inerrant Word of God in an Errant World)
- Westminster Confession of Faith: A Commentary (contributor)
- "The Doctrine of God in Reformed Theology" (various lectures and essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Preserves Divine Simplicity**
    - The absolute-relative distinction upholds **divine simplicity** by clarifying that distinctions are conceptual, not ontological.
    - Absolute attributes (e.g., **aseity**, **immutability**) pertain to God's essence apart from creation.
    - Relative attributes (e.g., **mercy**, **justice**) describe God’s actions in relation to the world.
    - This distinction prevents confusion between God’s being and His works.
    - "God’s attributes are not parts of Him, but ways in which He is known to us." (The Binding of God)

2. **Absolute Attributes Ground God’s Transcendence**
    - Attributes such as **eternity**, **immutability**, and **infinity** reveal God’s otherness from creation.
    - These attributes ensure that God is not dependent on or changed by the world.
    - Lillback stresses that **aseity** is foundational for understanding all other attributes.
    - The absolute attributes secure the Creator-creature distinction.
    - "God’s absolute attributes are the bedrock of His transcendence." (The Binding of God)

3. **Relative Attributes Express God’s Covenant Engagement**
    - Relative attributes manifest in God’s dealings with His creatures, especially in **covenant**.
    - Lillback highlights how **mercy**, **justice**, and **faithfulness** are revealed in redemptive history.
    - These attributes do not imply change in God’s essence but reflect His consistent character in relationship.
    - The relative attributes are essential for understanding God’s immanence.
    - "God’s relative attributes are displayed in His covenantal faithfulness." (The Binding of God)

4. **Reformed Tradition’s Emphasis on Both Sets of Attributes**
    - Lillback situates the distinction within the **Reformed confessional** heritage.
    - He draws on the **Westminster Confession** and Calvin’s theology to affirm both absolute and relative attributes.
    - The tradition maintains that both sets are necessary for a full doctrine of God.
    - This balance avoids both deism and pantheism.
    - "The Reformed tradition carefully maintains the distinction to avoid theological extremes." (The Binding of God)

5. **Pastoral and Doctrinal Implications**
    - The distinction shapes worship, prayer, and assurance by grounding them in God’s unchanging character.
    - It provides confidence in God’s promises, rooted in His absolute faithfulness.
    - Lillback applies the doctrine to issues of **providence** and **redemption**.
    - Understanding both sets of attributes enriches the believer’s relationship with God.
    - "A right understanding of God’s attributes leads to deeper trust and reverence." (The Binding of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Peter Lillback has contributed to a renewed appreciation for the **classical doctrine of God** within contemporary Reformed circles, especially through his work on **covenant theology**. His careful articulation of the absolute and relative attributes has influenced both academic and pastoral discussions, reinforcing the importance of maintaining the Creator-creature distinction while celebrating God’s covenantal nearness. Lillback’s teaching and writing continue to shape how Reformed theologians and pastors approach the doctrine of God in relation to worship and practical theology.
