# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl rejected traditional metaphysical distinctions between **absolute and relative attributes** of God, insisting that theological knowledge must be grounded in the **religious value-judgments** of the Christian community. He argued that God's attributes are revealed through His **relation to humanity** in the context of **salvation history**, rather than through speculative philosophy. For Ritschl, the divine attributes are meaningful only as they pertain to God's action in **reconciliation** and the establishment of the **Kingdom of God**.

- "We know God only in His relation to us, not as He is in Himself." (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation (Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung)
- Instruction in the Christian Religion (Unterricht in der christlichen Religion)
- Theology and Metaphysics (Theologie und Metaphysik)
- Albrecht Ritschl and the Problem of the Historical Jesus (secondary: H.R. Mackintosh)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Metaphysical Speculation**
    - Denies the validity of distinguishing between **absolute** and **relative attributes** based on philosophical abstraction.
    - Attributes must be derived from the **historical revelation** of God in Christ.
    - Theology should avoid speculative metaphysics in favor of **practical religious experience**.
    - Theological language is meaningful only within the context of the **Christian community**.
    - "Theology must not transcend the limits of religious knowledge." (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation)

2. **Primacy of Value-Judgments**
    - Attributes of God are understood as **value-judgments** reflecting God's significance for the believer.
    - The distinction between attributes is not ontological but **functional** for faith.
    - Emphasizes the **ethical** and **personal** character of God's attributes.
    - God's attributes are known only as they relate to **human salvation**.
    - "All predicates of God are value-judgments, not metaphysical determinations." (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Christocentric Revelation**
    - The knowledge of God's attributes is mediated through **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ reveals God's character in **historical acts** of reconciliation.
    - The **Kingdom of God** is the context in which divine attributes are disclosed.
    - Attributes such as **love** and **righteousness** are central, as revealed in Christ.
    - "The revelation of God in Christ is the sole source of our knowledge of His attributes." (Instruction in the Christian Religion)

4. **Relational Understanding of Divine Attributes**
    - Attributes are defined by God's **relation to humanity**, not by His essence apart from the world.
    - The distinction between **absolute** and **relative** is replaced by a focus on **God's action** in history.
    - God's attributes are dynamic, manifest in His **redemptive work**.
    - Theological reflection must begin with **God's dealings with the community of faith**.
    - "We must not speculate about God’s nature apart from His relation to us." (Theology and Metaphysics)

5. **Ethical Monotheism**
    - God's attributes are fundamentally **ethical**, especially **love** and **righteousness**.
    - The unity of God's attributes is found in His purpose to establish the **moral order** of the Kingdom.
    - Rejects speculative attributes (e.g., immutability, infinity) unless they serve the ethical revelation.
    - The **moral will of God** is the basis for understanding all divine attributes.
    - "The essence of God is His will for the Kingdom of God." (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s approach to **absolute and relative attributes** profoundly shaped modern **liberal theology**, shifting the focus from metaphysical speculation to the **ethical and relational** dimensions of God’s character. His insistence on grounding theology in **historical revelation** and **community experience** influenced later theologians such as Adolf von Harnack and shaped the trajectory of twentieth-century Protestant thought. While often criticized by confessional traditions for neglecting classical theism, Ritschl’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature and knowability of God’s attributes.
