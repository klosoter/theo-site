# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a classic **Reformed doctrine of God**, distinguishing between God's **absolute attributes** (those belonging to God in Himself) and **relative attributes** (those describing God in relation to creation). These confessions emphasize the **incomprehensibility** and **simplicity** of God, affirming that all divine attributes are fully and perfectly realized in the one, undivided essence of God. The distinction serves to safeguard both the **transcendence** and **immanence** of God within a confessional framework.

- "There is a single and simple spiritual Being, whom we call God—eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, immutable, infinite, almighty, perfectly wise, just, good, and the overflowing fountain of all good." (Belgic Confession, Article 1)

## Key Works

- Canons of Dort, Rejection of Errors I.1

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Simplicity and Unity**
   - God is not composed of parts; His attributes are not separable.
   - All attributes are identical with God’s essence.
   - The distinction between attributes is for human understanding, not in God Himself.
   - Simplicity ensures that God’s **absolute and relative attributes** are not in tension.
   - "We all believe with the heart and confess with the mouth that there is a single and simple spiritual Being, whom we call God." (Belgic Confession, Article 1)

2. **Absolute Attributes: God in Himself**
   - Attributes such as **eternity**, **immutability**, and **infinity** describe God as He is apart from creation.
   - These attributes affirm God’s **transcendence** and independence.
   - God’s absolute attributes are foundational for His reliability and faithfulness.
   - The confessions stress that God’s being is not conditioned by anything outside Himself.
   - "He is eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, immutable, infinite, almighty, perfectly wise, just, good, and the overflowing fountain of all good." (Belgic Confession, Article 1)

3. **Relative Attributes: God in Relation to Creation**
   - Relative attributes (e.g., Creator, Redeemer, Judge) describe God’s actions toward the world.
   - These attributes express God’s **immanence** and covenantal engagement.
   - The confessions affirm that God freely relates to creation without change in His essence.
   - Relative attributes are grounded in God’s eternal decree and providence.
   - "He is the Creator of heaven and earth, and all that is in them." (Belgic Confession, Article 2)

4. **Incomprehensibility and Accommodation**
   - God’s essence and attributes surpass human understanding.
   - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is a tool for finite comprehension.
   - The confessions teach that God reveals Himself truly, though not exhaustively.
   - Language about God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
   - "We know Him by two means: first, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe… second, by His holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Article 2)

5. **Confessional Safeguarding of Divine Mystery**
   - The Three Forms of Unity resist speculative theology about God’s inner being.
   - The distinction upholds both God’s nearness and otherness.
   - The confessions warn against anthropomorphism and rationalism.
   - Worship and doctrine are shaped by reverence for God’s mystery.
   - "We must not presume to subject God’s essence to our reasoning or measure Him by our senses." (Belgic Confession, Article 12)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed confessional theology**, providing a balanced articulation of God’s **absolute and relative attributes** that guards both His transcendence and covenantal nearness. Their careful distinctions have influenced subsequent Reformed dogmatics and catechesis, ensuring that the doctrine of God remains both biblically faithful and philosophically coherent. The confessions continue to serve as a doctrinal standard for Reformed churches worldwide, preserving a robust theology of the divine attributes.
