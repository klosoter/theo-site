# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner addressed the distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** by emphasizing the unity of **God’s self-communication** and the limits of human knowledge of the divine. He maintained that while **God’s essence** remains transcendent and incomprehensible (**absolute attributes**), God’s presence in history and revelation allows for genuine, though analogical, knowledge (**relative attributes**). Rahner’s theology thus bridges **God’s transcendence** and **immanence** through the concept of the **mystery of God**.

- "God is always greater than any concept or attribute we can ascribe to him, yet he truly gives himself in self-communication." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Mystery and Transcendence**
    - God’s **absolute attributes** refer to the divine essence, which is ultimately incomprehensible to finite minds.
    - Human language about God is always analogical, never univocal or purely equivocal.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes safeguards the mystery of God.
    - God’s transcendence is not opposed to his self-communication but grounds it.
    "God is incomprehensible, and every concept of God is surpassed by the reality of God himself." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Analogy in Theological Language**
    - All attributes ascribed to God are analogical, not literal.
    - The analogy of being (**analogia entis**) allows for real knowledge of God while preserving divine mystery.
    - **Absolute attributes** (e.g., simplicity, immutability) are known only through their relative manifestations.
    - The analogical approach avoids both rationalism and agnosticism.
    "We can speak of God only by analogy, for he is always greater than our words." (Theological Investigations)

3. **God’s Self-Communication in History**
    - God’s **relative attributes** are revealed in salvation history and the economy of grace.
    - The self-giving of God in Christ and the Spirit makes divine attributes accessible to human experience.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative is not a separation but a dynamic relationship.
    - Revelation is the event in which God’s absolute mystery becomes present without ceasing to be mystery.
    "God’s self-communication is the event in which his mystery becomes present to us." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Unity of Divine Attributes**
    - God’s attributes are not separate qualities but unified in the divine essence.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative is a function of human perception, not of God’s being.
    - All attributes ultimately point to the one reality of God’s self-giving love.
    - The unity of attributes reflects the unity of God’s act of self-communication.
    "The attributes of God are not parts of God, but ways in which the one God is present to us." (Theological Investigations)

5. **Anthropological Orientation**
    - Human experience and openness to mystery are the starting point for theology.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is meaningful only in relation to human knowledge.
    - The human subject is always addressed by God’s self-communication, which shapes our understanding of divine attributes.
    - Theology must account for both the transcendence and immanence of God in human history.
    "Man is the being who is always already addressed by the mystery of God." (Hearer of the Word)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s approach to **absolute and relative attributes** has profoundly shaped modern Catholic theology, especially in its emphasis on the **mystery of God** and the analogical nature of theological language. His integration of transcendence and immanence has influenced ecumenical dialogues and contemporary understandings of revelation. Rahner’s thought continues to challenge theologians to hold together the unknowability and self-giving of God in a unified vision.
