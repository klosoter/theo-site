# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards provide a classic Reformed articulation of the distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** in the doctrine of God. By distinguishing between what God is in Himself (**aseity**, **immutability**, **simplicity**) and how He relates to creation (**goodness**, **mercy**, **justice**), the Standards safeguard the **immutability** and **aseity** of God while affirming His active engagement with the world.

- "There is but one only, living, and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions..." (Westminster Confession of Faith 2.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 2 ("Of God, and of the Holy Trinity")
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 7–11
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 4–6
- A.A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine
- John Murray, "The Theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith" (in Collected Writings, vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Absolute Attributes Are Essential and Incommunicable**
   - Absolute attributes include **aseity**, **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **infinity**.
   - These attributes describe what God is in Himself, apart from creation.
   - They are not shared with creatures and distinguish God’s being from all else.
   - The Standards stress that God is "without body, parts, or passions," underscoring His absolute nature.
   "God is a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions..." (WCF 2.1)

2. **Relative Attributes Express God’s Relationship to Creation**
   - Relative attributes include **goodness**, **mercy**, **justice**, and **wisdom** as exercised toward creatures.
   - These attributes describe how God reveals Himself in His works and providence.
   - They do not imply change in God’s essence but reflect His eternal purpose manifested in time.
   - The Standards maintain that God’s actions toward creation are consistent with His absolute being.
   "God executeth his decrees in the works of creation and providence." (WSC 8)

3. **Unity of the Divine Attributes**
   - All attributes, whether absolute or relative, are perfectly united in the one simple essence of God.
   - There is no division or composition in God; distinctions are for human understanding.
   - The Standards reject any suggestion that God’s attributes are parts or that He is composite.
   - The unity of attributes preserves the doctrine of **divine simplicity**.
   "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity..." (WCF 2.3)

4. **Immutability and Impassibility Safeguard God’s Absolute Attributes**
   - God does not change in His being, purposes, or promises.
   - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes protects against attributing change or passion to God.
   - God’s **impassibility** means He is not subject to emotional fluctuations as creatures are.
   - The Standards emphasize that God’s relative actions do not compromise His immutability.
   "With whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning." (WLC 7)

5. **Revelation Accommodates Human Understanding**
   - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is a tool for finite comprehension of the infinite God.
   - Scripture reveals God truly, though not exhaustively, using both absolute and relative terms.
   - The Standards encourage reverence and humility in theological language about God.
   - The use of relative attributes does not diminish the reality of God’s absolute perfections.
   "God is infinite in being and perfection..." (WSC 4)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology’s doctrine of God**, providing a framework for distinguishing between God’s essence and His works. Their careful articulation of **absolute and relative attributes** has influenced confessional statements, catechetical instruction, and systematic theology in the Presbyterian and broader Reformed traditions. This distinction continues to serve as a safeguard for the doctrines of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and the Creator-creature distinction, ensuring that God’s transcendence and immanence are both upheld in orthodox theology.
