### ESSAY
The distinction between absolute and relative attributes seeks to name the ways God is in himself and the ways he is toward another. It presses immediately on the nerve of **divine simplicity**: if God is utterly one, without parts or accidents, can there be genuine differences in how we name him? Conversely, if Scripture ubiquitously speaks of God as Creator, Lord, Judge, and Redeemer, do these relative names entail a real alteration in God upon the advent of the creature? The classical answer articulates a grammar that distinguishes ad intra and ad extra while safeguarding **immutability** and **aseity**. Absolute attributes signify the divine essence as such, not implying a correlative other. Relative attributes signify the same essence under a relation, either the real subsistent relations that constitute Father, Son, and Spirit ad intra, or the ad extra relations to creation which are, in God, denominative according to reason because they terminate in the creature’s change. This grammar was forged in the patristic defense of the Trinity, systematized by high scholastic theology, received and refined by Reformed scholasticism, and in our time challenged by various relational theisms and analytic critiques of simplicity.

Augustine forged decisive tools for talking about relative names in the context of anti-Arian polemics. In De Trinitate he insists that certain names applied to God, such as good and great, denote what he is in himself, while others, such as Lord and Creator, imply a relation to creatures. Even more crucially, he introduces the idea that the personal names of Father and Son are not names of essence but of relation, distinguishing the persons without multiplying substances. He holds that the Father is not called Father with respect to himself but with respect to the Son; the relation is real and eternal in God, constituting personal distinction without division. This Augustinian grammar prevents us from confusing absolute and relative names, and it anchors the entire topic in the doctrine of the Trinity. If an examiner presses whether these relations introduce composition in God, Augustine’s counter would be that relation in God is not an accident inhering in a subject but a way of signifying the subsistent reality of the persons. The Father is not good by relation, but he is Father by relation; the relation is identical with the substance according to being, yet different according to its relational opposition. Already Augustine points toward the later thesis that divine names are predicated analogically, not univocally or equivocally, because what in creatures is an accident is in God identified with his essence. Augustine’s contribution is a relational grammar that allows real relational distinction ad intra without positing accidents in God, and a preliminary discernment of relative names ad extra that protect **immutability** by locating the newness on the side of the creature who comes to be under the Lordship of God.

Thomas Aquinas sharpens Augustine’s insights with metaphysical precision. His treatment of divine names and relations is the classical locus for the absolute–relative distinction. First, Aquinas argues from **divine simplicity** that there can be no composition of substance and accident in God; all that is in God is God. Consequently, divine attributes do not name parts or properties added to an essence; they name the one essence under different aspects. Absolute names such as goodness, wisdom, and life signify that essence absolutely. Relative names raise a problem: relation is a category that in creatures is an accident. Aquinas replies that relation can be said of God in two ways. Ad intra, he teaches that the personal relations are real and subsistent, not as accidents inhering in a subject, but as the divine essence subsisting in a relative mode. The opposition of relations constitutes the distinction of persons while the identity of essence maintains unity. One does not thereby introduce composition because the relations are not things added to essence, but the essence itself as relatively opposed. Ad extra, Aquinas argues that the relations denoted by names like Creator and Lord are not real relations in God at all. They are relations of reason only, founded on a real relation in creatures. When the world begins, God does not undergo any real modification; rather, creatures newly stand in a relation of dependence to God. We truthfully call God Creator because of an extrinsic denomination from his effects. This does not make the predication empty, because the extrinsic denomination terminates in God’s real and eternal act of will and knowledge. Creation is the creature’s newness, not God’s.

Aquinas’s doctrine of analogical naming tightens the account. We name God from creatures by way of eminence and removal. Absolute names are attributed to God not univocally as properties in a subject, but analogically as the one actus purus who is his own goodness. Relative names are also analogical, with ad intra relations named purely from revelation because they exceed the grasp of natural reason, and ad extra relations named poetically and metaphysically from God’s effects. Here Aquinas is careful to employ the notion of appropriation in catechesis, where certain absolute attributes are appropriated to distinct persons to teach without dividing the essence. Power to the Father, wisdom to the Son, love to the Spirit are relative pedagogical attributions, not real distinctions of essence. The architecture thus established integrates absolute attributes, real relations ad intra, and relations ad extra as relations of reason. Pressed by the examiner whether this extrinsic denomination reduces God’s relational names to mere projections, the Thomistic answer is that the denomination is founded on God’s real causal act, which is his very essence under the aspect of will and knowledge. The distinction is cognitive and predicational in us because there is no composition in God, yet it is not arbitrary because the foundation in the creature’s real relation fixes the truth of the predication. With this, Aquinas secures **immutability** and **aseity** while giving full weight to Scripture’s relational language.

John Duns Scotus agrees with Aquinas on **divine simplicity** and **immutability** but rejects some of Aquinas’s semantic parsings. Two contributions are decisive for our topic. First, Scotus articulates the formal distinction a parte rei, whereby there is a distinction that is less than real but more than purely logical between formalities in a simple subject. Applied to the attributes, this explains how the one essence can be formally distinct as wisdom and as power, without composition. The formal distinction aims to protect the non-collapse of attributes and to underwrite real theological statements about God without falling into a merely conceptual plurality. This bears on absolute attributes directly, offering a way to account for their non-interchangeability in predication. Second, Scotus contends that certain ad extra relations are real in God without implication of dependency or change. He wishes to avoid the impression that relational names are semantically vacuous. He argues that divine knowledge of creatures and divine will with respect to creatures are really related to creatures in a way founded on God’s internal acts, which are eternal. The relation is real because its foundation is intrinsic to God, even though the correlate in creatures is temporal and dependent. This proposal preserves **immutability** while retaining more ontological bite for ad extra relations than Aquinas allowed. Thomists counter that any real relation is either identical with the essence, in which case it would introduce no multiplicity and thus no determinate relation to this creature rather than that, or it would introduce a categorial accident, which is impossible. Scotus replies by deploying the formal distinction and by differentiating the modes of relation such that priority and dependence are not entailed by every real relation. The internal debate is significant because it frames two classical strategies for preserving absolute perfections alongside relative predications: the Thomist strategy of extrinsic denomination, and the Scotist strategy of real but non-dependent relations grounded in eternal divine acts. Each strategy insists that ad intra personal relations are real and constitutive.

Reformed scholasticism inherits the patristic and medieval tools and deploys them within a biblical-covenantal frame. Francis Turretin gives the most careful Reformed presentation of absolute and relative attributes. He affirms **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability**, and he distinguishes absolute attributes that express what God is in himself, like infinity, perfection, and holiness, from relative attributes that express what God is in relation to creatures, like Lord, Creator, and Redeemer. Turretin is vigilant in preserving the biblical richness of divine names while avoiding any hint of composition in God. He adopts the scholastic doctrine of extrinsic denomination ad extra: the new relation is in the creature, not in God. He brings the distinction between attributes and works into view: attributes ascriptions name what God is, works ascriptions name what God does. The relative names arise principally from works ad extra and thus are contingent upon the existence of creatures, whereas the absolute names are necessary. Turretin also integrates the distinction with the Reformed communicable–incommunicable schema. The absolute–relative distinction cuts across the communicable–incommunicable distinction: holiness is absolute and communicable by analogy, whereas Creator is relative and incommunicable. This interlacing shows that the scholastic classification is heuristic, not ontological subdivision.

Turretin applies this grammar to contested loci in his day. He rejects the Socinian inference that God’s foreknowledge and governance imply change and learning. For Turretin, God does not acquire knowledge; ad extra changes are changes of the effect. He leans on the doctrine of **analogical knowledge**: our predications pick out true perfections in God, though under a creaturely mode. He also deploys the Augustinian rule that personal names are relative: the confession of Trinity is preserved by admitting real subsistent relations ad intra while upholding one essence. The Reformed covenantal narrative adds no metaphysical additions to God, but the economy reveals relative names in time. When pressed whether the covenant name Redeemer introduces a new real relation in God at the cross, Turretin would answer that the newness is economic, located in the history of Christ and the Spirit’s application, while the will that grounds redemption is eternal and simple in God. Turretin’s strength is systematic coherence: absolute and relative attributes are conceptually ordered under **simplicity** and understood in relation to decree, creation, providence, and redemption. His strategy mirrors Aquinas on ad extra relations and follows Augustine on ad intra relations, but he locates the distinction’s pastoral importance in catechesis and polemics against anti-trinitarian and anti-providential errors.

In modern analytic philosophy of religion, Alvin Plantinga’s critique of **divine simplicity** reconfigures the terrain. In Does God Have a Nature he argues that if God is identical to his attributes, then God is identical to a property, which is absurd; if God is identical to each of many properties, then those properties are identical to one another, which erases real distinction between divine wisdom and divine power and makes all properties necessary truths identical. He further contends that such identity would collapse the distinction between God and his nature and thereby threaten divine freedom. Plantinga’s challenge, widely influential, is not principally about relative attributes, but it bears directly on the absolute–relative framework by undermining the metaphysical engine that sustains it. If simplicity goes, the temptation is to treat divine attributes as a set of properties possibly in tension, and relative names as registering real alterations in God as he acquires or loses relational properties. The classical response is threefold. First, the identity thesis does not identify God with a universal property, but with his singular subsistent act of being, which is not a property in the modern sense. Second, the collapse objection fails to track the semantic range of predication; distinctions among attributes are distinctions of reason with a foundation in reality or formal distinctions that do not entail composition, which is adequate to ground true, non-redundant predications. Third, divine freedom is secured by distinguishing the necessity of God’s willing himself from the contingency of his willing creatures. The Thomist will add that since God’s act is his essence, the variety of effects is not grounded in a variety of acts in God but in the perfection of a single simple act capable of producing diverse effects without intrinsically varying. Thus, even in the face of Plantinga’s critique, the absolute–relative distinction can stand if the classical semantics of divine naming and the ontology of **actus purus** are maintained.

The internal debates about the distinction are not merely scholastic intricacies; they chart viable options for maintaining confessional commitments. Between Aquinas and Scotus, the focal question is whether ad extra relative names point to a real relation in God. The Thomist wins clarity about **immutability** by assigning all such relations to extrinsic denomination. The Scotist wins ontological traction by admitting real relations grounded in eternal acts, yet without dependence. A Reformed scholastic like Turretin sides with the Thomist for ad extra and takes the Scotist’s formalist impulse via a distinctio rationis cum fundamento in re to preserve the intelligibility of manifold predication. A likely examiner challenge here is whether Scotus’s real relations smuggle in composition. The Scotist answer is that a relation is not necessarily an accident; it can be a mode of the essence without additive ontology, and the real relation is eternal and grounded in God’s simple act. The Thomist rejoinder is that such a category blurs the boundary between real and rational distinctions, and is unnecessary for grounding robust predication. Either path must insist that ad intra relations are real and constitutive, otherwise the Trinity evaporates.

Externally, process theism and open theism insist that the biblical God is essentially relational and thus changes in response to the world. They reject the absolute–relative grammar as metaphysically imported, claiming it silences Scripture’s drama of covenant. They argue that for God to be Lord in any meaningful sense, he must acquire new relational properties as creatures act. Classical theism replies by distinguishing two modes of change. There are intrinsic changes, which the tradition denies of God to maintain **immutability** and **aseity**, and there are Cambridge changes, which are shifts in relational description brought about by changes in the other term. God does not become something new intrinsically when he begins to be called Creator; rather, creatures come to be in dependence, and thus God is truly called Creator by an **extrinsic denomination** fixed by the creature’s newness and God’s eternal will. The charge of trivializing relation is met by locating all divine responsiveness in the created effect of the eternal decree. The covenant, prayer, and providence are not fictions but the temporal actualizations of a simple eternal plan. The divine act is free and personal, not mechanistic, because it is the act of a triune agent whose ad intra relations ground the deepest model of personal communion. The **impassibility** debate is clarified by the distinction: absolute impassibility denies that God is modified by external causes; relative predications tell us how creatures stand under his unchanging goodness and love. The suffering of Christ belongs to the incarnate person according to the human nature; the deity remains impassible. If one insists that love must entail passibility, the Augustinian-Thomist reply is that divine love is not a passion but a volitional perfection; it is more, not less, than creaturely affection.

Contemporary analytic theology raises a different question: what is the truthmaker for relational predications of God if they are merely extrinsic? The classical answer is that the creature’s state plus God’s simple eternal act of will and knowledge suffice. We do not need an intrinsic relational accident in God to make true that God is Lord of Israel after the Exodus. The causal history and decree ground the truth. If pushed that this model undermines God’s being genuinely with his people, we should insist that presence and covenantal intimacy are not measured by ontological change in God but by the modes of communion God freely effects in creatures. The sacraments are not changes in God but changes in us by which we are brought into participation in his life. Here the absolute–relative distinction guards the Creator–creature boundary without diminishing the reality of grace.

The distinction also integrates with adjacent loci. In Trinity, it tells us how the persons differ by real relations of origin, while the essence is named by absolute perfections. In decree and providence, it explains how the one simple act grounds manifold effects without change. In Christology, it preserves the integrity of the incarnation as a temporal event without implying that the divine nature changed; the person of the Son assumes a human nature in time, a relation real in the assumed humanity and hypostatic union, not a modification of deity. In soteriology, calling God Redeemer and Justifier are relative names that follow from completed works in history, fixed in their terminus ad quem in the elect. The law–gospel dialectic registers in us and in history; God’s righteousness and mercy remain absolute perfections. In **federal theology**, the covenant names of God are economic and relative, theologically weighty because they situate the church within God’s unchanging purposes. Across these loci, the absolute–relative grammar prevents the common fallacy of moving from God’s acts to alterations in God’s being.

One last internal caution: the temptation is to weaponize the absolute–relative distinction into an abstract taxonomy. The classical doctors insist that these are modes of naming, not divisions in God. Augustine and Aquinas stress that in God all perfections are one. Scotus gives a formalism to protect non-triviality in predication. Turretin embeds the account within a dogmatic system governed by Scripture and the rule of faith. The position defended here is a Thomist-Reformed construal: ad intra relations are real and subsistent, constituting the persons; ad extra relations deliver true relative names by **extrinsic denomination**, founded in God’s one eternal act, which is identical with his essence; absolute attributes signify the same essence without reference to another. The Scotist approach can be mined for its defense of non-collapse in predication through a distinction of formalities, but without conceding that real relations ad extra are necessary. To objections that this makes God metaphysically static and personally inert, we reply that personhood does not require change. The triune life is infinite fullness of act. Our encounter with that life in history is as temporal beings brought into participation with the eternal. That participation is not reducible to our concepts of relation, which are formed from finite composites; hence the indispensability of **analogical knowledge**.

Examiners will rightly press on biblical exegesis. Does the Old Testament not present God as becoming angry, repenting, or relenting? The answer returns to analogy and accommodation. These are true disclosures of God’s dealings, articulated under the mode of human passions to communicate his righteous opposition to sin and his genuine favor. The underlying absolute perfection is **immutability**; the relative names direct us to the creaturely effects by which God makes himself known as just and merciful. On the New Testament climax, the cross is not a change in God but the historical enactment of the eternal wisdom whereby the Son in his assumed humanity bears curse for our salvation. Scripture’s primary discourse is economic; metaphysics clarifies the ontological presuppositions without rewriting exegesis.

Finally, we anticipate a charge from theistic personalism: that classical theism posits an apersonal absolute whose relations are semantic facades. The classical answer is Christological and trinitarian. The absolute perfections belong to a living triune God. Ad intra relations are the supreme instance of personal communion, irreducible and real. Ad extra relations are the expressions of triune wisdom in creation and redemption, not addenda to a bare essence. The absolute–relative distinction therefore is not a cold dichotomy but a language rule that protects the gospel from collapsing God into the world or the world into God, and that grounds assurance that his covenant love is unwavering precisely because he is who he is. The name I am sets the absolute frame; the name Lord, given in the Exodus, names the relative history of his unchanging faithfulness. The grammar is not optional for catholic Christianity. It is constitutive of coherent confession.
