# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirms the distinction between **absolute** and **relative attributes** of God, emphasizing that while God's essence is singular and simple, His attributes are revealed to us according to our finite understanding. Calvin insists that all divine attributes—whether describing God's being in Himself (**absolute**, such as **aseity** or **immutability**) or His relation to creation (**relative**, such as **mercy** or **justice**)—are not parts of God but ways in which the one, simple God is known.

- "We must not think of God’s attributes as if they were so many qualities attached to His essence, or as if His essence were divisible into so many parts." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, I.13.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 10–14)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on Genesis and Psalms
- Sermons on Job
- The Bondage and Liberation of the Will
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity**
    - God’s essence is undivided and uncompounded.
    - All attributes are identical with God’s essence, not separable qualities.
    - The distinction between attributes is for human comprehension, not an ontological division in God.
    - Simplicity safeguards the unity and transcendence of God.
    - "God’s attributes are not parts of God, but modes in which His nature is known to us." (Institutes I.13.2)

2. **Absolute Attributes as Essential**
    - Attributes like **eternity**, **immutability**, and **aseity** pertain to God’s being in Himself.
    - These attributes are not dependent on creation or any external relation.
    - Calvin stresses that such attributes reveal God’s transcendence and independence.
    - Absolute attributes are foundational for understanding God’s other perfections.
    - "When we speak of God’s eternity, we remove all idea of beginning and end." (Institutes I.13.3)

3. **Relative Attributes as Revealed in Relation**
    - Relative attributes (e.g., **justice**, **mercy**) describe God’s actions toward creation.
    - These are not changes in God but in the way creatures experience Him.
    - Calvin warns against projecting creaturely change onto God’s nature.
    - Relative attributes help us understand God’s dealings in redemptive history.
    - "When God is said to repent, it is not that His will is changed, but that He appears to us as if He repented." (Institutes I.17.13)

4. **Anthropomorphic Accommodation**
    - God accommodates His revelation to human capacity.
    - The language of attributes is adapted for our limited understanding.
    - Calvin frequently notes the use of **anthropomorphism** in Scripture.
    - This accommodation does not compromise God’s transcendence or simplicity.
    - "For who is so devoid of intellect as not to understand that God, in so speaking, lisps with us as nurses are wont to do with little children?" (Institutes I.13.1)

5. **Unity of the Divine Essence**
    - All attributes are ultimately unified in God’s single essence.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative is epistemological, not ontological.
    - Calvin resists any division of God’s being based on His attributes.
    - The unity of essence ensures the coherence of God’s self-revelation.
    - "Whatever is said of God is said with reference to our capacity, not to the reality of His nature." (Institutes I.13.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of the **absolute and relative attributes** distinction has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, providing a framework for understanding God’s simplicity and self-revelation. His careful balance between divine transcendence and accommodation influenced later confessional formulations and systematic theology. Calvin’s insistence on the unity of God’s essence remains foundational in discussions of the divine attributes, ensuring that God’s perfections are seen as modes of His one, simple being rather than as separable qualities.
