# Richard A. Muller (1948– )

Richard A. Muller is a leading scholar of **Reformed scholasticism** and the development of **classical theism**. On the topic of **absolute and relative attributes**, Muller emphasizes the historical-theological distinctions made by early modern Reformed theologians, showing how these categories served to articulate the **immutability** and **simplicity** of God while safeguarding divine **aseity** and the reality of God's relation to creation.

- "The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is a function of the relation of God to the world, not of any real composition in the divine being." (Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: The Divine Essence and Attributes
- Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms
- After Calvin: Studies in the Development of a Theological Tradition
- "Divine Simplicity, Divine Freedom, and the Contingency of Creation: Dogmatic Developments and the Legacy of Reformed Orthodoxy" (Calvin Theological Journal)
- The Unaccommodated Calvin: Studies in the Foundation of a Theological Tradition

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical-Critical Recovery of Attribute Distinctions**
   - Argues that **absolute and relative attributes** are rooted in patristic and Reformed traditions, not medieval inventions.
   - Shows how these distinctions clarify the difference between what God is in himself (**absolute**) and how God relates to creation (**relative**).
   - Emphasizes the terminological precision of early modern Reformed theologians.
   - Highlights the importance of these distinctions for **systematic theology**.
   "The Reformed orthodox did not invent the distinction but inherited and refined it for their own dogmatic purposes." (PRRD, vol. 3)

2. **Divine Simplicity and the Attribute Distinctions**
   - Maintains that the distinction does not compromise **divine simplicity**.
   - Absolute and relative attributes are epistemological, not ontological, distinctions.
   - Warns against reading real composition into God based on these categories.
   - Attributes are different ways of understanding the one, simple divine essence.
   "The distinction is not a division in God but a distinction in our way of conceiving God’s relation to the world." (PRRD, vol. 3)

3. **Immutability and Relational Language**
   - Asserts that **immutability** is preserved even as God is described in relation to creation.
   - Relative attributes (e.g., Creator, Redeemer) do not imply change in God.
   - The language of relation is accommodated to human understanding.
   - The distinction protects against anthropomorphism in theology proper.
   "Relative attributes do not indicate change in God but change in the relation of creatures to God." (PRRD, vol. 3)

4. **Aseity and Divine Freedom**
   - Absolute attributes (e.g., **aseity**, eternity) underscore God's independence from creation.
   - Relative attributes express God's free acts ad extra, not necessity.
   - The distinction upholds the **Creator-creature distinction**.
   - Divine freedom is not compromised by God's relative attributes.
   "God’s relative attributes are grounded in his free decision to create and redeem, not in any necessity of his being." (PRRD, vol. 3)

5. **Dogmatic Utility and Theological Method**
   - The distinction aids in doctrinal clarity and systematic formulation.
   - Provides a framework for discussing **God’s knowability** and revelation.
   - Helps avoid confusion between God’s essence and his works.
   - Supports the analogical nature of theological language.
   "The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is a methodological tool for the proper ordering of theological discourse." (PRRD, vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Muller's scholarship has profoundly shaped the contemporary understanding of **Reformed orthodoxy** and its approach to the doctrine of God. By clarifying the historical use and theological significance of the absolute-relative attribute distinction, he has influenced both academic and confessional discussions of **divine simplicity** and **immutability**. His work ensures that modern theologians engage these categories with historical nuance and doctrinal precision, reinforcing their ongoing relevance in systematic theology.
