# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the question of **absolute and relative attributes** by emphasizing the dynamic and relational character of God’s self-revelation. He rejected a purely philosophical or abstract distinction, insisting that the **attributes of God** must be understood in light of **divine revelation** and the **personal encounter** between God and humanity. For Brunner, the so-called "absolute" and "relative" attributes are inseparable in the living God who acts in history.

- "God is not to be conceived as the sum of His attributes, but as the Living God who reveals Himself in His acts." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. I)
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Truth as Encounter
- Man in Revolt

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Personal Encounter**
   - God’s attributes are known only through His self-revelation, not abstract speculation.
   - The distinction between **absolute** and **relative** attributes is secondary to the reality of God’s personal engagement with humanity.
   - Revelation is always relational, involving both God and the human recipient.
   - The attributes of God are encountered in His acts, not deduced from metaphysical principles.
   - "God reveals Himself as Person, not as a system of attributes." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Unity of God’s Attributes**
   - Brunner resists dividing God’s attributes into separate categories that threaten divine unity.
   - The so-called "absolute" and "relative" attributes are united in the living God.
   - All attributes are expressions of God’s one will and character.
   - The distinction is a human tool, not a reflection of God’s inner being.
   - "The unity of God is not the unity of an idea, but the unity of a living Person." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

3. **Critique of Classical Theism**
   - Brunner critiques traditional scholastic distinctions as overly abstract.
   - He argues that classical theism’s emphasis on **immutability** and **impassibility** risks making God remote.
   - The living God is not static but acts in history and relates to His creation.
   - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes must not undermine God’s personal nature.
   - "The God of the philosophers is not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." (Revelation and Reason)

4. **Christological Focus**
   - The revelation of God in Christ is central for understanding divine attributes.
   - In Jesus, both the majesty (absolute) and love (relative) of God are revealed.
   - The incarnation unites transcendence and immanence in one person.
   - Christ is the concrete revelation of all God’s attributes.
   - "In Christ, the absolute and the relative meet in the one act of divine love." (The Mediator)

5. **Relational Ontology**
   - God’s being is fundamentally relational, not abstractly absolute.
   - The attributes of God are best understood through His relationship with humanity.
   - Brunner emphasizes the **personal** and **covenantal** nature of God’s actions.
   - The distinction between attributes serves to highlight God’s engagement with the world.
   - "God’s being is being-in-relation; His attributes are the forms of His personal self-giving." (Truth as Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **absolute and relative attributes** influenced modern Protestant theology by challenging static, metaphysical conceptions of God. His emphasis on **revelation** and the **personal nature of God** encouraged a more dynamic and relational understanding of divine attributes. Brunner’s work remains significant for those seeking to integrate classical doctrine with the realities of biblical revelation and existential encounter. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of God’s attributes and the relationship between theology and philosophy.
