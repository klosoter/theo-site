# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame challenges the traditional distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** of God, arguing that all divine attributes are both absolute and relational within the context of **covenant lordship**. He emphasizes the **multiperspectival** nature of theology, insisting that God's attributes must be understood in light of His **lordship**, **self-sufficiency**, and **personal relationship** with creation.

- "God’s attributes are not divided into absolute and relative, but each attribute is both absolute and relative, depending on the perspective." (The Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- No Other God: A Response to Open Theism (2001)
- Perspectives on the Word of God (1990)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the Absolute/Relative Dichotomy**
    - Argues that dividing God's attributes into absolute (in Himself) and relative (toward creation) is artificial.
    - Maintains that every attribute has both an absolute and a relational aspect.
    - Sees this dichotomy as rooted in unbiblical philosophical categories.
    - Insists that all attributes are revealed in the context of God's relationship with His people.
    - "The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is not found in Scripture, but is a product of philosophical speculation." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Multiperspectivalism in Divine Attributes**
    - Attributes must be understood from multiple perspectives: normative, situational, and existential.
    - No single perspective exhausts the richness of God's character.
    - Each attribute reveals God's lordship in a unique way.
    - Multiperspectivalism guards against reductionism in theology.
    - "Each attribute is a perspective on God’s lordship, and all are interrelated." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Covenant Lordship as Central**
    - God's attributes are best understood through the lens of His covenant lordship.
    - Lordship entails **authority**, **control**, and **presence**.
    - Attributes manifest in God's dealings with His covenant people.
    - The unity of God's attributes is displayed in His redemptive acts.
    - "God’s attributes are the ways in which he exercises his lordship over creation." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Unity and Simplicity of God**
    - Attributes are not separate parts of God but expressions of His unified being.
    - The simplicity of God means His attributes are identical with His essence.
    - Distinctions among attributes are for human understanding, not divisions in God.
    - Unity prevents the fragmentation of God's character into isolated qualities.
    - "God’s attributes are not parts of him, but ways of describing his simple, unified nature." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Revelational Epistemology**
    - Knowledge of God's attributes comes through His self-revelation in Scripture.
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    - The Bible presents God's attributes in the context of His acts in history.
    - Theological reflection must be governed by the pattern of biblical revelation.
    - "We know God’s attributes as he reveals them in his mighty acts and words." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s critique of the **absolute and relative attributes** distinction has significantly influenced contemporary Reformed theology, especially in its approach to the doctrine of God. His **multiperspectivalism** has encouraged theologians to approach divine attributes with greater nuance and biblical fidelity. Frame’s emphasis on **covenant lordship** and the unity of God’s attributes continues to shape discussions on the nature of God in both academic and ecclesial contexts.
