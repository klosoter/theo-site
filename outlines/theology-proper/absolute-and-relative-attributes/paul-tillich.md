# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich reinterpreted the **absolute and relative attributes** of God through his framework of **theology of correlation** and **ontological analysis**. He rejected classical theism’s static distinctions, instead emphasizing God as the **Ground of Being** whose attributes are symbolic expressions of the divine’s relation to existence and finitude.

- "God does not exist. He is being-itself beyond essence and existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1–3
- The Courage to Be
- Dynamics of Faith
- Theology of Culture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as the Ground of Being**
   - God is not a being among beings but the very **Ground of Being** itself.
   - Absolute and relative attributes are symbolic, not literal, descriptions of divine reality.
   - The distinction points to the tension between God’s transcendence and immanence.
   - Attributes express the way finite beings experience the infinite.
   - "God is being-itself, not a being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Symbolic Nature of Divine Attributes**
   - All language about God, including attributes, is **symbolic** and points beyond itself.
   - Absolute attributes symbolize God’s transcendence; relative attributes symbolize God’s immanence.
   - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point but do not exhaust it.
   - The distinction is necessary for meaningful theological discourse but always provisional.
   - "Every statement about God is symbolic." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Rejection of Ontotheology**
   - Tillich opposes the idea of God as a supreme being with definable attributes.
   - Absolute and relative categories are critiqued as products of **essentialist metaphysics**.
   - God transcends all finite categories, including those of attribute and relation.
   - The classical distinction is reinterpreted within existential and ontological frameworks.
   - "God is beyond the difference between subject and object." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Correlation of Divine and Human**
   - The attributes of God correlate with human existential questions.
   - Absolute attributes answer the question of ultimate concern; relative attributes address God’s participation in history.
   - The distinction is meaningful only within the context of human experience and existential need.
   - Theology must relate divine attributes to the structure of human existence.
   - "The method of correlation explains the contents of the Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Dynamic Unity of Divine Attributes**
   - God’s attributes are unified dynamically, not statically divided.
   - The absolute and relative are dialectically related, not mutually exclusive.
   - Divine unity is preserved through the interplay of transcendence and immanence.
   - The living God is encountered in the dynamic tension of these attributes.
   - "The living God is the God who is creative, saving, and fulfilling." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s reinterpretation of **absolute and relative attributes** challenged classical metaphysics and influenced modern **systematic theology** by emphasizing the symbolic and existential dimensions of divine language. His approach shaped later discussions on the limits of theological language and the relationship between transcendence and immanence. Tillich’s thought remains a touchstone for those seeking to articulate the mystery of God in a post-metaphysical context.
