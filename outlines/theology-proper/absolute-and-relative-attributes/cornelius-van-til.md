# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the question of **absolute and relative attributes** within the doctrine of God through the lens of **Reformed confessionalism** and a robust **Creator-creature distinction**. He rejected any separation between God's **incommunicable** and **communicable attributes** that would compromise divine simplicity, insisting that all of God's attributes are fully present in every act and revelation of God, yet always qualitatively distinct from the creaturely analogues.

- "God’s attributes are not so many parts of Him, nor are they to be separated from His essence or from one another." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute and Relative Attributes Are Distinct but Inseparable**
    - Van Til affirms the traditional distinction but insists it must not divide God's unity.
    - The **absolute attributes** (e.g., aseity, immutability) and **relative attributes** (e.g., omnipresence, omniscience) are always co-inherent.
    - Any distinction is for human understanding, not a division in God Himself.
    - The distinction serves to protect both God's transcendence and His immanence.
    - "We must not separate the attributes of God from one another or from the being of God." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction as Foundational**
    - God’s attributes are qualitatively different from human attributes.
    - The distinction ensures that God’s absoluteness is never compromised by His relation to creation.
    - All analogical knowledge of God’s attributes is grounded in revelation.
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** prevents any confusion between divine and human properties.
    - "God is absolute; man is finite and dependent." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Rejection of Purely Philosophical Categories**
    - Van Til critiques classical theism’s use of Greek philosophical terms for God’s attributes.
    - He insists that **biblical revelation** must govern our understanding of God’s attributes.
    - The absolute-relative distinction must be reinterpreted in light of the Trinity and covenant.
    - Philosophical abstraction leads to a static or impersonal view of God.
    - "The God of Christianity is not the God of the philosophers." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Divine Simplicity and Perichoresis**
    - All of God’s attributes are identical with His essence and with each other.
    - The **simplicity of God** means no attribute is more fundamental than another.
    - Perichoretic unity of attributes reflects the unity of the **Trinitarian persons**.
    - Any distinction is only conceptual, not real or ontological.
    - "In God, all attributes are one; they interpenetrate and are coextensive." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Analogical Knowledge of God’s Attributes**
    - Human knowledge of God’s attributes is always analogical, never univocal or equivocal.
    - We know God truly, but not exhaustively, as He reveals Himself.
    - The absolute-relative distinction is a tool for analogical predication.
    - **Revelation** is the only basis for speaking rightly about God’s attributes.
    - "All our knowledge of God is analogical, based on His self-revelation." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **absolute and relative attributes** has shaped Reformed theology’s engagement with classical theism, emphasizing the necessity of the **Creator-creature distinction** and the analogical nature of theological language. His insistence on divine simplicity and the unity of God’s attributes has influenced generations of theologians, particularly within the **presuppositional apologetics** tradition. Van Til’s legacy endures in debates over the relationship between philosophy and theology, and in the ongoing effort to articulate a robustly biblical doctrine of God.
