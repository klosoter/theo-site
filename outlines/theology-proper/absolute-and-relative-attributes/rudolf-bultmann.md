# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the question of **absolute and relative attributes** through his existential and dialectical interpretation of God’s nature. He rejected traditional metaphysical distinctions, emphasizing instead the **transcendence** and **hiddenness of God** as encountered in **revelation** and **faith**, rather than through philosophical speculation about divine attributes. For Bultmann, the language of attributes is meaningful only within the context of God’s self-disclosure in history, particularly in **Jesus Christ**.

- "We cannot speak of God at all except in terms of His acts in history." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- Existence and Faith (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Metaphysical Attributes**
    - Denies the usefulness of classical distinctions between **absolute** and **relative attributes**.
    - Attributes are not abstract qualities but expressions of God’s action in history.
    - Critiques traditional **natural theology** for projecting human concepts onto God.
    - Emphasizes that God’s being is known only in existential encounter.
    - "We cannot objectify God by ascribing to Him qualities in the manner of metaphysics." (Faith and Understanding)

2. **Primacy of Revelation**
    - God’s attributes are disclosed only through **revelation**, not philosophical reasoning.
    - Revelation is eventful, centered in the proclamation of the **kerygma**.
    - The divine is encountered as a personal Thou, not as an object with properties.
    - The meaning of God’s attributes is inseparable from the **Christ event**.
    - "God reveals Himself only in His acts, not in His essence." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Divine Attributes**
    - Attributes describe God’s relationship to human existence, not His essence.
    - Focuses on how God addresses the individual in the moment of faith.
    - The language of attributes is existentially significant, not ontologically descriptive.
    - God’s transcendence is experienced as the call to authentic existence.
    - "God is not an object in the world but the ground of our existence." (Existence and Faith)

4. **Demythologization of Attribute Language**
    - Traditional attribute language is mythological and must be reinterpreted.
    - Demythologization seeks the existential meaning behind biblical descriptions.
    - Absolute and relative attributes are symbols pointing to existential realities.
    - The task is to translate mythological language into existential terms.
    - "Mythological statements must be interpreted existentially to be meaningful today." (New Testament and Mythology)

5. **Christocentric Focus**
    - The definitive revelation of God’s attributes is in **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ’s life, death, and resurrection reveal God’s love, power, and judgment.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative is relativized in the Christ event.
    - Attributes are meaningful only as they are manifest in the encounter with Christ.
    - "In Christ, God’s being and action are one and the same." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **absolute and relative attributes** has profoundly shaped modern theology by challenging the adequacy of metaphysical categories for describing God. His emphasis on **revelation** and existential encounter redirected theological focus from abstract speculation to the lived experience of faith. While controversial, his method of **demythologization** continues to influence discussions on the language of God and the interpretation of divine attributes in contemporary theology. Bultmann’s thought remains a touchstone for debates over the relationship between **biblical revelation** and philosophical theology.
