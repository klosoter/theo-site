# Scott R. Swain (1974–)

Scott R. Swain is a leading contemporary Reformed theologian whose work on the **doctrine of God** emphasizes the classical distinction between **absolute and relative attributes**. Swain upholds the **simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability** of God, while carefully articulating how God's **relations** to the world do not compromise His essential nature. He seeks to retrieve and clarify these categories in service of a robust, confessional **trinitarian theology**.

- "God’s relative attributes are not accidents added to his essence, but are modes of his one simple being as it is ordered to creatures." ("The Trinity: An Introduction")

## Key Works

- "The Trinity: An Introduction" (2020)
- "The God of the Gospel: Robert Jenson’s Trinitarian Theology" (2013)
- "Retrieving Eternal Generation" (co-edited, 2017)
- "Theological Theology: Essays in Honor of John Webster" (contributor, 2015)
- "Divine Simplicity: A Dogmatic Account" (forthcoming)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Absolute Attributes as Essential Perfections**
    - Absolute attributes (e.g., **aseity**, **simplicity**, **immutability**) describe what God is in Himself, apart from creation.
    - These perfections are not contingent upon the world or any relation to it.
    - Swain insists that these attributes are foundational for understanding God’s **transcendence**.
    - He draws on classical sources (Aquinas, Reformed scholastics) to frame these as necessary for a proper doctrine of God.
    - "God is who he is in himself, without reference to anything outside himself." ("The Trinity: An Introduction")

2. **Relative Attributes as Modes of God’s Simple Essence**
    - Relative attributes (e.g., **Creator**, **Redeemer**) express God’s relation to creatures, not a change in His essence.
    - These are not additional properties but describe God’s one essence as it is ordered toward creation.
    - Swain argues that relative attributes safeguard both God’s **immanence** and **immutability**.
    - He maintains that these relations are real, but only on the side of the creature, not in God’s being.
    - "Relative attributes are not accidents in God, but real relations as they are realized in creatures." ("The Trinity: An Introduction")

3. **Divine Simplicity and the Attribute Distinction**
    - Swain affirms that all of God’s attributes are identical with His essence, upholding **divine simplicity**.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is a conceptual, not a real, distinction in God.
    - This commitment guards against any division or composition in God.
    - He uses this doctrine to explain how God can be both transcendent and involved with creation.
    - "All that is in God is God; the distinction of attributes is a distinction of reason, not of reality." ("Divine Simplicity: A Dogmatic Account")

4. **Trinitarian Context of Attribute Distinctions**
    - Swain situates the absolute-relative distinction within the context of **trinitarian relations**.
    - He argues that the **personal properties** of the Father, Son, and Spirit are relative, but not in the same sense as God’s relations to creation.
    - The distinction helps clarify the difference between **immanent** and **economic** Trinity.
    - Swain maintains that the doctrine of the Trinity is the proper context for understanding all divine attributes.
    - "The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is crucial for trinitarian dogmatics." ("The Trinity: An Introduction")

5. **Retrieval of Classical Categories for Contemporary Theology**
    - Swain advocates for the retrieval of classical distinctions to address modern theological confusion.
    - He contends that abandoning these categories leads to misunderstandings about God’s relation to the world.
    - Swain’s work is marked by a constructive engagement with both historical and contemporary sources.
    - He seeks to show the ongoing relevance of **Reformed scholasticism** for systematic theology today.
    - "The classical distinction between absolute and relative attributes remains indispensable for Christian theology." ("The Trinity: An Introduction")

## Legacy and Impact

Scott R. Swain has played a significant role in the contemporary retrieval of **classical theism** within Reformed theology, especially regarding the doctrine of God’s attributes. His careful articulation of the **absolute and relative attributes** has influenced both academic and ecclesial discussions, helping to clarify the relationship between God’s transcendence and immanence. Swain’s work continues to shape systematic theology by grounding it in confessional and classical categories, ensuring their relevance for the church’s doctrine and worship.
