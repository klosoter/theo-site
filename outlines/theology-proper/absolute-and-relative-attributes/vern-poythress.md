# Vern Poythress (1946–)

Vern Poythress approaches the distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** within the framework of **Trinitarian theology** and a **multiperspectival** method. He emphasizes that all of God's attributes are fully integrated in the divine being, rejecting any strict separation between God's **aseity** and His **relations to creation**. Poythress seeks to uphold both the **immutability** and **personal involvement** of God, insisting that classical distinctions must be interpreted through the lens of **biblical revelation** and the **Trinity**.

- "God’s attributes are not separable parts, but different perspectives on the fullness of who God is." (Theology of Lordship: The Lordship of Christ)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Attributes as Perspectives**
    - Attributes are not isolated components but perspectives on the one, unified God.
    - The distinction between **absolute** (God-in-Himself) and **relative** (God-in-relation) attributes is a tool for understanding, not a division in God.
    - All attributes are fully present in all of God's actions and relations.
    - Multiperspectivalism resists any fragmentation of the divine nature.
    - "Each attribute is a perspective on the whole of God’s character." (Symphonic Theology)

2. **Trinitarian Foundation**
    - The doctrine of the **Trinity** is foundational for understanding all divine attributes.
    - The persons of the Trinity relate to each other eternally, grounding both absolute and relative aspects.
    - God's relationality is not contingent on creation but is intrinsic to His triune being.
    - The unity and diversity in God’s attributes reflect the unity and diversity of the Trinity.
    - "The Trinity provides the ultimate context for understanding God’s attributes." (The Lordship of Christ)

3. **Biblical Revelation as Normative**
    - Scripture, not philosophical abstraction, is the ultimate authority for understanding God’s attributes.
    - Biblical language often intertwines so-called absolute and relative attributes.
    - The Bible presents God as both transcendent and immanent, without contradiction.
    - Theological distinctions must serve, not override, the biblical witness.
    - "We must let the Bible itself guide our understanding of God’s attributes." (Redeeming Philosophy)

4. **Divine Immutability and Relationality**
    - God is **immutable** in His being and character, yet genuinely relates to creation.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes must not compromise either God’s changelessness or His engagement.
    - God’s relational actions are expressions of His eternal purposes, not changes in His essence.
    - The classical distinction is helpful only if it preserves both aspects.
    - "God’s immutability and His relationality are not in tension but are harmonized in His lordship." (The Lordship of Christ)

5. **Critique of Overly Rigid Distinctions**
    - Overly rigid separation of attributes risks distorting the biblical picture of God.
    - The absolute-relative distinction is a human tool, not a metaphysical boundary in God.
    - Theological language must be analogical and humble before the mystery of God.
    - Multiperspectivalism encourages flexibility and faithfulness to Scripture.
    - "We must beware of imposing our own categories too rigidly on the mystery of God." (Symphonic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s **multiperspectival** approach has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by challenging rigid classical categories and emphasizing the integration of all divine attributes. His work encourages theologians to ground their understanding of God in **Trinitarian** and **biblical** revelation, rather than in philosophical abstraction. Poythress’s contributions have fostered a more dynamic and relational vision of God, while still upholding the classical commitments of **immutability** and **aseity**. His writings continue to shape discussions on the nature of God’s attributes in evangelical and Reformed circles.
