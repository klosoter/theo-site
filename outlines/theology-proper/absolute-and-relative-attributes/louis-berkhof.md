# Louis Berkhof (1873–1957)

Louis Berkhof, a leading figure in **Reformed dogmatics**, distinguished between the **absolute** and **relative attributes** of God to clarify how God’s being relates both to Himself and to creation. He maintained that the **absolute attributes** (such as **immutability** and **infinity**) describe God as He is in Himself, while the **relative attributes** (such as **omnipresence** and **omniscience**) express His relationship to the world. This distinction serves to uphold both the **transcendence** and **immanence** of God in classical theism.

- "The absolute or incommunicable attributes are those which belong to the essence of God as considered in itself, while the relative or communicable attributes are those which are revealed in relation to the world." (Systematic Theology)

- Manual of Christian Doctrine
- Introductory Volume to Systematic Theology
- The History of Christian Doctrines

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Attributes as Incommunicable**
    - Absolute attributes are those which belong to God alone and cannot be shared with creatures.
    - Examples include **independence**, **immutability**, and **infinity**.
    - These attributes highlight the **transcendence** and uniqueness of God.
    - They are foundational for understanding God’s self-existence and perfection.
    - "They emphasize the absolute distinction between the Creator and the creature." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Relative Attributes as Communicable**
    - Relative attributes are those which God reveals in relation to His creation.
    - These include **knowledge**, **wisdom**, **goodness**, and **love**.
    - They are termed "communicable" because they are reflected, in a finite way, in humans.
    - This category supports the **immanence** of God and His covenantal dealings.
    - "The communicable attributes are those to which some analogy is found in man." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Purpose of the Distinction**
    - The distinction serves to safeguard both God’s **otherness** and His nearness.
    - It prevents the confusion of God’s essence with His works.
    - It aids in systematic theology by providing clarity in the doctrine of God.
    - The distinction is pedagogical, not ontological, avoiding division within God’s simplicity.
    - "This distinction is not absolute, but serves as a didactic tool." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Unity and Simplicity of God**
    - Despite the distinction, God’s attributes are not separate parts of His being.
    - All attributes are identical with God’s essence and with each other in God.
    - The distinction is a human way of understanding the fullness of God’s nature.
    - God’s **simplicity** means He is not composed of parts or qualities.
    - "In God, all the attributes are identical with His essence." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Reformed Emphasis on Divine Sovereignty**
    - The distinction upholds the **sovereignty** and majesty of God.
    - It ensures that God’s relationship to creation does not compromise His independence.
    - The Reformed tradition stresses both the transcendence and covenantal nearness of God.
    - Berkhof’s approach is rooted in classic Reformed confessions and scholasticism.
    - "The Reformed faith maintains both the transcendence and immanence of God." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkhof’s articulation of the **absolute and relative attributes** has become a standard reference in Reformed theology, shaping generations of pastors and theologians. His clear, systematic presentation has influenced the teaching of **divine attributes** in seminaries and churches worldwide. By maintaining the balance between God’s transcendence and immanence, Berkhof’s work continues to provide a robust framework for understanding the doctrine of God in the Reformed tradition.
