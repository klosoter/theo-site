# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer critically engaged the traditional distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** of God, questioning its theological utility and emphasizing the unity of the divine being. He argued that dividing God's attributes into **absolute** (those belonging to God in himself) and **relative** (those in relation to creation) risks fragmenting the **simplicity** and **revelational coherence** of God's self-disclosure. Berkouwer insisted that all divine attributes are revealed in the context of God's relationship with the world, and thus should be understood within the framework of **revelation** and **covenant**.

- "The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is not a neutral one, but is itself a theological decision with far-reaching consequences." (The Providence of God)

## Key Works

- The Providence of God
- The Knowledge of God
- Studies in Dogmatics: The Doctrine of God
- General Revelation
- Holy Scripture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Critique of the Absolute/Relative Distinction**
    - Argues that the distinction is not grounded in **biblical revelation** but in philosophical speculation.
    - Warns that it can lead to a **dualism** within the doctrine of God.
    - Emphasizes that all attributes are revealed in the context of God's **redemptive activity**.
    - Sees the distinction as potentially undermining the **unity** of God's being.
    - "The separation of absolute and relative attributes threatens to obscure the unity of God's revelation." (The Providence of God)

2. **Unity and Simplicity of God**
    - Stresses the **simplicity** of God, rejecting any division within the divine essence.
    - Maintains that all attributes are fully present in every act of God.
    - Attributes are not parts of God, but ways in which the one God is revealed.
    - The unity of God is a **confessional** and **biblical** starting point.
    - "God is not a composite of attributes, but the living God who reveals Himself wholly in every attribute." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Revelational Context of Attributes**
    - Attributes must be understood as revealed in **history** and **covenant**.
    - Rejects abstract speculation apart from **God’s self-revelation**.
    - The knowledge of God is always **personal** and **relational**.
    - Attributes are not static qualities but dynamic revelations of God’s being.
    - "We know God only as He reveals Himself, and this revelation is always relational." (The Knowledge of God)

4. **Critique of Philosophical Theism**
    - Warns against importing **philosophical categories** into theology.
    - Sees the absolute/relative distinction as rooted in **Greek metaphysics** rather than Scripture.
    - Urges a return to the **biblical witness** as the norm for speaking of God.
    - Theology must resist the temptation to systematize God beyond what is revealed.
    - "Theology must not be led by philosophical abstractions, but by the concrete revelation of God." (The Providence of God)

5. **Christological Focus in the Doctrine of God**
    - Christ is the center of God’s **self-revelation** and the key to understanding divine attributes.
    - In Christ, the so-called absolute and relative attributes are united and revealed.
    - The incarnation demonstrates the **unity** of God’s transcendence and immanence.
    - Theological reflection on attributes must be shaped by the reality of **Jesus Christ**.
    - "In Christ, the fullness of God’s attributes is made known in redemptive history." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s critique of the **absolute and relative attributes** distinction has influenced contemporary Reformed theology, encouraging a more biblically grounded and unified approach to the doctrine of God. His emphasis on **revelation** and the centrality of Christ has redirected theological reflection away from speculative metaphysics toward the concrete realities of redemptive history. Berkouwer’s work continues to challenge theologians to maintain the **unity** and **simplicity** of God while remaining faithful to the scriptural witness.
