# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann reinterprets the **absolute and relative attributes** of God through a robustly **Trinitarian theology** and a focus on the **theology of the cross**. He challenges classical theism’s separation of God’s **immutability** and **impassibility** (absolute attributes) from God’s relational engagement with creation (relative attributes), arguing that God’s being is dynamically involved in history, especially through **suffering** and **hope**.

- "God is not greater than he is in humiliation. God is not more glorious than he is in the cross." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- God in Creation (1985)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redefinition of Divine Immutability**
    - Rejects classical notions of **immutability** as static or unchangeable.
    - Argues that God’s immutability is consistent with God’s capacity to suffer and change in relation to creation.
    - Emphasizes that God’s faithfulness, not metaphysical immobility, is the true meaning of immutability.
    - Sees the cross as the ultimate revelation of God’s openness to change.
    - "God does not become greater by being invulnerable, but by being vulnerable." (The Crucified God)

2. **Trinitarian Relationality**
    - Grounds God’s attributes in the **perichoretic** relations of Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - Asserts that God’s being is inherently relational, not solitary.
    - The **Trinity** models both God’s transcendence (absolute) and immanence (relative).
    - Divine attributes are expressed in the mutual love and suffering of the persons.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the social doctrine of God." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

3. **Divine Suffering and Compassion**
    - God’s **impassibility** is reinterpreted as the capacity to suffer out of love.
    - The cross reveals God’s willingness to enter into the suffering of creation.
    - Divine compassion is not a limitation but the fullness of God’s love.
    - God’s suffering is voluntary and redemptive, not imposed.
    - "A God who cannot suffer is poorer than any man." (The Crucified God)

4. **Eschatological Dynamism**
    - God’s attributes are oriented toward the **future** and the fulfillment of creation.
    - The **relative attributes** (e.g., mercy, patience) are not secondary but essential to God’s being.
    - God’s promises and actions in history reveal the dynamic character of the divine nature.
    - The absolute and relative attributes converge in God’s eschatological purposes.
    - "God is as he will be: the future of God determines his being." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Critique of Classical Theism**
    - Challenges the Hellenistic roots of the absolute-relative distinction.
    - Argues that classical theism’s emphasis on **aseity** and **impassibility** obscures the biblical witness.
    - Proposes a **theology of the cross** as corrective, centering on God’s self-revelation in suffering.
    - Sees the absolute-relative schema as inadequate for **Trinitarian** and Christological reflection.
    - "The God who is love is not the unmoved mover but the one who is moved and who moves." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s reconfiguration of the **absolute and relative attributes** has profoundly influenced contemporary **Trinitarian theology** and the doctrine of God. His emphasis on divine suffering and relationality has challenged traditional metaphysical categories and inspired new approaches to **theodicy**, **eschatology**, and **social theology**. Moltmann’s work continues to provoke debate about the nature of God’s involvement in history and the meaning of divine perfection.
