# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas distinguished between **absolute** and **relative attributes** in his doctrine of God, emphasizing that God's **essence** is identical with His attributes, yet these can be considered from different perspectives. **Absolute attributes** (such as goodness, wisdom, and power) describe what God is in Himself, while **relative attributes** (such as Creator or Lord) express God's relation to creation. This distinction safeguards both the **simplicity** and **immutability** of God while allowing for meaningful discourse about His actions in the world.

- "All the names that are predicated of God absolutely signify the divine essence, but those that are said of Him relatively signify, not the essence, but the relation." (Summa Theologiae I, q.13, a.7)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I, qq. 3, 13
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book I
- De Potentia Dei
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- The Oxford Handbook of Aquinas (ed. Davies & Stump)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity**
   - God is not composed of parts; His **essence** and **attributes** are identical.
   - No real distinction exists between God's attributes in God Himself.
   - The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is conceptual, not ontological.
   - Simplicity ensures that God is not subject to change or division.
   - "In God, essence and existence are the same, and so are all His attributes." (Summa Theologiae I, q.3, a.4)

2. **Absolute Attributes as Essential**
   - Absolute attributes describe what God is in Himself, apart from creation.
   - Examples include **goodness**, **wisdom**, **omnipotence**, and **eternity**.
   - These attributes are grounded in God's essence and are not dependent on anything external.
   - They are predicated of God in a way that affirms His transcendence and perfection.
   - "Names which signify the divine essence in itself are predicated of God absolutely." (Summa Theologiae I, q.13, a.7)

3. **Relative Attributes as Relational**
   - Relative attributes refer to God's relationship to creatures (e.g., Creator, Lord).
   - These do not signify God's essence directly but His relation to the world.
   - Such relations are real in creatures but only conceptually in God.
   - Relative attributes do not introduce composition or change in God.
   - "Relative names do not signify the essence directly, but the relation to creatures." (Summa Theologiae I, q.13, a.7)

4. **Analogical Predication**
   - Human language about God is **analogical**, not univocal or purely equivocal.
   - Both absolute and relative attributes are predicated analogically of God.
   - This preserves the mystery of divine transcendence while enabling true knowledge of God.
   - Analogical predication avoids anthropomorphism and agnosticism.
   - "We cannot know what God is, but only what He is not; we must therefore consider the ways in which God does not resemble His creatures." (Summa Contra Gentiles I, 30)

5. **Immutability and Eternity**
   - God’s absolute attributes affirm His **immutability** and **eternity**.
   - Relative attributes do not imply any change or temporal succession in God.
   - God’s relations to the world are grounded in His eternal will and knowledge.
   - This commitment upholds the Creator-creature distinction and divine transcendence.
   - "God is altogether immutable, and His relations to creatures do not affect His essence." (Summa Theologiae I, q.9, a.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** became foundational for later **Scholastic** and **Reformed** theology, shaping discussions of divine simplicity and the Creator-creature relationship. His careful articulation preserved both the transcendence and immanence of God, influencing major confessional traditions. The conceptual clarity he brought to the language of divine attributes remains a touchstone for systematic theology and philosophical reflection on the doctrine of God.
