# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin carefully distinguished between the **absolute** and **relative attributes** of God to safeguard both the **simplicity** and **immutability** of the divine essence. He argued that while God's **absolute attributes** (such as **aseity** and **infinity**) pertain to his essence in itself, his **relative attributes** (such as **justice** and **mercy**) describe God's relation to creatures, yet both are ultimately one in God. This distinction was central to Turretin's defense of classical **Reformed theism**.

- "The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is not a distinction in God himself, but in our manner of conceiving him." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, III.5.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Third Topic, Questions 5–6)
- Synopsis of Purer Theology (as contributor)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)
- The Doctrine of God (secondary: Richard A. Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction is Logical, Not Real**
    - The difference between **absolute** and **relative attributes** exists only in human conception, not in God himself.
    - God's essence remains **simple** and undivided despite our multiple attributions.
    - The distinction helps clarify scriptural language about God without implying composition.
    - All attributes are identical with the divine essence, differing only in their relation to creatures or our understanding.
    - "There is no real distinction in God, but only a virtual or logical one." (Institutes, III.5.6)

2. **Absolute Attributes Define God in Himself**
    - **Absolute attributes** (e.g., **eternity**, **immutability**, **infinity**) pertain to God's being apart from creation.
    - These attributes are foundational and necessary to the divine essence.
    - They are not dependent on any relation to the world or creatures.
    - Turretin uses these to defend the **aseity** and **self-sufficiency** of God.
    - "Absolute attributes are those which belong to God considered in himself, without respect to creatures." (Institutes, III.5.6)

3. **Relative Attributes Express Divine Relations**
    - **Relative attributes** (e.g., **Creator**, **Lord**, **Redeemer**) describe God as he relates to creation.
    - These do not imply any change or composition in God.
    - Relative attributes are grounded in the absolute, but are revealed through God's works ad extra.
    - They are necessary for understanding **revelation** and the economy of salvation.
    - "Relative attributes are those which express a relation to creatures, not a change in God." (Institutes, III.5.6)

4. **Safeguarding Divine Simplicity**
    - The distinction upholds the **simplicity** of God by denying any real division in his being.
    - Turretin rejects any notion that attributes are parts or separate realities in God.
    - All perfections are one in the divine essence, differing only in our conception.
    - This commitment guards against both **tritheism** and **modalism**.
    - "All the attributes are really one and the same in God, differing only in our manner of conceiving." (Institutes, III.5.7)

5. **Theological Utility of the Distinction**
    - The distinction aids in interpreting **Scripture** and articulating **orthodox doctrine**.
    - It helps explain how God can be both transcendent and immanent.
    - The framework assists in responding to heresies that compromise divine unity or immutability.
    - It provides clarity for systematic theology and catechesis.
    - "This distinction is useful for the clearer understanding of the divine perfections and their harmony." (Institutes, III.5.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin's nuanced articulation of the **absolute and relative attributes** became a standard reference in **Reformed scholasticism** and influenced later systematic theology, especially through his Institutes. His careful distinctions helped preserve the classical doctrine of **divine simplicity** while allowing for robust engagement with biblical revelation. Turretin's approach continues to shape contemporary discussions of the doctrine of God within confessional Reformed circles.
