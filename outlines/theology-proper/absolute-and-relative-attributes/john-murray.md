# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in twentieth-century **Reformed theology**, approached the doctrine of God’s **attributes** with careful attention to the classical distinctions between **absolute and relative attributes**. He emphasized the unity and simplicity of God, warning against any division that would compromise the **aseity** and **immutability** of the divine nature. Murray’s treatment reflects a commitment to the historic **Westminster Confession** while engaging critically with modern theological trends.

- "We must not think of the attributes of God as so many parts or properties which are added together to make up the divine essence." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Nature and Attributes of God" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- Principles of Conduct (especially introductory chapters)
- "Systematic Theology" lectures (Westminster Theological Seminary archives)
- The Epistle to the Romans (theological excursuses)
- The Westminster Confession of Faith: A Commentary

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Simplicity and Unity**
    - God’s **attributes** are not separable parts but identical with His essence.
    - The distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** is an analytical tool, not an ontological division.
    - All attributes are fully present in every act of God.
    - Simplicity safeguards the **aseity** and **immutability** of God.
    - "The attributes are not superadded to the being of God but are identical with it." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Absolute Attributes as Essential Perfections**
    - **Absolute attributes** (e.g., eternity, immutability, infinity) pertain to God’s being in Himself.
    - These attributes are not conditioned by creation or history.
    - They express the transcendence and self-existence of God.
    - Murray insists these are foundational for understanding God’s **holiness** and **sovereignty**.
    - "God is who He is in Himself, apart from all relation to the created order." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Relative Attributes as Revelatory**
    - **Relative attributes** (e.g., mercy, justice, faithfulness) describe God’s relation to creation.
    - These are not new qualities but expressions of the one divine essence in relation to creatures.
    - The distinction is rooted in revelation, not in God’s being.
    - Relative attributes manifest the absolute perfections in redemptive history.
    - "The so-called relative attributes are simply the absolute attributes viewed in relation to the created order." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Guarding Against Anthropomorphism**
    - Murray cautions against projecting human categories onto God’s attributes.
    - The distinction must not compromise divine **transcendence**.
    - Both absolute and relative attributes are analogical, not univocal.
    - Theological language must preserve the mystery of the divine nature.
    - "We must beware of thinking of God’s attributes in terms of human faculties or qualities." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Confessional and Scriptural Fidelity**
    - Murray grounds his doctrine in the **Westminster Confession** and the witness of Scripture.
    - He affirms the classical Reformed tradition while engaging contemporary challenges.
    - The distinction serves to clarify, not to divide, the unity of God.
    - Scripture reveals both the transcendence and immanence of God through His attributes.
    - "The distinction is not intended to divide the being of God but to assist us in understanding the fullness of his revelation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of the **absolute and relative attributes** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the doctrine of God. His insistence on **divine simplicity** and the unity of the divine essence remains influential among confessional theologians. By rooting his theology in both Scripture and the Westminster standards, Murray provided a model for doctrinal fidelity and constructive engagement with modern issues. His legacy endures in the ongoing retrieval of classical theism within Reformed circles.
