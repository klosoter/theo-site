# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the doctrine of **divine attributes** by grounding them in the structure of **God-consciousness** and the feeling of absolute dependence. He rejected traditional distinctions between **absolute and relative attributes**, arguing that all attributes must be understood in relation to the religious experience of the community. For Schleiermacher, the attributes of God are not abstract metaphysical properties but expressions of the divine as encountered in **Christian piety**.

- "All attributes are only different aspects of the same relation of God to the world and of the world to God." (The Christian Faith, §50)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Traditional Attribute Distinctions**
   - Denies the metaphysical separation of **absolute** (e.g., simplicity, immutability) and **relative** (e.g., omnipresence, omniscience) attributes.
   - Attributes are not properties in God but modes of relation to the world as experienced in **God-consciousness**.
   - The distinction is seen as speculative and disconnected from living faith.
   - Attributes must be derived from the self-consciousness of the Christian community.
   - "The distinction between absolute and relative attributes is not grounded in the essence of God, but in the way we experience God." (The Christian Faith, §50)

2. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
   - All knowledge of God’s attributes arises from the feeling of **absolute dependence**.
   - Attributes are expressions of the divine as mediated through **piety**.
   - Theological reflection must begin with the lived experience of the church.
   - The attributes are not speculative but practical, shaping the life of faith.
   - "We know nothing of God except what is given in the feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith, §4)

3. **Unity of Divine Attributes**
   - Attributes are unified in the divine essence as experienced, not as separate qualities.
   - God’s attributes are inseparable from the divine relation to the world.
   - The unity of attributes reflects the unity of religious consciousness.
   - Any division among attributes is a product of human abstraction, not divine reality.
   - "All distinctions of attributes are only distinctions in our way of regarding the one God." (The Christian Faith, §50)

4. **God as the Whence of Dependence**
   - God is known as the source (whence) of the feeling of dependence, not as an object with definable properties.
   - Attributes describe how God is present to human consciousness, not what God is in se.
   - The focus is on God’s relation to the world, not on metaphysical speculation.
   - The divine is always transcendent to human conceptualization.
   - "God is for us only as the Whence of our feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith, §4)

5. **Christocentric Mediation of Attributes**
   - The person of **Christ** is the concrete locus for understanding divine attributes.
   - Christ mediates the experience of God’s attributes to the community.
   - The attributes are most fully revealed in the historical life of Jesus.
   - The church’s experience of Christ shapes its understanding of God’s nature.
   - "In Christ, the attributes of God are made manifest to the religious consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §93)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **divine attributes** profoundly influenced modern theology by shifting the focus from metaphysical speculation to the dynamics of **religious experience**. His rejection of the absolute-relative distinction paved the way for existential and phenomenological approaches to God’s nature. While criticized by confessional theologians for subjectivism, his emphasis on the unity of attributes and the centrality of **Christ** remains a touchstone for liberal Protestant thought. Schleiermacher’s legacy endures in contemporary discussions of how divine attributes are known and articulated within the life of the church.
