# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth reinterpreted the classical distinction between **absolute and relative attributes** by insisting that all of God's attributes are revealed and actualized in His **self-revelation in Jesus Christ**. For Barth, God's attributes are not abstract qualities but are dynamically expressed in the history of salvation, particularly in the event of **revelation** and **reconciliation**. He rejected any separation between God's being and His acts, emphasizing the unity and actuality of the divine attributes.

- "God’s being is in His act and His act is in His being." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of God’s Attributes**
    - Barth rejects the classical division of **absolute** (immanent) and **relative** (transitive) attributes.
    - All attributes are unified in the one act of God’s self-revelation.
    - God’s attributes are not abstract qualities but are known only in His concrete actions.
    - The distinction is subordinated to the reality of God’s self-disclosure in Christ.
    - "God is who He is in the act of His revelation." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

2. **Revelation as the Basis for Knowledge of Attributes**
    - True knowledge of God’s attributes comes only through **revelation**.
    - God’s attributes are not accessible through natural theology or philosophical speculation.
    - The event of revelation in Jesus Christ is the sole source for understanding God’s nature.
    - Barth insists that God’s attributes are personal and relational, not abstract.
    - "We must learn from God Himself who He is." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

3. **Actuality of Divine Attributes**
    - God’s attributes are not static but are actualized in His free, sovereign action.
    - The being of God is identical with His act; there is no hidden God behind His revelation.
    - The so-called “absolute” attributes are always expressed in God’s relationship to the world.
    - God’s love, holiness, and freedom are all revealed in His dealings with humanity.
    - "God lives and acts as the One He is." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

4. **Christocentric Focus**
    - All divine attributes are interpreted through the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - The incarnation is the definitive manifestation of both God’s transcendence and immanence.
    - The distinction between absolute and relative is overcome in the unity of Christ’s person.
    - God’s attributes are not divided between what He is in Himself and what He is for us.
    - "In Jesus Christ, God reveals Himself as both the One who is exalted and the One who is lowly." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

5. **Critique of Classical Theism**
    - Barth critiques the traditional metaphysical approach to divine attributes.
    - He warns against projecting human concepts onto God’s being.
    - The absolute-relative distinction, if abstracted from revelation, leads to a “God behind God.”
    - Barth insists on the priority of God’s self-interpretation over philosophical categories.
    - "We must not seek a God behind the God who reveals Himself." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s reconfiguration of the **doctrine of God** challenged both Protestant and Catholic traditions to reconsider the meaning and function of divine attributes. His emphasis on **revelation** and the unity of God’s being and act has shaped modern theology’s approach to the classical distinctions of **absolute and relative attributes**. Barth’s thought continues to provoke debate about the relationship between God’s transcendence and immanence, and his Christocentric method remains influential in contemporary systematic theology.
