# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther approached the **attributes of God** with a focus on the distinction between the **Deus absconditus** (hidden God) and **Deus revelatus** (revealed God), rather than a strict scholastic division between **absolute and relative attributes**. For Luther, God's **majesty** and **mercy** are known only through **revelation in Christ**, and human speculation about God's essence apart from revelation leads to error. He emphasized the limits of human reason in comprehending God's **absolute attributes**, insisting that true knowledge of God is mediated through the **cross**.

- "We must know God as He makes Himself known, not as He is in His incomprehensible majesty." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 20)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Hiddenness and Revelation**
    - God’s **absolute attributes** are ultimately unknowable apart from His self-revelation.
    - The distinction between **Deus absconditus** and **Deus revelatus** supersedes scholastic categories.
    - Human attempts to grasp God’s essence apart from Christ lead to despair or presumption.
    - God’s **relative attributes** are disclosed in the economy of salvation, especially in Christ.
    - "God in His own nature and majesty is to be left alone; in this regard, we have nothing to do with Him." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Christocentric Knowledge of God**
    - All true knowledge of God’s attributes is mediated through **Jesus Christ**.
    - The cross reveals both God’s justice and mercy, uniting attributes often separated in scholastic theology.
    - The **absolute attributes** are not accessible except as they are revealed in Christ’s person and work.
    - The believer encounters God’s attributes as promises, not abstract qualities.
    - "He who would know God, let him look into the manger and the cross." (Table Talk)

3. **Critique of Scholastic Distinctions**
    - Luther rejected speculative distinctions between **absolute** and **relative attributes** as unbiblical.
    - He saw such distinctions as products of fallen human reason, not of faith.
    - Theological language must serve proclamation, not metaphysical speculation.
    - God’s attributes are not to be dissected apart from His saving acts.
    - "Away with all such speculations about the divine majesty!" (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Sola Scriptura and the Attributes of God**
    - Scripture alone is the norm for speaking of God’s attributes.
    - The biblical narrative, not philosophical abstraction, determines how God is known.
    - God’s attributes are revealed in His acts in history, especially in Christ.
    - The **Word of God** is the only safe ground for theology.
    - "Let us not climb up to heaven to see what God is in Himself, but hold to what He has revealed in His Word." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Pastoral Implications of God’s Attributes**
    - The distinction between hidden and revealed God is crucial for comfort and assurance.
    - Speculation about God’s absolute attributes can lead to terror or despair.
    - Faith clings to God’s promises as revealed, not to His inscrutable majesty.
    - The believer is called to trust God as He is for us in Christ, not as He is in Himself.
    - "We must stay with the God clothed in His Word and works, not with the naked God." (Heidelberg Disputation)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s approach to the **attributes of God** profoundly shaped Protestant theology by prioritizing **revelation in Christ** over metaphysical speculation. His distinction between the hidden and revealed God redirected theological focus from abstract attributes to the concrete promises of the gospel. This emphasis on the **cross** and the limits of human reason continues to influence Lutheran and broader Reformation thought, challenging later theologians to ground their doctrine of God in **Scripture** and the person of Christ.
