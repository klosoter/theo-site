# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity affirm the **existence and knowability of God** as foundational to the Reformed faith. They teach that God is known through both **general revelation** in creation and **special revelation** in Scripture, while also emphasizing the limits of human knowledge due to sin and the necessity of **faith** for true knowledge of God.

- "We know Him by two means: first, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe... second, He makes Himself more clearly and fully known to us by His holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 1–3
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 19–21, 26
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. First Head, Article 4
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Beeke & Ferguson)
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. Dennison)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Self-Evident and Revealed**
    - God’s existence is manifest in the order and beauty of creation.
    - The human conscience testifies to the reality of God.
    - The Belgic Confession asserts that God is "eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, immutable."
    - Knowledge of God is not constructed by man but revealed by God Himself.
    - "We know Him by two means: first, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe..." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

2. **General Revelation is Sufficient for Accountability**
    - Creation, preservation, and providence reveal God’s power and divinity.
    - All people are left without excuse before God due to this revelation.
    - General revelation is not sufficient for salvation but sufficient to know God exists.
    - The clarity of general revelation is affirmed, though it is suppressed by sinful humanity.
    - "All these things are before our eyes as so many characters leading us to see clearly the invisible things of God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

3. **Special Revelation is Necessary for Saving Knowledge**
    - The Scriptures are the only sufficient, certain, and infallible source for knowing God’s will and the way of salvation.
    - Special revelation clarifies what is obscure in general revelation.
    - The Word of God is necessary due to the darkness of human understanding after the Fall.
    - The Holy Spirit illumines the heart to receive and understand Scripture.
    - "He makes Himself more clearly and fully known to us by His holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Art. 2)

4. **God is Incomprehensible but Knowable**
    - God’s essence cannot be fully comprehended by finite creatures.
    - True knowledge of God is possible, though always partial and analogical.
    - The confessions stress humility before the mystery of God’s being.
    - Knowledge of God is relational and covenantal, not merely speculative.
    - "We know Him in so far as He makes Himself known to us." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

5. **Faith is the Means of True Knowledge**
    - Saving knowledge of God comes through faith worked by the Holy Spirit.
    - Faith receives and trusts the revelation of God in Christ and Scripture.
    - The Heidelberg Catechism emphasizes knowledge, assent, and trust as elements of faith.
    - Faith is not blind but rests on God’s self-attestation in Word and Spirit.
    - "True faith is not only a certain knowledge... but also a hearty trust." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 21)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have shaped the **Reformed doctrine of revelation**, establishing a clear distinction between **general and special revelation** and articulating the necessity of faith for true knowledge of God. Their confessional formulations have influenced Reformed theology globally, providing a doctrinal standard for churches and theological education. The emphasis on both the accessibility and the mystery of God remains central in contemporary Reformed thought.
