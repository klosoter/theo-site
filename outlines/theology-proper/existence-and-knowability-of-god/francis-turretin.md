# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin robustly defended the **existence** and **knowability of God** within the framework of **Reformed scholasticism**. He argued that while God's **essence** is incomprehensible to finite minds, true knowledge of God is possible through **natural revelation** and is perfected by **supernatural revelation** in Scripture. Turretin maintained that reason, though affected by the Fall, retains the capacity to recognize God's existence, but saving knowledge comes only through **special revelation**.

- "Although the knowledge of God, as to the mode, is obscure and imperfect in this life, yet as to the thing itself, it is true and saving." ("Institutes of Elenctic Theology," 1.2.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Questions 3–10)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected writings in Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (ed. Richard Muller)
- The Doctrine of Scripture (secondary: John Frame, "The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Rationally Demonstrable**
   - Affirms that the **existence of God** can be known by reason through the created order.
   - Employs **classical theistic arguments** (cosmological, teleological) as valid proofs.
   - Rejects skepticism regarding the possibility of natural knowledge of God.
   - Distinguishes between knowledge of God’s existence and knowledge of His essence.
   - "The existence of God is not only believed by faith, but also known by reason." (Institutes, 1.3.4)

2. **Natural Revelation is Sufficient for Knowledge of God’s Existence**
   - Creation reveals God’s **eternal power and divinity** to all people.
   - The **light of nature** provides an inescapable testimony to God’s existence.
   - Even after the Fall, remnants of this knowledge persist in all humanity.
   - This knowledge is sufficient for condemnation but not for salvation.
   - "The knowledge of God from nature is sufficient to render men inexcusable." (Institutes, 1.3.7)

3. **Supernatural Revelation Perfects and Corrects Natural Knowledge**
   - **Scripture** is necessary for a saving and fuller knowledge of God.
   - Supernatural revelation clarifies truths obscured by sin and finitude.
   - The **Trinity** and God’s redemptive purposes are known only through revelation.
   - Faith is grounded in the authority of God speaking in Scripture.
   - "Supernatural revelation is necessary for the knowledge of those things which pertain to salvation." (Institutes, 1.2.8)

4. **God’s Essence is Incomprehensible, Yet Truly Knowable**
   - God’s **infinite essence** cannot be comprehended by finite minds.
   - True knowledge is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
   - We know God truly, though not exhaustively, through His **attributes** and works.
   - The distinction between **archetypal** and **ectypal theology** safeguards both transcendence and knowability.
   - "We know God not as he is in himself, but as he is revealed to us." (Institutes, 1.2.5)

5. **Faith and Reason are Distinct but Harmonious**
   - Faith presupposes, but also transcends, the deliverances of reason.
   - Reason can demonstrate God’s existence, but faith apprehends God as revealed in Christ.
   - There is no contradiction between **natural theology** and **revealed theology**.
   - Both faculties are gifts of God, ordered to His glory.
   - "Faith does not destroy reason, but perfects it." (Institutes, 1.8.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of the **existence and knowability of God** shaped the trajectory of Reformed orthodoxy and influenced later theologians, including at Westminster Theological Seminary. His careful distinctions between **natural and supernatural revelation** and between the knowability and incomprehensibility of God remain foundational in Reformed dogmatics. Turretin’s synthesis of scholastic method and confessional fidelity continues to inform debates on **theological epistemology** and the relationship between faith and reason.
