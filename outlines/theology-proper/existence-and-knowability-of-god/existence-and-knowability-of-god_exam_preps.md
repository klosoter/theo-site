### TITLE
Knowing the Incomprehensible God: Classical Theism, Revelation, and the Conditions of True Knowledge

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How the **existence** of the transcendent, simple, triune God can be affirmed and how such a God can be **truly yet analogically known** by finite creatures.
- Decisive figures: Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Francis Turretin, Karl Barth, Alvin Plantinga.
- Traditions: Patristic and medieval **classical theism**, Reformed orthodoxy and **Reformed epistemology**, dialectical and modern Protestant theology, analytic philosophy of religion.

- Defended position: The triune God’s **existence** is knowable by both **natural and supernatural revelation**, and while God is **incomprehensible**, humans possess true, covenantally conditioned, **analogical knowledge** of him grounded in God’s self-revelation and authenticated by the internal work of the Spirit.

### ESSAY
The topic of the existence and knowability of God forces a candidate to hold together two controlling convictions of classical Reformed theology: on the one hand, that the God confessed in Scripture really is the utterly transcendent and **incomprehensible** Lord who dwells in unapproachable light; on the other hand, that this same God is truly, though never exhaustively, known through his **revelation** in creation and in Christ as attested in Scripture. Examiners will press whether these two convictions collapse either into an idol of human conceptual projection or into a mysticism that leaves us with no doctrinally articulable God. The task is to defend the claim that the triune God both exists and can be known, by insisting that his self-revelation is the principium cognoscendi of theology, while also acknowledging a real yet subordinate place for **natural knowledge of God** and for rigorous philosophical defense of theism.

To clarify the problem, we must distinguish several levels. First, the metaphysical question: does there exist a **necessary, simple, eternal, personal creator** distinct from the world. Second, the epistemological question: if such a God exists, by what means and in what mode can he be known by finite, fallen creatures. Third, the noetic and covenantal question: how do sin and grace structure both the failure and the healing of our knowledge of God. Scripture and classical Christian theology answer all three at once. Romans 1 affirms both that God’s **eternal power and divine nature** are clearly perceived through the things that have been made and that human beings in unrighteousness suppress this knowledge. John 1 and Hebrews 1 then locate saving knowledge of God climactically in the incarnate Son, the radiance of the glory of God, known through the apostolic witness of Scripture and illumined by the Spirit. Any adequate account must integrate these strands: a real yet condemned **natural knowledge**, a decisive **special revelation** in Christ and Scripture, and a noetic antithesis between belief and unbelief.

Thomas Aquinas is the decisive architect of the classical account on both the metaphysical and epistemological sides. Writing in the context of high medieval scholasticism, with Aristotle’s metaphysics regained and Islamicate philosophy pressing hard questions, Aquinas sought to show that philosophy can genuinely reach the conclusion that God exists while insisting that only revelation discloses the mysteries of the Trinity and the economy of salvation. In the Summa Theologiae and Summa contra Gentiles he famously denies that the divine existence is self-evident to us but insists that it can be demonstrated from effects to cause. His **quinque viae** are exemplary causal arguments that, if sound, take us from motion, efficient causality, contingency, grades of perfection, and final causality to a first unmoved mover, uncaused cause, necessary being, maximal perfection, and ultimate final cause. The conclusion of these arguments is not a generic power but the one God who is **pure act**, whose essence is his existence. This is the heart of **classical theism**: **divine simplicity**, eternity, immutability, and the pure actuality and aseity of the Creator.

Examiners will likely ask whether Aquinas’s God is really the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob or a metaphysical abstraction. The best defense integrates Aquinas’s own insistence that such natural knowledge is only of God as principle of being, not yet as triune redeemer. Aquinas explicitly subordinates natural theology to faith seeking understanding, arguing that the mysteries of Trinity and incarnation exceed unaided reason and are known only by **supernatural revelation**. Yet he believes philosophy can show that there must be some first cause who is pure act and that such arguments can serve apologetic and preparatory functions. A Reformed candidate need not adopt Thomistic argumentation uncritically but must understand that the metaphysical grammar of **Creator–creature distinction** and **analogical predication** defended by Aquinas remains foundational. His doctrine of **analogical knowledge** of God insists that words like “good” or “wise” are predicated of God neither univocally nor equivocally but analogically, grounded in God’s creative causality. That is, creaturely perfections are effects of the divine perfection and so truly, though finitely, signify something of God. This analytic tool is crucial for defending knowability within the bounds of **incomprehensibility**. When examiners ask whether we can say anything literally true of a simple God, the Thomistic answer is that analogy, rooted in causal participation, allows real yet non-univocal predication.

John Calvin reconfigures the question by placing it decisively within the context of **covenant**, sin, and Scripture. Living at the dawn of the Reformation, disputing with both Roman scholastics and Renaissance skeptics, Calvin insists in the Institutes that there is an inescapable **sensus divinitatis**, a natural sense of deity implanted in all humans. The structure of the world and the structure of human conscience continually testify that there is a God to be worshiped. This is Calvin’s way of affirming Romans 1 and Psalm 19: creation and providence broadcast divine glory. Yet Calvin also insists that, because of sin, this natural awareness is always distorted, redirected to idols, or used to evade the true God. So while he will say that there is no nation so savage as not to be imbued with some sense of deity, he immediately adds that not one of them has kept within the true knowledge of God. This sharpened noetic antithesis distinguishes his Reformation reworking of the medieval tradition.

More radically, Calvin centers on Scripture as the **spectacles** by which we read the otherwise blurry revelation of God in nature. The knowledge of God as Creator is not simply a philosophical conclusion but a biblical teaching that orients our interpretation of the world. Moreover, saving knowledge of God as Redeemer is found only in the gospel of Christ. Calvin therefore tightens the relation between **existence** and **knowability**: the true and living God is not an abstract necessary being but the Lord who has bound himself to his people in covenant, who is Father, Son, and Spirit. Knowledge of this God is always a matter of piety and obedience, not detached speculation. To know God is to be addressed by his Word and summoned into faith and repentance. Examiners may press whether Calvin thereby repudiates natural theology. The answer is nuanced: he rejects autonomous natural theology as a project of reason independent of Scripture, but he affirms a genuine yet condemned **natural knowledge of God** that leaves unbelievers without excuse and that, under Scripture, can be appropriated and clarified.

Francis Turretin, as a leading representative of Reformed orthodoxy, stabilizes Calvin’s impulses into a more scholastic framework that directly addresses the relationship between natural and supernatural knowledge. In the Institutes of Elenctic Theology he asks whether the existence of God is known naturally; he answers affirmatively, distinguishing between innate and acquired knowledge, and distinguishing between the mode and degree of such knowledge in the regenerate and unregenerate. Turretin carefully preserves the Reformed conviction that revelation is necessary not only because of sin but also because of the natural finitude of the creature relative to the infinite Creator. God’s **incomprehensibility** is absolute: he cannot be known as he knows himself. Yet God is **knowable** truly because he freely condescends to reveal himself in created signs, both in the ad intra procession of the Word and Spirit and in the ad extra economy of creation and redemption.

Turretin also defends a moderated use of **theistic proofs**, arguing that while they do not compel faith, they remove excuses and confirm believers. For example, he endorses cosmological and teleological arguments but insists that they must be interpreted through Scripture and constrained by the doctrine of **divine simplicity** and **aseity**. This guards against treating the arguments as steps in a purely neutral rational project. In internal debates within the Reformed tradition, Turretin stands between later evidentialist trends, which tended to treat theistic proofs as common ground accessible to all rational agents, and more radical presuppositional critiques that deny any neutrality. A Westminster candidate must be able to characterize Turretin’s position precisely: he upholds **natural theology** as a real but limited knowledge of God as Creator, always intended to be situated under and normed by **special revelation**, and he grounds knowability in God’s free decision to communicate himself rather than in any natural capacity of reason as such.

Karl Barth represents a decisive twentieth century counterstroke against both Roman Catholic and Protestant forms of natural theology. Against the backdrop of liberal theology’s collapse in the face of the First World War and the cultural idolatries of German Christianity, Barth reasserted the **sovereignty of revelation**. In the Church Dogmatics he famously rejects natural theology, insisting that there is no path to God from human culture, religious consciousness, or metaphysics. God is known only where and as he makes himself known in Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh. For Barth, any appeal to an independent natural knowledge risks subjecting God to human criteria and blurring the radical otherness of divine grace. He reconfigures even the doctrine of **analogy** along these lines. Where Aquinas had spoken of an **analogia entis**, an analogy of being grounded in God’s creative act, Barth speaks of an analogia fidei, an analogy of faith, grounded solely in God’s self-identification in revelation. To know God is to encounter his address in Christ.

Examiner pressure on Barth will ask whether his denial of natural theology is consistent with Romans 1 and whether it undermines the catholic doctrine of **Creator–creature distinction**. The Reformed critique points out that if there is no genuine created sign of God apart from saving revelation in Christ, then the universality of human accountability and the visibility of divine glory in creation are muted. Moreover, if being itself as such has no analogical relation to God apart from Christ, the classical doctrine of **divine simplicity** as actus purus is difficult to sustain. Still, Barth forces a necessary question: does our account of knowability covertly domesticate God under philosophical categories. A robust classical Reformed position can learn from Barth’s warnings while not following his rejection of natural theology. It will insist that natural revelation is real and that there is a true though suppressed natural knowledge of God, but it will also insist that theology as a science operates not from the data of nature but from God’s self-witness in Scripture, and that only grace heals the noetic effects of sin.

Alvin Plantinga, finally, relocates the debate about the existence and knowability of God in the terrain of contemporary analytic epistemology. Confronting modern evidentialism, which held that belief in God is rational only if supported by adequate propositional evidence or arguments, Plantinga argues that such a standard is self-defeating and not itself justified by evidence. In Warranted Christian Belief he defends the idea that belief in God can be **properly basic**, rational and warranted even in the absence of inferential arguments, when formed in the right cognitive environment by properly functioning faculties according to a design plan successfully aimed at truth. Here he explicitly revives the **sensus divinitatis** of Calvin, construing it as a cognitive faculty that produces belief in God in circumstances of, for example, contemplating the starry heavens or experiencing guilt. Under the impact of sin this faculty is damaged or suppressed; under the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit it is repaired and extended to produce belief in the central Christian doctrines.

Plantinga therefore reshapes the “knowability” discussion in terms of **epistemic warrant** rather than demonstration. His point is not that arguments for the existence of God are useless but that belief in God does not need them to be rational. This undermines the charge that theism is irrational or unjustified in the absence of proofs. It also highlights that knowledge of God is **personal and testimonial**: it arises from God’s own cognitive design and internal witness. Examiners will likely ask whether Plantinga succumbs to subjectivism or fideism. The appropriate response is that his model is constrained by an objective **design plan** and by the real external world; it is not mere psychological comfort. Moreover, by retrieving the noetic antithesis and the necessity of the Spirit’s work, he aligns with a robust Reformed doctrine of the **internal testimony of the Spirit**, which grounds the believer’s assurance that Scripture is the Word of God.

Having surveyed these figures, we must now articulate a coherent and defensible position suitable for oral defense. First, we affirm that God’s **existence** is a metaphysical necessity grounded in **divine aseity** and **simplicity**. God is not one being among others but the self-existent act of to-be, the triune Lord whose essence is identical with his existence, who is the source, sustainer, and end of all that is not God. This God can be reached by philosophical arguments in a limited way. Classical cosmological and teleological arguments, suitably reformulated within a robust doctrine of being, can show that the contingent, changing, ordered world requires a necessary, uncaused, intelligent cause. However, such arguments at most yield a creator, not yet the triune God of the gospel, and they are not religiously salvific. Their value is secondary: they can remove obstacles, expose the incoherence of naturalistic metaphysics, and display that Christian confession is not irrational. They cannot be the foundation of theology.

Second, we affirm that God is **incomprehensible** yet **knowable**. Incomprehensibility means that no finite intellect can circumscribe or fully grasp the infinite being of God. This is grounded in the infinite qualitative distinction between Creator and creature. Knowability means that God has freely willed to make himself known and that his knowledge of himself can be reflected analogically in creaturely minds through his acts of revelation. The mode of this knowledge is **analogical knowledge**: our concepts truly refer to God but never as adequate or exhaustive. This is secured by **revelation**: the external works of God in creation, providence, and redemption, and preeminently the inscripturated Word testifying to the incarnate Word. The internal ground of our knowledge is the work of the Spirit, who both inspired Scripture and illumines believers to receive and understand it.

Third, we affirm that there is a true, universal **natural knowledge of God** through **general revelation** in creation and conscience, as Romans 1 and Calvin testify, but that this knowledge is always suppressed and distorted in unbelief. It renders humanity without excuse but does not bring about saving faith. As such, it is epistemically real but soteriologically insufficient. The project of an autonomous natural theology that would use this knowledge to build a neutral foundation valid for believer and unbeliever alike is incoherent, because it ignores the covenantal and ethical dimensions of knowing. Knowledge of God is not a bare intellectual act but already obedience or disobedience. Therefore, any “shared” rational discourse about God takes place within the context of the antithesis between belief and unbelief. The Reformed position can thus acknowledge real contact points in reason and creation, while insisting that only under the norm of Scripture and the regenerating work of the Spirit are those contact points rightly read.

Fourth, we affirm that **special revelation** in Christ and Scripture is the principium of theology and the decisive mode of divine self-disclosure. The existence and knowability of God are not generic but specifically trinitarian and christological. What we know of God as Father, Son, and Spirit, of his eternal life and his will to redeem, comes only through the history of Israel and the apostles, interpreted by the inspired text and applied by the Spirit. Knowledge of God as Redeemer is inseparable from faith in Christ. Thus, in theology proper, we do not first construct a doctrine of God from nature and only later “add” Trinity and economy. Rather, we receive the one God as he gives himself to be known in Christ and then recognize that this same God is the Creator whose power and divinity we had always misread in creation. The unity of **Creator and Redeemer** in the one Lord stabilizes both natural and special knowledge in a single personal subject.

Addressing contemporary external objections, such as the argument from divine hiddenness or from religious pluralism, this position has substantial resources. On hiddenness, the claim that a loving God would make his existence more obvious fails to account for the reality of culpable suppression and the moral dimension of knowledge. God has, in fact, made himself plain in creation and in the gospel; the problem lies not in insufficient evidence but in rebellious hearts. Moreover, God’s purpose is not mere bare belief in his existence but covenant fellowship in Christ. He hides and reveals himself according to a redemptive wisdom that aims at the formation of faith, humility, and love rather than coerced acknowledgment. On pluralism, the assertion that multiple religious claims cancel one another presupposes that God, if he exists, would not choose a specific historical mode of self-revelation. The Christian confession instead insists that God has decisively spoken in the Son and that other religious awarenesses are either dim remnants of natural knowledge or deviations from it. This is compatible with acknowledging partial truths and with engaging other religions respectfully, but it refuses to relativize the finality of Christ.

Internal contemporary debates, especially between evidentialist apologetics and **Reformed epistemology**, can also be located within this framework. Evidentialists are right to insist that Christian faith is not irrational and that the Christian worldview can answer objections. Reformed epistemologists are right to insist that belief in God can be rational in the absence of such arguments, and that the foundational warrant of faith is God’s own self-witness, not our inferential constructions. The best synthesis is to recognize that the Spirit ordinarily uses both the internal testimony of the Word and the external reasons and evidences presented to the mind. Arguments may play a role in removing defeaters or in strengthening believers rather than in forming faith de novo. This leaves intact the Reformed insistence on **Scripture as self-authenticating** through the Spirit and on the primacy of God’s own self-revelation.

In cross-locus perspective, the existence and knowability of God intersect directly with **bibliology**, **anthropology**, and **soteriology**. If God is unknowable in principle, then Scripture cannot be a meaningful revelation of God and theology collapses. If humans are not created with a natural orientation to God and a capacity for **analogical knowledge**, then even revelation would have no foothold in the mind. If sin has not devastated our cognitive and moral powers, we are tempted to treat knowledge of God as a neutral intellectual achievement rather than a gift of grace. Conversely, if grace did not include the illumination of the mind and the reorientation of the heart, faith would be irrational trust rather than a knowledgeable embrace of God’s promise. Holding the topic together thus supports a robust doctrine of revelation, a realistic doctrine of sin, and a grace-centered doctrine of faith.

In sum, a candidate should own and defend the following: the one, simple, triune God exists necessarily and is the metaphysical ground of all that is; he is infinitely **incomprehensible** to creatures yet truly and analogically **knowable** by virtue of his free self-revelation; there is a real though suppressed **natural knowledge of God** through creation and conscience that leaves all people without excuse; this knowledge does not save and is always distorted apart from grace; God’s climactic self-revelation in Christ and Scripture provides the content and norm of true theology; and the Spirit’s internal testimony grants warrant and assurance to faith such that belief in God and in the gospel is rational, warranted, and obedient. This stance incorporates what is best in Aquinas’s classical metaphysics, Calvin’s and Turretin’s covenantal and revelational focus, Barth’s warning against autonomous natural theology, and Plantinga’s rehabilitation of basic theistic belief, while remaining anchored in confessional Reformed theology.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The **existence** of God is the necessary, self-existent reality of the simple, triune Creator distinct from the world; the **knowability of God** is the possibility and actuality of true yet analogical human knowledge of this God by virtue of his free self-revelation in creation and Scripture, under the illumination of the Spirit.
- Decisive figures: Aquinas defends demonstrable knowledge of God’s existence and **analogical knowledge** within **classical theism**; Calvin stresses the **sensus divinitatis**, noetic effects of sin, and Scripture as spectacles; Turretin systematizes Reformed teaching on **natural and supernatural knowledge** and the moderated use of theistic proofs; Barth rejects natural theology to guard the sovereignty of revelation in Christ; Plantinga recasts knowledge of God in terms of properly basic belief and **Reformed epistemology**.
- Debates: Internal: scope and use of **natural theology** within classical and Reformed traditions, and the mode of **analogical predication**; External: enlightenment rationalism, atheism, objections from divine hiddenness and pluralism; Contemporary: evidentialism versus properly basic theism, autonomy of reason versus **Scripture as principium**, and the role of analytic philosophy in theology.
- Defended position: The triune God necessarily exists as simple, self-sufficient Creator; he is **incomprehensible** yet **knowable** by **analogical knowledge** grounded in his self-revelation; there is a real yet suppressed natural knowledge of God, but theology proceeds from special revelation, and faith’s warrant rests fundamentally on the Spirit’s internal testimony rather than on autonomous proofs.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:  
  - How can an incomprehensible God be truly known? Because God freely adapts his self-knowledge to creaturely modes of understanding, yielding **analogical knowledge** that is true though never exhaustive.  
  - Does Reformed theology affirm natural theology? It affirms real **natural knowledge of God** through general revelation, rejects autonomous natural theology, and subordinates all reasoning about God to Scripture.  
  - Are theistic proofs necessary for rational belief in God? No, belief in God can be properly basic and warranted by God’s design and the Spirit’s work, though arguments can play a secondary, confirmatory role.  
  - How do you answer Barth’s rejection of natural theology in light of Romans 1? By affirming Barth’s concern to protect the sovereignty of revelation while insisting with Paul and the Reformed tradition that creation genuinely and universally reveals God, knowledge of which is culpably suppressed.  
  - What guards your account from collapsing into subjectivism? The objectivity of God’s **self-revelation** in creation and Scripture, the reality of a divine **design plan** for human cognition, and the church’s confessional rule of faith together anchor individual knowing in an external, triune reality.
