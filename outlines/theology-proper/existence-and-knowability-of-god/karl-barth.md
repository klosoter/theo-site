# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically reoriented the doctrine of the **existence and knowability of God** by insisting that God is known only through **divine self-revelation** in Jesus Christ, not through human reason or natural theology. He rejected all autonomous attempts to access God, emphasizing the utter **transcendence** and **freedom** of God in revealing himself, and locating true knowledge of God within the event of **revelation** mediated by the Word and the Holy Spirit.

- "God is known only by God; only God can speak about God, and only God can be spoken about." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Church Dogmatics II/1: The Doctrine of God
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Anselm: Fides Quaerens Intellectum
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the sole basis for knowing God**
    - God is known only where and when God chooses to reveal himself.
    - Revelation is a free act of God, not a human achievement.
    - Jesus Christ is the definitive form of God's self-revelation.
    - The Bible is the witness to revelation, not revelation itself.
    - "God reveals Himself. Revelation means self-unveiling, imparted by God Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Rejection of natural theology**
    - Human reason cannot ascend to knowledge of God apart from revelation.
    - All attempts at natural theology are forms of idolatry or self-projection.
    - Barth’s “Nein!” to Emil Brunner epitomizes his stance against natural theology.
    - True knowledge of God is always a miracle of grace, not a human possibility.
    - "There is no path from humanity to God, not even a via negativa." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

3. **God’s transcendence and hiddenness**
    - God is wholly other (ganz andere) and cannot be grasped by human concepts.
    - Divine hiddenness is overcome only by God’s initiative in revelation.
    - God’s freedom means he is never at human disposal.
    - Knowledge of God is always indirect, mediated, and analogical.
    - "God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

4. **Christocentric epistemology**
    - Jesus Christ is the center and content of all true knowledge of God.
    - All revelation is mediated through the incarnate Word.
    - The doctrine of election is grounded in Christ as both the electing God and elected man.
    - Knowledge of God is inseparable from faith in Christ.
    - "In Jesus Christ, God reveals Himself as the One who loves in freedom." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit and the Word**
    - The Holy Spirit enables true knowledge of God by illuminating the Word.
    - Scripture becomes the Word of God in the event of revelation.
    - The church is the community gathered by the Spirit to hear God’s Word.
    - Human response is always secondary to God’s prior act of revelation.
    - "The Word of God is God Himself in His revelation." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s doctrine of the **existence and knowability of God** decisively shifted twentieth-century theology away from **natural theology** and toward a robustly **Christocentric** and revelational approach. His emphasis on God’s freedom and transcendence continues to shape Protestant dogmatics, especially in the Reformed tradition. Barth’s critique of autonomous reason and insistence on revelation as the only ground for knowledge of God remain central in contemporary debates about theology and epistemology.
