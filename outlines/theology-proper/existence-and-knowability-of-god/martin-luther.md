# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther emphasized the **hiddenness of God** and the necessity of **revelation** for true knowledge of the divine. He rejected the sufficiency of **natural theology** and insisted that God is known only through **Christ** as revealed in **Scripture**, not through human reason or speculation. For Luther, the **existence and knowability of God** are inseparable from the **theology of the cross** and the self-disclosure of God in the gospel.

- "God in his own nature and majesty is to be left alone; in this regard, we have nothing to do with him, nor does he wish us to deal with him." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Key Works

- The Bondage of the Will
- Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- Lectures on Romans
- Large Catechism
- Luther’s Preface to Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Hiddenness and Revelation**
    - God is fundamentally hidden (Deus absconditus) apart from his self-revelation.
    - Human reason cannot penetrate the divine essence or will.
    - God reveals himself where he wills, chiefly in Christ and the gospel.
    - The distinction between the hidden God and the revealed God is central to Luther’s theology.
    - "God must be left to himself in his own majesty, for in this respect we have nothing to do with him." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Primacy of Christ for Knowing God**
    - True knowledge of God is mediated exclusively through Christ.
    - Christ is the only reliable revelation of God’s character and will.
    - The cross is the definitive locus of God’s self-disclosure.
    - Any attempt to know God apart from Christ leads to error and idolatry.
    - "He who would comprehend God and the manner of his being must look at the child in the Virgin’s lap." (Sermon on Christmas Day, 1522)

3. **Scripture as the Norm for Divine Knowledge**
    - Scripture is the only trustworthy source for knowledge of God.
    - The Word of God is clear and sufficient for salvation and doctrine.
    - Human traditions and philosophical speculation are to be rejected.
    - The Holy Spirit illumines Scripture to reveal God to believers.
    - "The Holy Scriptures everywhere ascribe this as peculiar to God’s Word, that it is a light to the feet and a lamp to the path." (Preface to the Old Testament)

4. **Critique of Natural Theology**
    - Human reason is corrupted by sin and cannot arrive at saving knowledge of God.
    - Natural revelation is insufficient for understanding God’s will or grace.
    - Attempts to prove God’s existence philosophically are ultimately futile.
    - Faith, not reason, is the means by which God is known.
    - "Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has." (Table Talk)

5. **Theology of the Cross**
    - God reveals himself paradoxically in suffering and weakness.
    - The cross exposes the inadequacy of human wisdom and speculation.
    - The true knowledge of God comes through humility and faith, not achievement.
    - The theology of glory is rejected in favor of the theology of the cross.
    - "He deserves to be called a theologian… who comprehends the visible and manifest things of God seen through suffering and the cross." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 20)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s emphasis on the **hiddenness of God** and the necessity of **revelation in Christ** profoundly shaped Protestant approaches to the **existence and knowability of God**. His rejection of **natural theology** and insistence on **Scripture alone** as the source of divine knowledge influenced later Reformed and Lutheran traditions. Luther’s theology of the cross continues to challenge attempts to know God apart from the humility and paradox of the gospel. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the limits of reason and the centrality of Christ for knowing God.
