# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner emphasized the **knowability of God** through a combination of **divine revelation** and the **imago Dei** in humanity, while maintaining that God's **essence** remains ultimately transcendent and mysterious. He rejected both rationalistic **natural theology** and strict **revelation-only** approaches, advocating for a "point of contact" between God and human beings grounded in **creation** and **encounter**. Brunner’s theology is marked by a dialectical tension between God’s **hiddenness** and **self-disclosure**.

- "God is never an object which we can observe, but always the One who encounters us." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. I)
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- Nature and Grace
- Man in Revolt
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Knowability Rooted in Revelation**
    - God can be truly known only because He has chosen to reveal Himself.
    - Revelation is both personal and historical, centered supremely in Jesus Christ.
    - Human knowledge of God is always dependent on God’s initiative.
    - Revelation is not mere information but a divine-human encounter.
    - "God can be known only where He Himself makes Himself known." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **The Imago Dei as Point of Contact**
    - Humanity retains a formal capacity for God due to being made in God’s image.
    - The "point of contact" is not a natural human ability, but a relational openness to God.
    - Sin distorts but does not erase the imago Dei, allowing for the possibility of revelation.
    - This concept opposes both total depravity (as inability) and autonomous reason.
    - "The image of God in man is the presupposition of the possibility of revelation." (Nature and Grace)

3. **Rejection of Purely Rational Natural Theology**
    - Human reason alone cannot attain knowledge of God’s essence.
    - Brunner critiques classical proofs for God’s existence as insufficient.
    - Natural theology is possible only in light of revelation, not apart from it.
    - He opposes both rationalism and fideism, seeking a mediating position.
    - "There is no way from man to God... but God Himself takes the initiative." (Nature and Grace)

4. **God’s Hiddenness and Transcendence**
    - God’s essence remains ultimately incomprehensible to finite minds.
    - Even in revelation, God is never fully grasped or contained by human concepts.
    - The distinction between God’s essence (Wesen) and His revelation (Offenbarung) is crucial.
    - This preserves both divine freedom and the necessity of faith.
    - "God is always greater than our thought of Him." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

5. **Truth as Encounter**
    - Knowledge of God is not abstract but existential and relational.
    - Faith is the response to God’s personal address in revelation.
    - The encounter with God transforms the knower, not just the knowledge.
    - This approach emphasizes the dynamic, living character of divine-human relationship.
    - "Truth happens to us as an event, as an encounter." (Truth as Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s nuanced approach to the **existence and knowability of God** shaped mid-20th-century Protestant theology, especially in dialogue with Karl Barth and neo-orthodoxy. His insistence on the **imago Dei** as a point of contact influenced debates on revelation, anthropology, and apologetics. While criticized for ambiguity regarding natural theology, Brunner’s emphasis on **revelation as encounter** continues to inform discussions on the relational and existential dimensions of knowing God. His work remains a significant reference point for understanding the dialectic between divine transcendence and self-disclosure.
