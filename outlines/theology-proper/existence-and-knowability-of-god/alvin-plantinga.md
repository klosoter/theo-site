# Alvin Plantinga (1932–)

Alvin Plantinga is a leading figure in **analytic philosophy of religion**, known for his robust defense of the **rationality of belief in God** and the **knowability of God** apart from classical evidentialist arguments. He advances the notion that **belief in God** can be **properly basic**, grounded in **reformed epistemology**, and not dependent on inferential evidence or argument.

- "Belief in God is properly basic; that is, it does not require argument or evidence for its rationality or justification." ("Reason and Belief in God," in Faith and Rationality)

## Key Works

- God and Other Minds (1967)
- The Nature of Necessity (1974)
- Warranted Christian Belief (2000)
- Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God (co-edited with Nicholas Wolterstorff, 1983)
- Knowledge and Christian Belief (2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Belief in God as Properly Basic**
    - Argues that **belief in God** does not require inferential evidence to be rational.
    - Draws on the analogy of belief in other minds or the external world as basic beliefs.
    - Emphasizes the role of the **sensus divinitatis** as a natural faculty.
    - Rejects classical foundationalism as too restrictive for rational belief.
    - "If my model is correct, then belief in God is properly basic and rationally acceptable without evidence or argument." (Warranted Christian Belief)

2. **Reformed Epistemology**
    - Develops a model where **theistic belief** is justified apart from evidentialist criteria.
    - Influenced by Calvin and the Reformed tradition’s emphasis on the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit**.
    - Argues that **Christian belief** can have warrant if produced by cognitive faculties functioning properly in the appropriate environment.
    - Challenges the de jure objection that Christian belief is irrational or unjustified.
    - "According to Reformed epistemology, belief in God is entirely proper and rational even if the believer has no arguments or evidence for it." (Faith and Rationality)

3. **Critique of Classical Foundationalism**
    - Criticizes the evidentialist demand that only beliefs based on self-evidence, incorrigibility, or sense perception are rational.
    - Argues that this standard is self-defeating and excludes many rational beliefs.
    - Proposes a broader, more inclusive understanding of rationality.
    - Suggests that **theistic belief** is at least as rational as belief in the past or other minds.
    - "Classical foundationalism is itself neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses." (Warranted Christian Belief)

4. **Warrant and Proper Function**
    - Introduces the concept of **warrant** as what turns true belief into knowledge.
    - Asserts that warranted belief arises when cognitive faculties are functioning properly, according to a design plan, in the right environment.
    - Applies this to **theistic belief**, arguing it can be warranted if God exists and has designed humans to know Him.
    - Distinguishes between **de facto** and **de jure** objections to Christian belief.
    - "A belief has warrant for a person if it is produced by cognitive faculties functioning properly in a congenial epistemic environment according to a design plan successfully aimed at truth." (Warranted Christian Belief)

5. **The Ontological and Modal Arguments**
    - Revitalizes the **ontological argument** using modal logic to argue for the possibility of God’s existence implying actuality.
    - Defends the coherence and philosophical viability of **necessary being**.
    - Explores the implications of **possible worlds semantics** for the existence of God.
    - Engages with critics to refine and clarify the modal ontological argument.
    - "If it is possible that a maximally great being exists, then a maximally great being exists." (The Nature of Necessity)

## Legacy and Impact

Plantinga’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary **philosophy of religion**, especially through his articulation of **reformed epistemology** and his critique of evidentialist objections to theistic belief. His arguments have provided a robust intellectual foundation for the rationality and knowability of God, influencing both analytic philosophy and evangelical theology. Plantinga’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about **warrant**, **proper function**, and the epistemic status of religious belief.
