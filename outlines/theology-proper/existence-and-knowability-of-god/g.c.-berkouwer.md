# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **existence and knowability of God** with a strong emphasis on the self-revelation of God in **Scripture** and the necessity of **faith** for true knowledge. He rejected both rationalistic proofs and agnostic skepticism, arguing that knowledge of God is possible only through God's **gracious initiative** and is always mediated by **revelation** in Christ. Berkouwer maintained that theological reflection must remain attentive to the dynamic relationship between **revelation, faith, and human response**.

- "The knowledge of God is not a neutral or theoretical matter, but is always bound up with the reality of revelation and the response of faith." (The Providence of God)

- Holy Scripture (Studies in Dogmatics)
- A Half Century of Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Foundation of Knowledge**
    - Knowledge of God is grounded in God's self-disclosure, not human speculation.
    - Revelation is both **historical** and **personal**, culminating in Christ.
    - Human knowledge is always dependent on God's initiative.
    - Revelation is not merely propositional but relational and redemptive.
    - "Revelation is not a deposit of information, but the living address of God to man." (Faith and Revelation)

2. **Faith as the Proper Response to Revelation**
    - True knowledge of God arises only in the context of faith.
    - Faith is not irrational but is a response to God's trustworthy self-revelation.
    - The act of faith is inseparable from the content of revelation.
    - Faith involves personal trust and obedience, not mere assent.
    - "Faith is not a leap in the dark, but a response to the light of revelation." (Faith and Revelation)

3. **Critique of Natural Theology**
    - Berkouwer rejects autonomous natural theology as insufficient for true knowledge of God.
    - He affirms that general revelation leaves humanity without excuse but does not save.
    - The **noetic effects of sin** distort human perception of God in nature.
    - Any knowledge of God from creation must be interpreted through Scripture.
    - "Natural theology, when separated from revelation, becomes a theology of autonomy." (General Revelation)

4. **The Limits of Human Knowledge**
    - Human knowledge of God is always **analogical** and never exhaustive.
    - Mystery is inherent in the knowledge of the infinite God by finite creatures.
    - Theological humility is required in all doctrinal formulations.
    - The hiddenness of God does not negate His knowability but preserves His transcendence.
    - "We must always remember that our knowledge is knowledge in part." (General Revelation)

5. **Christocentric Epistemology**
    - Christ is the center and fullness of God's self-revelation.
    - All knowledge of God is mediated through the person and work of Christ.
    - The incarnation is the decisive event for understanding God's knowability.
    - The Holy Spirit enables believers to know God in Christ.
    - "In Christ, the question of the knowability of God finds its answer." (Faith and Revelation)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer's nuanced approach to the **existence and knowability of God** significantly shaped twentieth-century **Reformed theology**, especially in its engagement with modern philosophy and ecumenical dialogue. His insistence on the primacy of revelation and the centrality of Christ provided a corrective to both rationalism and fideism. Berkouwer's work continues to influence theologians who seek to uphold the authority of Scripture while engaging contemporary questions about faith and knowledge.
