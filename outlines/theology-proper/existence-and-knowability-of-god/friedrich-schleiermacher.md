# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the **existence and knowability of God** by grounding religious knowledge in the **feeling of absolute dependence** rather than in traditional metaphysical or rational proofs. He argued that God is not an object of speculative reason but is known through the immediate self-consciousness of the finite in relation to the infinite, making **God-consciousness** the foundation of theology. This approach shifted the focus from **objective revelation** to the **subjective experience** of the divine.

- "To be conscious of oneself as absolutely dependent and to be conscious of God are one and the same." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as the Whence of Absolute Dependence**
    - God is not an object among objects but the underlying ground of all existence.
    - Human awareness of God arises from the feeling of absolute dependence, not from rational inference.
    - This feeling is universal and foundational to all religious experience.
    - God’s existence is presupposed in the structure of self-consciousness.
    - "God is for us only in so far as He is felt to be the Whence of our absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Traditional Natural Theology**
    - Rational or empirical proofs for God’s existence are inadequate and misguided.
    - Knowledge of God cannot be attained through cosmological or ontological arguments.
    - Theological method must begin with religious experience, not abstract speculation.
    - Revelation is internal, not external or propositional.
    - "Proofs for the existence of God are therefore superfluous, for God is given in self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Primacy of Religious Feeling**
    - Religion is rooted in immediate self-consciousness, not in doctrine or ethics.
    - The feeling of absolute dependence is the essence of piety.
    - Knowledge of God is experiential, not conceptual or propositional.
    - This feeling unites all religious traditions at a fundamental level.
    - "Religion’s essence is neither thinking nor acting, but intuition and feeling." (On Religion)

4. **God’s Knowability as Mediated and Indirect**
    - God is never directly known as an object but is apprehended through the mediation of feeling.
    - All knowledge of God is analogical and symbolic, shaped by historical and cultural context.
    - The finite cannot comprehend the infinite; knowledge of God is always fragmentary.
    - Theology is a reflection on the God-consciousness present in the community.
    - "We never have God as an object, but only the feeling of His presence." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Christ as the Highest God-Consciousness**
    - Christ represents the perfect realization of God-consciousness in humanity.
    - The uniqueness of Christ is found in his unbroken and complete feeling of dependence on God.
    - Knowledge of God is most fully mediated through the person of Christ.
    - The church is the community where God-consciousness is cultivated and expressed.
    - "In Christ, the God-consciousness was absolutely powerful and determined all else." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s emphasis on **religious experience** as the basis for the knowledge of God profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in the development of **liberal Protestantism**. His rejection of classical proofs and focus on **subjectivity** paved the way for later existential and phenomenological approaches to theology. While criticized for undermining objective revelation, his work remains foundational for discussions on the **knowability of God** and the nature of religious consciousness. Schleiermacher’s influence endures in contemporary debates over the relationship between faith, experience, and reason.
