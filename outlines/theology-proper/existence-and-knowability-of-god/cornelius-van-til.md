# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til argued that the **existence and knowability of God** are inseparable from the **Creator-creature distinction** and the necessity of **revelation**. He maintained that human knowledge of God is always **analogical**, dependent on God's self-disclosure, and that **presuppositional apologetics** is the only method consistent with Reformed theology.

- "God is known only because and insofar as he has revealed himself." (The Defense of the Faith)

- The Defense of the Faith
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Apologetics
- A Survey of Christian Epistemology
- Common Grace and the Gospel

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence Is Self-Attesting**
    - God’s existence is the necessary presupposition for all rational thought.
    - No fact or law is intelligible apart from the triune God.
    - The denial of God leads to epistemological futility.
    - God is not subject to human verification or falsification.
    - "The only proof for the existence of God is that without God you could not prove anything." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Revelation Is Foundational for Knowledge of God**
    - All true knowledge of God depends on his voluntary self-revelation.
    - Both **general** and **special revelation** are necessary and authoritative.
    - Human reason is always subordinate to divine revelation.
    - Scripture is the ultimate standard for theology and epistemology.
    - "God’s revelation is the presupposition of all intelligible human predication." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God is ontologically distinct from creation; he is absolute, we are dependent.
    - Human knowledge is always analogical, never univocal or purely equivocal.
    - The distinction safeguards both divine transcendence and immanence.
    - All attempts at autonomous reasoning collapse into irrationalism or skepticism.
    - "We must maintain the absolute difference between the Creator and the creature." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Presuppositional Apologetics**
    - Apologetics must begin with the presupposition of the truth of Christian theism.
    - Neutrality in reasoning is a myth; all thought is governed by ultimate commitments.
    - The unbeliever suppresses the knowledge of God revealed in nature and conscience.
    - The task of apologetics is to expose the impossibility of the contrary.
    - "There is no point of contact except that which exists by virtue of man’s being made in the image of God." (Christian Apologetics)

5. **Antithesis Between Belief and Unbelief**
    - There is a fundamental opposition between the Christian and non-Christian worldviews.
    - The regenerate mind submits to God’s revelation; the unregenerate mind suppresses it.
    - Common ground exists only because of **common grace** and the image of God.
    - The antithesis is epistemological, ethical, and spiritual.
    - "The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him." (A Survey of Christian Epistemology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **existence and knowability of God** reshaped Reformed apologetics by insisting on the primacy of **presuppositions** and the necessity of divine revelation. His influence is evident in the development of **Reformed epistemology** and the work of later thinkers such as Greg Bahnsen and John Frame. Van Til’s emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and analogical knowledge continues to shape contemporary discussions on the relationship between faith and reason. His legacy endures in both academic theology and practical apologetics within the Reformed tradition.
