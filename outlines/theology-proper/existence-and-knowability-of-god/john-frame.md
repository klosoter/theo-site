# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the **existence and knowability of God** through his distinctive **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing that God’s reality and revelation are inescapable and foundational for all knowledge. He insists that **God’s lordship**, **self-revelation**, and the **covenantal context** of knowledge make God both knowable and the necessary precondition for any human understanding, while also affirming the Creator-creature distinction.

- "God is both known and knowable, yet always beyond our comprehension." ("The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Apologetics to the Glory of God (1994)
- Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought (1995)
- A History of Western Philosophy and Theology (2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Triperspectival Epistemology**
    - Knowledge of God is approached through the **normative** (God’s Word), **situational** (the world), and **existential** (the self) perspectives.
    - Each perspective is interdependent and necessary for a full account of knowing God.
    - This model reflects the unity and diversity within the Trinity and God’s revelation.
    - Human knowledge is analogical, never exhaustive, but always true as God gives it.
    - "All knowledge is perspectival, rooted in God’s revelation." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

2. **Covenantal Context of Knowledge**
    - Human knowledge of God is always within the context of a covenant relationship.
    - God initiates and sustains this relationship, making Himself known as Lord.
    - The **authority**, **control**, and **presence** of God shape all epistemology.
    - Unbelief is not a lack of evidence but a moral rebellion against God’s covenantal lordship.
    - "To know God is to be in covenant with him, not merely to have information about him." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

3. **Necessity of Divine Revelation**
    - God must reveal Himself for true knowledge; human reason alone is insufficient.
    - **Scripture** is the primary and normative means of God’s self-disclosure.
    - General revelation is real but always interpreted through the lens of special revelation.
    - The Holy Spirit enables and authenticates true knowledge of God.
    - "Without God’s revelation, we could know nothing at all." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Creator-Creature Distinction and Analogical Knowledge**
    - God is ontologically distinct from creation; our knowledge is always analogical.
    - We can know God truly but never exhaustively or comprehensively.
    - The **incomprehensibility of God** safeguards His transcendence and our humility.
    - All human knowledge is dependent, derivative, and subordinate to God’s knowledge.
    - "We know God as he reveals himself, but never as he knows himself." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

5. **Presuppositional Apologetics**
    - The existence and knowability of God are the necessary preconditions for intelligibility.
    - All reasoning rests on ultimate commitments; neutrality is impossible.
    - The unbeliever suppresses the truth of God revealed in creation and conscience.
    - Apologetics is a defense of the Christian worldview as the only coherent foundation for knowledge.
    - "God is not merely an object of knowledge, but the foundation of all knowledge." (Apologetics to the Glory of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s **triperspectivalism** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed epistemology and apologetics, especially within the Westminster tradition. His emphasis on the **covenantal context** and the necessity of **divine revelation** has influenced generations of theologians and pastors. By integrating Van Til’s presuppositionalism with a robust doctrine of God’s lordship, Frame has provided a distinctive and influential approach to the existence and knowability of God. His work continues to be a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between theology, philosophy, and the Christian life.
