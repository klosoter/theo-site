# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge affirmed the **existence and knowability of God** as foundational to **systematic theology**, emphasizing that God’s being and attributes are both revealed in **nature** and **Scripture**. He upheld the **analogy of being** between God and humanity, insisting that while God is incomprehensible in essence, He is truly knowable through **general and special revelation**.

- "God is, and that He can be known, are the two great postulates of all religion." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- The Way of Life
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Princeton Sermons
- "Theology" article in the Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Rationally Demonstrable**
    - Hodge argued that **natural theology** provides valid proofs for God’s existence.
    - He affirmed the legitimacy of **cosmological**, **teleological**, and **moral arguments**.
    - Reason and observation of the world point to a personal, infinite Creator.
    - These arguments are preparatory, not sufficient for saving knowledge.
    - "The existence of God is a fact which the mind is forced to admit." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **God is Knowable but Incomprehensible**
    - God’s **essence** cannot be fully comprehended by finite minds.
    - True knowledge of God is possible through His **self-revelation**.
    - Hodge distinguished between **comprehending** and **apprehending** God.
    - The **analogy of being** allows for real, though limited, knowledge.
    - "We can know God truly, though not exhaustively." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Revelation is Both General and Special**
    - **General revelation** in nature and conscience reveals God’s existence and some attributes.
    - **Special revelation** in Scripture is necessary for knowledge of God’s redemptive purposes.
    - Both forms of revelation are consistent and complementary.
    - Scripture is the ultimate authority for theological knowledge.
    - "The Bible is the only infallible rule of faith and practice." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Faith and Reason are Harmonious**
    - Hodge rejected rationalism and fideism, advocating for their proper relationship.
    - Reason is the instrument by which revelation is received and understood.
    - Faith is not irrational but rests on sufficient evidence provided by God.
    - The Holy Spirit enables true knowledge of God through faith.
    - "Faith is not a blind, irrational assent, but a well-grounded conviction." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **The Objectivity of Theological Knowledge**
    - The knowledge of God is not subjective or mystical, but grounded in objective revelation.
    - Theology is a science, with doctrines derived from the facts of Scripture.
    - The **analogy of faith** guides interpretation and systematization.
    - The reality of God’s existence and knowability is the starting point for all doctrine.
    - "Theology is the science of the facts of divine revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **existence and knowability of God** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially at Princeton Seminary. His insistence on the harmony of **faith and reason** and the centrality of **revelation** provided a bulwark against both Enlightenment rationalism and theological liberalism. Hodge’s systematic approach continues to influence evangelical and Reformed thought, particularly in the areas of **prolegomena** and the doctrine of God.
