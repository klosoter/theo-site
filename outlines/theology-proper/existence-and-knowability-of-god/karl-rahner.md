# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the **existence and knowability of God** through a distinctive synthesis of **transcendental Thomism** and existential philosophy. He argued that human beings possess an innate **openness to the infinite**—the **supernatural existential**—which grounds both the possibility and the reality of knowledge of God, while maintaining the **mystery** and **incomprehensibility** of the divine.

- "The term ‘God’ signifies for us the incomprehensible, absolute mystery." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Foundations of Christian Faith (Grundkurs des Glaubens)
- Spirit in the World
- Hearer of the Word
- Theological Investigations (multiple volumes)
- Anonymous Christianity (essay in Theological Investigations, Vol. 6)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Transcendental openness to God**
    - Human consciousness is structured by a fundamental orientation toward **absolute being**.
    - This orientation is not empirical but a priori, grounding the possibility of knowing God.
    - Every act of knowing implicitly refers to the infinite horizon of God.
    - The **supernatural existential** is a permanent condition of human existence.
    - "Man is always already oriented toward God by the very structure of his being." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **God as Absolute Mystery**
    - God’s essence remains ultimately **incomprehensible** to finite minds.
    - Knowledge of God is always mediated by analogy and negation.
    - The more we know God, the more we realize His mystery.
    - Affirmations about God are always accompanied by a greater negation.
    - "God is not what we think we understand by the word ‘God’." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)

3. **Supernatural existential**
    - Every person is endowed with a **supernatural orientation** toward God.
    - This is not a result of grace added to nature, but a constitutive element of human existence.
    - It grounds the universal possibility of salvation and knowledge of God.
    - The supernatural existential bridges the natural and supernatural orders.
    - "Grace is offered to man from the very outset of his existence." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Revelation as self-communication of God**
    - God’s revelation is understood as His **self-communication** to humanity.
    - This self-communication is both historical (in Christ) and existential (in human experience).
    - Revelation is not merely propositional but personal and relational.
    - Human knowledge of God is always a response to God’s prior initiative.
    - "Revelation means that God communicates himself to man." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Faith as transcendental response**
    - Faith is the free, personal acceptance of God’s self-communication.
    - It is rooted in the **transcendental openness** of human subjectivity.
    - Faith involves both knowledge and trust, transcending mere rational assent.
    - The act of faith is enabled by grace but requires human cooperation.
    - "Faith is the radical acceptance of the mystery that is God." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s theology profoundly shaped twentieth-century Catholic thought, especially through his influence on **Vatican II** and the development of **transcendental theology**. His emphasis on the **mystery of God** and the universal accessibility of grace challenged traditional boundaries and inspired ongoing dialogue between Catholicism and modern philosophy. Rahner’s concepts, particularly the **supernatural existential**, continue to provoke debate regarding the relationship between nature, grace, and the possibility of knowing God.
