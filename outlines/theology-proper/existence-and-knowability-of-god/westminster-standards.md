# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** affirm that the **existence of God** is both a matter of natural revelation and special revelation, insisting that while God's being is evident in creation, true and saving knowledge of Him comes only through **Scripture**. They emphasize the **incomprehensibility** of God, yet maintain that He is **knowable** insofar as He reveals Himself. The Standards thus uphold both the **transcendence** and **immanence** of God in relation to human knowledge.

- "The light of nature sheweth that there is a God; but his word and Spirit only do sufficiently and effectually reveal him unto men for their salvation." (Westminster Confession of Faith 1.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 1, 2, 21)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 1–7)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 1–4)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Evident in Nature**
    - The Standards teach that the **light of nature** reveals the existence of God to all people.
    - Creation and providence manifest God’s **power, wisdom, and goodness**.
    - This natural revelation is sufficient to leave humanity **without excuse**.
    - However, it is insufficient for a saving knowledge of God.
    - "The light of nature, and the works of creation and providence, do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable." (WCF 1.1)

2. **God is Incomprehensible yet Knowable**
    - God’s **essence** cannot be fully comprehended by finite minds.
    - He is **infinite, eternal, and unchangeable** in His being and attributes.
    - Nevertheless, God has truly revealed Himself in ways we can understand.
    - Human knowledge of God is always **analogical** and partial.
    - "God is a Spirit, in and of himself infinite in being, glory, blessedness, and perfection; all-sufficient, eternal, unchangeable, incomprehensible..." (WCF 2.1)

3. **Scripture is Necessary for Saving Knowledge**
    - The Standards assert that **Scripture** is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge of God.
    - The **Word and Spirit** are necessary for effectual revelation.
    - General revelation cannot lead to salvation apart from special revelation.
    - The necessity of Scripture is grounded in the **fallenness** of humanity.
    - "Therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church..." (WCF 1.1)

4. **God’s Attributes are Revealed and Defined by Scripture**
    - The Standards list God’s **attributes** (e.g., wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, truth) as revealed in Scripture.
    - These attributes are not abstract but are known through God’s works and Word.
    - The unity and simplicity of God are emphasized.
    - God’s attributes are not divided or in conflict but harmoniously revealed.
    - "There is but one only, living, and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection..." (WCF 2.1)

5. **Faith is Founded on God’s Self-Revelation**
    - Faith in God’s existence and character is grounded in His **self-revelation**, not human speculation.
    - The Holy Spirit enables understanding and acceptance of God’s revelation.
    - The Standards reject rationalism and skepticism regarding God’s knowability.
    - Assurance of God’s existence and attributes comes through the Spirit’s inward work.
    - "Our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts." (WCF 1.5)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** regarding the existence and knowability of God, providing a balanced doctrine that upholds both the clarity of general revelation and the necessity of special revelation. Their articulation of **God’s incomprehensibility** and the analogical nature of human knowledge of God has influenced generations of theologians. The Standards continue to serve as a doctrinal benchmark for Presbyterian and Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring a robust and confessional approach to the doctrine of God.
