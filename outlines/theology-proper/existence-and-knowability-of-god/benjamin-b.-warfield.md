# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a leading defender of the **existence and knowability of God** within the **Reformed tradition**, emphasizing that true knowledge of God depends on **revelation**. He maintained that while **natural theology** can point to God's existence, only **special revelation**—especially in Scripture—provides saving and personal knowledge of the divine.

- "God is known only so far as He reveals Himself." ("Revelation and Inspiration")

## Key Works

- "Revelation and Inspiration" (in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, vol. 1)
- "The Idea of God and the Moral Proof of His Existence" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Biblical Idea of Revelation" (in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, vol. 1)
- "Calvin and Calvinism" (especially essays on knowledge of God)
- "The Right of Systematic Theology" (in Studies in Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Rationally Defensible**
    - Affirmed that **natural theology** can provide rational arguments for God's existence.
    - Upheld the validity of **theistic proofs** (e.g., cosmological, teleological) as preparatory, not saving.
    - Stressed that reason, though fallen, retains some capacity for apprehending God’s existence.
    - Saw **apologetics** as a legitimate and necessary discipline for defending theism.
    "The proofs of the existence of God are not the grounds of our faith in God, but the logical justification of it." ("The Idea of God and the Moral Proof of His Existence")

2. **Revelation is Essential for True Knowledge of God**
    - Distinguished between **general revelation** (creation, conscience) and **special revelation** (Scripture).
    - Asserted that only special revelation provides knowledge of God as Redeemer.
    - Emphasized the necessity of **Scripture** for a saving and personal relationship with God.
    - Held that revelation is propositional, conveying true knowledge about God.
    "Revelation is the communication of knowledge by God to man." ("Revelation and Inspiration")

3. **Scripture as the Supreme Source of Divine Knowledge**
    - Upheld the **inspiration** and **inerrancy** of Scripture as the foundation for knowing God.
    - Taught that Scripture is the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
    - Asserted that all true knowledge of God must be tested by the biblical witness.
    - Maintained that the **Holy Spirit** enables believers to understand Scripture rightly.
    "The Bible is the Word of God in such a sense that whatever it says, God says." ("Revelation and Inspiration")

4. **Human Reason is Real but Limited**
    - Affirmed the value of reason in apprehending God’s existence and attributes.
    - Recognized the **noetic effects of sin** on human cognition.
    - Insisted that reason must be subordinate to revelation.
    - Saw faith and reason as complementary, not contradictory.
    "Faith is not the child of reason, but reason is the handmaid of faith." ("The Right of Systematic Theology")

5. **The Knowability of God is Both Real and Analogical**
    - Taught that God is truly knowable, though never exhaustively.
    - Emphasized the **Creator-creature distinction** in all knowledge of God.
    - Advocated for **analogical knowledge**: human knowledge corresponds to, but does not equal, divine knowledge.
    - Warned against both agnosticism and rationalism in theology.
    "We know God truly, though not exhaustively; adequately, though not comprehensively." ("The Biblical Idea of Revelation")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **knowability of God** shaped generations of Reformed theologians and apologists, especially within the Princeton tradition. His insistence on the primacy of **revelation** and the authority of Scripture remains foundational for conservative evangelical theology. Warfield’s nuanced approach to **natural theology** and apologetics continues to inform debates on faith and reason, ensuring his ongoing relevance in systematic theology and Christian philosophy.
