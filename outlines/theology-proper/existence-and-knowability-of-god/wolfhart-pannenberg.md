# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **existence and knowability of God** through a historical and eschatological lens, emphasizing the openness of **revelation** and the rational accessibility of God’s reality. He argued that **God’s self-disclosure** occurs in history, culminating in the resurrection of Christ, and that human knowledge of God is possible through critical reflection on these historical events. For Pannenberg, **theology** must remain open to public scrutiny and rational debate, grounding the knowledge of God in universal history rather than private experience.

- "God’s deity is his rule over the world, and his deity is revealed in the history of Jesus." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Key Works

- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Theology and the Philosophy of Science (1976)
- Systematic Theology, Vols. 1–3 (1988–1993)
- Revelation as History (ed., 1968)
- Basic Questions in Theology (3 vols., 1970–1973)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Universal History**
    - God’s self-revelation is not confined to inner experience but is manifested in public, historical events.
    - The resurrection of Jesus is the decisive event in which God’s existence is disclosed.
    - All history is the arena of God’s self-demonstration, accessible to rational inquiry.
    - Revelation is open to verification and critique by all, not just the faith community.
    - "Revelation is not a private event but a public, historical occurrence." (Revelation as History)

2. **Eschatological Verification**
    - The full reality of God will only be disclosed at the end of history.
    - Present knowledge of God is provisional, awaiting eschatological fulfillment.
    - The future is the horizon in which God’s existence and identity are ultimately confirmed.
    - Faith anticipates the final demonstration of God’s reality in the consummation of history.
    - "Only at the end will it be clear who God is." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Rational Knowability of God**
    - Knowledge of God is possible through critical, rational engagement with historical events.
    - Theology must be open to the standards of public reason and argument.
    - The existence of God is not a presupposition but a conclusion drawn from the interpretation of history.
    - Theological claims must be subject to interdisciplinary dialogue and critique.
    - "The question of God is a question for reason, not just for faith." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

4. **Rejection of Subjectivism**
    - Pannenberg opposes grounding knowledge of God in existential or mystical experience.
    - He insists on the objectivity of revelation in history rather than private consciousness.
    - The truth of God is not dependent on individual faith but on public events.
    - Theology must avoid fideism and engage with the broader intellectual world.
    - "Faith is not the basis but the result of the revelation of God in history." (Jesus—God and Man)

5. **God’s Deity as Sovereignty in History**
    - God’s existence is inseparable from his sovereign action in the world.
    - The deity of God is revealed through his lordship over history, especially in Christ.
    - God’s being is dynamic, defined by his acts rather than static essence.
    - The knowability of God is tied to his active engagement with creation.
    - "God’s deity is his rule over the world, and his deity is revealed in the history of Jesus." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to the **existence and knowability of God** has significantly shaped modern theology by insisting on the public, historical, and rational character of **revelation**. His emphasis on eschatology and the openness of theology to interdisciplinary critique challenged both existentialist and neo-orthodox trends. Pannenberg’s work continues to influence discussions on the relationship between **faith and reason**, and his insistence on the historical grounding of theology remains a vital reference point in contemporary debates.
