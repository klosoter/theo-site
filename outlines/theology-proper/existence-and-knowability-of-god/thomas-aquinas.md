# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas argued that the **existence and knowability of God** can be established through **natural reason** as well as **divine revelation**. He maintained that while God's **essence** surpasses human comprehension, certain truths about God—such as His existence—are accessible through **philosophical demonstration** and the observation of the created order.

- "We cannot know what God is, but only what He is not; we must therefore consider the ways in which God does not exist, rather than the ways in which He does." (Summa Theologiae I, q.3, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I, qq. 2–13)
- Summa Contra Gentiles (Book I)
- De Veritate (On Truth)
- Commentary on Boethius’s De Trinitate
- On Being and Essence (De Ente et Essentia)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Demonstrable by Reason**
    - Aquinas holds that the **existence of God** can be proven through rational arguments, notably the **Five Ways**.
    - He distinguishes between truths accessible to **natural reason** and those known only by **revelation**.
    - The **cosmological** and **teleological** arguments are central to his approach.
    - These demonstrations do not reveal God's essence, but establish that He exists.
    - "The existence of God and other like truths about God, which can be known by natural reason, are not articles of faith but are preambles to the articles." (Summa Theologiae I, q.2, a.2)

2. **Analogy of Being (Analogia Entis)**
    - Human language about God is neither purely **univocal** nor **equivocal**, but **analogical**.
    - Analogy allows for meaningful, though limited, predication about God.
    - This preserves both **divine transcendence** and the possibility of true knowledge.
    - It guards against both rationalism and agnosticism.
    - "Because we cannot know what God is, but rather what He is not, we have no means for considering how God is, but rather how He is not." (Summa Theologiae I, q.3, a.1)

3. **Distinction Between Essence and Existence**
    - In all creatures, **essence** and **existence** are distinct; in God, they are identical.
    - This distinction undergirds Aquinas’s argument for God’s **absolute simplicity**.
    - It explains why God alone is **necessary being**.
    - Human knowledge of God is always limited by this metaphysical distinction.
    - "In God, essence and existence are one and the same." (De Ente et Essentia, ch. 4)

4. **Negative (Apophatic) Theology**
    - Aquinas emphasizes that we know God more by what He is not than by what He is.
    - This approach protects the **incomprehensibility** and **transcendence** of God.
    - It leads to the use of **negative predicates** (e.g., infinite, immutable).
    - Positive statements about God are always qualified by negation.
    - "We cannot know what God is, but only what He is not." (Summa Theologiae I, q.3, a.1)

5. **Faith and Reason are Harmonious**
    - Aquinas asserts that **faith** and **reason** are distinct but never in true conflict.
    - Reason prepares for and supports faith, especially in the **preambula fidei**.
    - Some truths about God (e.g., Trinity) exceed reason and require **revelation**.
    - The harmony of faith and reason reflects the unity of **truth**.
    - "Since faith rests upon infallible truth, and since the contrary of a truth can never be demonstrated, it is clear that the articles of faith cannot be demonstrated by reason." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **natural theology** and **Christian doctrine** became foundational for both Roman Catholic and broader Christian thought on the **existence and knowability of God**. His **Five Ways** remain a central reference point in philosophical theology, and his distinction between **essence and existence** shaped later metaphysics. Aquinas’s method of harmonizing faith and reason continues to influence contemporary discussions on the relationship between philosophy and theology. His analogical approach to divine language set enduring parameters for how theologians speak of God’s transcendence and immanence.
