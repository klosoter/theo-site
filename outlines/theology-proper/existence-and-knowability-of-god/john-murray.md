# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray maintained that the **existence and knowability of God** are foundational to **Reformed theology**, insisting that God reveals Himself through both **general revelation** in creation and **special revelation** in Scripture. He argued that while human knowledge of God is always analogical and dependent on divine initiative, it is nonetheless true, objective, and sufficient for faith and obedience.

- "God has not left himself without witness in the world, and the knowledge of God is inescapable." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Nature and Authority of Scripture" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (especially commentary on Romans 1:18–21)
- "Calvin on Scripture and Divine Sovereignty"
- "The Covenant of Grace" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Self-Evident in Creation**
    - The created order bears clear testimony to the reality of God.
    - All people possess an innate awareness of God due to **general revelation**.
    - Suppression of this knowledge is a result of human sin, not divine obscurity.
    - The **natural knowledge of God** leaves humanity without excuse.
    "The evidence for God’s existence is so manifest in creation that unbelief is inexcusable." (Romans, Vol. 1)

2. **Knowledge of God is Analogical and Covenantal**
    - Human knowledge of God is real but always analogical, not univocal.
    - God accommodates His revelation to human capacity.
    - True knowledge of God is possible only within the context of **covenant relationship**.
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** governs all theological knowledge.
    "Our knowledge is never comprehensive, but it is true and covenantally grounded." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Special Revelation is Necessary for Saving Knowledge**
    - **General revelation** is insufficient for salvation due to human sinfulness.
    - **Special revelation** in Scripture is required for a redemptive knowledge of God.
    - The **Word of God** is the definitive self-disclosure of God’s character and will.
    - Faith is grounded in God’s authoritative revelation, not human speculation.
    "The Scriptures are the only infallible rule of faith and practice." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

4. **The Noetic Effects of Sin**
    - Sin profoundly affects human cognition and perception of God.
    - Fallen humanity distorts and suppresses the knowledge of God available in creation.
    - Regeneration is necessary to restore true knowledge of God.
    - The **Holy Spirit** illumines the mind to receive and understand divine revelation.
    "Sin blinds the mind and heart to the glory of God revealed in both nature and Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **The Objectivity and Sufficiency of Divine Revelation**
    - God’s revelation is objective and not dependent on human response for its validity.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of revelation ensure that God can be truly known.
    - The authority of revelation rests in God Himself, not in human interpretation.
    - The **self-authenticating** nature of Scripture guarantees its reliability.
    "Revelation is God’s act and bears its own authentication." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of the **existence and knowability of God** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. His careful distinction between **general and special revelation**, and his analysis of the noetic effects of sin, continue to inform contemporary discussions on **epistemology** and **revelation**. Murray’s emphasis on the sufficiency and objectivity of Scripture remains a hallmark of confessional Reformed theology.
