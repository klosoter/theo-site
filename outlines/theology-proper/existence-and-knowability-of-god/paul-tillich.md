# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **existence and knowability of God** through the lens of **philosophical theology**, emphasizing God as the **"Ground of Being"** rather than a being among beings. He rejected traditional proofs for God's existence, arguing instead that God is **beyond essence and existence**, and that knowledge of God is mediated through **symbols** and **revelation** within human experience.

- "God does not exist. He is being-itself beyond essence and existence." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 1")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially Part I: Reason and Revelation, Being and God)
- The Courage to Be
- Dynamics of Faith
- Theology of Culture
- The Shaking of the Foundations

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as the Ground of Being**
    - God is not a being among beings, but the basis for all existence.
    - The divine is "beyond essence and existence," transcending all finite categories.
    - Human language about God is necessarily symbolic and analogical.
    - This view rejects both classical theism and atheism as misunderstandings of the divine.
    - "He is being-itself, or the ground of being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Rejection of Traditional Theistic Proofs**
    - Classical arguments for God's existence are seen as inadequate and misleading.
    - Proofs treat God as an object within the realm of finite existence.
    - Tillich insists that God cannot be subject to empirical or rational demonstration.
    - Faith is an existential response to the depth of reality, not assent to propositions.
    - "The question of existence does not apply to God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Symbolic Knowledge of God**
    - All knowledge of God is mediated through symbols that participate in the reality they signify.
    - Symbols are necessary because literal language cannot capture the divine mystery.
    - Religious symbols arise from collective human experience and are historically conditioned.
    - Symbols open up levels of reality otherwise inaccessible to empirical knowledge.
    - "Symbol is the only way in which the divine can be expressed." (Dynamics of Faith)

4. **Revelation as Ecstatic Experience**
    - Revelation is not propositional but occurs as an existential encounter with the divine.
    - It is mediated through history, culture, and personal experience.
    - Revelation transcends ordinary knowledge and transforms the subject.
    - The content of revelation is always interpreted through symbolic forms.
    - "Revelation is the manifestation of the ground of being for human knowledge." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Correlation of Faith and Reason**
    - Theology must correlate existential human questions with answers from revelation.
    - Reason and faith are not opposed but interdependent in the search for ultimate meaning.
    - The method of correlation allows theology to remain relevant to contemporary culture.
    - Human finitude and anxiety drive the quest for the ultimate, which is answered by the divine.
    - "The method of correlation explains the contents of the Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich's approach to the **existence and knowability of God** profoundly shaped twentieth-century **philosophical theology** and **existentialist thought**. His emphasis on God as the "Ground of Being" challenged both classical theism and modern atheism, influencing later discussions on the limits of religious language and the nature of faith. Tillich’s method of correlation continues to inform contemporary theology’s engagement with culture, philosophy, and the sciences. His work remains a touchstone for debates on the symbolic and existential dimensions of religious knowledge.
