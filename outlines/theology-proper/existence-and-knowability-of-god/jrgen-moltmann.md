# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann grounds the **existence and knowability of God** in **eschatological revelation** and the **self-disclosure of God in history**, especially through the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. He rejects classical **natural theology**, insisting that true knowledge of God comes from **God’s initiative in revelation**, mediated through history, suffering, and hope.

- "God is not recognized by means of proofs, but through his revelation in the history of Jesus Christ." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- God in Creation (1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Eschatological**
    - God is known as the One who promises and fulfills in **history**.
    - Knowledge of God is oriented toward the future and rooted in **hope**.
    - Revelation unfolds dynamically in the movement of history.
    - The resurrection is the decisive event for knowing God.
    - "God reveals himself in the raising of the crucified Christ, and in this revelation he opens up the future of his own reality." (Theology of Hope)

2. **God’s Knowability is Christocentric**
    - Jesus Christ is the primary locus of God’s **self-revelation**.
    - The cross and resurrection are central to understanding who God is.
    - Knowledge of God is inseparable from the person and work of Christ.
    - The suffering of Christ reveals God’s solidarity with humanity.
    - "The knowledge of God is bound up with the history of Jesus, and with the hope that arises from it." (The Crucified God)

3. **Rejection of Classical Natural Theology**
    - Moltmann critiques attempts to prove God’s existence through reason alone.
    - God is not an abstract metaphysical principle but is encountered in **history**.
    - Knowledge of God cannot be separated from God’s acts in history.
    - Faith, not rational deduction, is the proper response to God’s revelation.
    - "God is not an object of human knowledge, but the subject who makes himself known." (Experiences in Theology)

4. **Trinitarian Relationality**
    - God is known in the dynamic relations of **Father, Son, and Spirit**.
    - The Trinity is not speculative but the reality of God’s self-giving.
    - Knowledge of God is participatory, involving believers in God’s life.
    - The Spirit mediates the presence and knowledge of God in the world.
    - "The trinitarian history of God is the basis for the knowability of God in the world." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

5. **Knowledge of God Through Suffering and Hope**
    - God is revealed in the midst of human suffering and the struggle for justice.
    - The cross is the paradigm for understanding God’s presence in the world.
    - Hope in God’s future transforms how believers know and experience God now.
    - Knowledge of God is inseparable from the praxis of hope and liberation.
    - "God is to be found in the fellowship of the crucified, and in the hope of the resurrection." (The Crucified God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of the **knowability of God**, especially by centering revelation in **history, suffering, and eschatological hope**. His rejection of **natural theology** and emphasis on the **Trinitarian** and **Christocentric** nature of revelation have influenced liberation, political, and post-Holocaust theologies. Moltmann’s work continues to challenge theologians to consider how God is known in the context of human suffering and the promise of future transformation.
