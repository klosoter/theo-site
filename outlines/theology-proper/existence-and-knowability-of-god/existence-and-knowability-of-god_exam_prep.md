### ESSAY
The topic concerns two intimately related claims: that God exists and that God is knowable. The first asserts a metaphysical reality, the second a noetic possibility. Within Christian confession, these are framed by a pair of axioms: the Creator–creature distinction and **divine incomprehensibility**. God is not an item among beings but the simple, triune Creator whose act of being grounds all else. Consequently, any true creaturely knowledge of God must be **analogical knowledge**. It is neither univocal, as if God and creature shared the same mode of being, nor merely equivocal, which would destroy meaningful predication. The issue, therefore, is not whether human beings can comprehend God in se, which they cannot, but whether under God’s self-disclosure through **general revelation** and **special revelation** they may know God truly. That answer is yes: creatures can know the existence of God by his works and word, and because the God who is light freely accommodates himself to us. If the divine life is perfect act and **divine simplicity** holds, then God is not carved up into accessible parts for finite minds to grasp, yet God’s coherent perfections are meaningfully signified in creaturely concepts according to analogical proportion. The challenge is to defend this without collapsing into naturalistic rationalism on one side or apophatic obscurantism on the other.

Thomas Aquinas stands as the classical architect of this terrain. Writing in the Summa Theologiae and Summa contra Gentiles, Aquinas argues that God’s existence is not self-evident to us although it is self-evident in itself, since we do not have direct access to the divine essence. He therefore advances demonstrations from effects to cause. These are not probabilistic inductions but metaphysical regress arguments that terminate in a first cause proportionate to the effect’s act of being. Motion requires a prime unmoved mover, efficient causality a first efficient cause, contingency a necessary being, gradation a source of perfection, and teleology an ordering intellect. These ways are diverse deployments of one animating insight: the world’s act-potency structure and ordered dependence signal a transcendent source of actuality. Aquinas simultaneously guards **incomprehensibility**. Our concepts do not contain God as he is; names apply to God by analogy of attribution and proportionality. Because of **divine simplicity**, God’s wisdom is God’s being, yet the terms wise or good, though drawn from creaturely perfections, signify truly of God without implying composition. Aquinas’s method integrates **general revelation** read metaphysically with **analogical knowledge**, which preserves mystery without surrendering reason. His position reshaped Western Christian discourse by legitimating a disciplined **natural theology** that is neither autonomous nor arbitrary. He insists that demonstrations are ministerial to faith and that special revelation corrects and consummates natural knowledge. Against the fear that analogia entis erodes the Creator–creature distance, Aquinas’s analogical predication presupposes that distance and avoids univocity’s domestication of God. Against the charge that his proofs assume an Aristotelian cosmos, the core of the ways does not rely on a static physics but on act and potency, which remain cogent under contemporary accounts of change, causation, and the contingency of the cosmos.

Cornelius Van Til, formed in early twentieth-century Reformed polemics and the founding of Westminster Theological Seminary, radicalized the Creator–creature distinction into a **covenantal epistemology**. His thesis is that all facts are God-interpreted facts, and thus all knowledge is either obedient or rebellious. The noetic effects of sin are not marginal; they are suppressive and covenantally decisive. Van Til rejects a neutral, autonomous **natural theology** in which human reason pretends independence from revelation. Instead, he recasts theistic argument as transcendental, arguing for the truth of Christian theism as the necessary precondition for the intelligibility of experience. This argument from the impossibility of the contrary presses deeper than evidential correlation by asking what worldview conditions must be met for logic, science, morality, and personal identity to be meaningful. That requires the triune God whose self-contained fullness grants unity and diversity, whose **divine simplicity** grounds coherence, and whose covenantal governance provides order and normativity. Van Til does not deny **general revelation**; he insists on it. What he denies is that fallen reason can interpret revelation aright apart from **special revelation** and regeneration. He does not discard the classical theistic proofs; rather, he transforms them into transcendental instantiations that presuppose the Christian God at every step instead of treating God as a hypothesis among others. Under pressure from examiners, one must be precise: Van Til is not arguing in a vicious circle but in a necessary circle. Every ultimate authority claim must refer to itself to be ultimate. The question is whether circularity is virtuous and revelationally grounded or vicious and self-contradictory. Van Til’s place is decisive because he reframed the epistemology of theology around **analogical knowledge** and covenant, thereby resisting both rationalistic natural theology and Barthian disallowance of nature’s witness.

Between these two figures stands John Calvin, whose Institutes provides the spiritual-epistemic grammar of Reformed Christian knowledge. Calvin asserts a universal **sensus divinitatis**, a seed of religion implanted by God, and reads the world as a theater of God’s glory. This is robust **general revelation**, not deist abstraction. The knowledge it yields is genuine, yet in light of sin, it becomes an occasion for idolatry. Thus we need the spectacles of Scripture to read creation aright and to know God not only as Creator but as Redeemer in Christ. Calvin’s conception integrates metaphysical and moral knowledge. God’s existence is evident in the structure of creation and conscience. But without the illumination of the Spirit, humans distort that knowledge. His distinction between the knowledge of God the Creator and the knowledge of God the Redeemer shows why **natural theology** is strictly limited and why **special revelation** defines theology’s center. When examiners press whether Calvin permits theistic proofs, the answer is that he sees signs everywhere and arguments may have use, but they lack power to produce saving knowledge and cannot compel the obstinate. He anticipates modern debates by placing warrant not in autonomous rational alignment but in the Spirit’s work conjoining word and world. Calvin thereby guards both **incomprehensibility** and genuine accessibility by locating knowledge within God’s economy of grace.

A decisive external challenge comes from Immanuel Kant. By cordoning off theoretical reason to the domain of phenomena, Kant deems God unknowable by speculative metaphysics. God, freedom, and immortality are postulates of practical reason, necessary for moral coherence, not objects of theoretical demonstration. The antinomies of reason reveal the contradictions that arise when thought overreaches. Kant’s critical turn either forces theology into ethics or into an existential posture that surrenders metaphysical nerve. Kant also undermines classical **analogical knowledge**, which presupposes participation in being, by denying knowledge of things as they are in themselves. His impact was enormous: he catalyzed a tradition of Protestant reticence about metaphysical claims and a methodological suspicion of **natural theology**. Yet Kant’s conditions are themselves metaphysical posits, and his self-limitation of reason cannot be established without using the very capacities he restricts. Moreover, if knowledge is limited to the phenomenal, the claim that God is unknowable is itself unknowable or trivial. Kant rightly cautions against rational hubris, a lesson not foreign to Christian **incomprehensibility**, but he mistakenly replaces limits of creaturely analogy with a principled agnosticism about God’s existence and nature that Scripture and the created order do not bear.

Karl Barth responded to the liberal inheritance shaped by Kant by re-centering theology on revelation in Jesus Christ. He famously rejected an autonomous **natural theology**, denouncing the analogia entis as a pathway to idolatry. Revelation is self-disclosure, not the result of an upward climb. Barth’s analogia fidei is epistemic humility writ large. His debate with Emil Brunner over nature and grace turned on whether **general revelation** has theological weight. Barth feared that any appeal to nature would domesticate Christ and dull the radicality of grace. We should grant Barth’s insight that knowledge of God is God’s gift and that Christ is the definitive revelation. Yet to deny the integrity of **general revelation** is to deny both Scripture’s testimony and the Creator’s faithfulness to the works of his hands. Barth’s position risks making revelation wholly incommensurable with creation, fraying the unity of God’s works ad extra. Examined with Westminster rigor, the problem is not whether God is known in Christ but whether the God known in Christ is the same Creator who left witness in the world. The Reformed tradition affirms both, while ranking them according to their covenantal roles.

In contemporary analytic philosophy of religion, Alvin Plantinga resurrected and retooled Calvin’s **sensus divinitatis** into a robust account of warranted belief. Belief in God can be properly basic, rational apart from evidence or argument, provided it arises from cognitive faculties functioning properly in an appropriate epistemic environment according to a design plan successfully aimed at truth. This undercuts classical evidentialism that demanded demonstrative or probabilistic arguments for rationality. Plantinga strengthens the position by showing that proposed defeaters, such as the problem of evil or the diversity of religions, do not invariably defeat theistic belief and that naturalism suffers from a defeater of its own in the evolutionary argument against naturalism. One should integrate Plantinga with Van Til by noting that proper basicality stands within a **covenantal epistemology**. The design plan is not generic but divine. The Spirit’s internal witness, so emphasized by Calvin, fits as the chief instance of properly basic theistic knowledge. Plantinga’s approach honors **analogical knowledge** by resisting univocal criteria of rationality imposed from outside theism. Yet Plantinga does not, and should not, bar arguments. He distinguishes the de jure claim that belief in God is rational from the de facto question of whether God exists, leaving plenty of room for metaphysical demonstrations. Coupled with the best contemporary versions of the cosmological argument, modal ontological arguments, and fine-tuning from cosmic order, the analytic scene shows that theistic belief is not only rational but evidentially buoyed, while not being hostage to evidentialist strictures.

With these figures in hand, we can state and defend a position. God exists as the simple triune Creator, and he is knowable truly though not comprehensively. Knowledge of God is analogical and covenantal. **General revelation** discloses God in creation and conscience, rendering humanity without excuse, while **special revelation** grants saving knowledge and rectifies suppressed natural knowledge. **Natural theology** is legitimate and fruitful when it is ministerial, governed by Scripture, and conducted under the discipline of **analogical knowledge**. Theistic arguments, far from denying the noetic effects of sin, serve to expose suppression and to display the rationality of faith before God and neighbor. Such arguments must not be framed as neutral or autonomous but as unpacking the implications of the world as God’s world.

Internal debates require careful navigation. Within classical theism, the question of how **incomprehensibility** is compatible with predication is answered analogically. We do not know what God is according to essence, but we know who God is by his names revealed and effects manifested. Against univocity, which risks shrinking God to creaturely categories, and against equivocity, which makes talk of God meaningless, **analogical knowledge** secures true predication grounded in God’s causal primacy and revelatory self-naming. Within the Reformed tradition, disputes over theistic proofs turn on their location. When evidentialists treat them as neutral levers moving independent rational agents to God, they fetishize fallen reason. When presuppositionalists refuse any inferential articulation, they risk anti-intellectualism. The right course is Van Til’s transformed proofs, construed as covenantally situated and theologically thick. On the Barth–Brunner divide, we affirm with Calvin that there is a seed of religion and a public testimony in the works of God, but we warn that only the gospel heals misuse. Examiners will ask whether this collapses nature into grace. The answer is that grace restores and elevates nature without erasing its integrity. Nature remains a genuine mode of divine self-disclosure that carries real, condemnatory, and invitational force, but grace is required for right interpretation and saving communion.

External debates sharpen our case. Kant’s agnosticism revives the ancient apophatic temptation but as a principled outcome of his philosophy of mind. We answer that Kant’s phenomenalism cuts off knowledge of God only if we accept his premises, which are neither self-evident nor unassailable. The unity and necessity of logical laws, the purposiveness of reason, and the very structure of moral obligation fit better in a theistic metaphysic. Hume’s skepticism concerning causation and induction can be answered by pointing out that a world whose regularities are contingent cries out for explanation, and that the Christian doctrine of providence supplies a metaphysical ground for the uniformity of nature in a way secular accounts fail to do. The charge that presuppositionalism is circular mistakes transcendental necessity for fallacious reasoning and ignores that every ultimate criterion either is arbitrarily asserted or reflexively affirmed. We choose the latter, and we do so within Scripture’s covenantal frame.

Contemporary debates expose stress points we should address head on. The argument from **divine hiddenness** asserts that a loving God would make his existence more obviously apparent to nonresistant seekers. But **general revelation** is clear and constant, and the heart’s posture is never neutral. Moreover, God’s purpose is not bare acknowledgment of existence but covenantal communion. God veils and unveils in judgments and mercies suited to redemptive history and the purposes of patience and repentance. Cognitive science of religion claims that belief in God is an evolutionary byproduct of hyperactive agency detection. This does not defeat theism. Natural faculties producing belief do not require falsity; they may be aimed at truth. Under theistic design, such faculties are expected. The evolutionary explanation is at best a counter-story; it is not a defeater unless conjoined to naturalism. Plantinga’s evolutionary argument against naturalism undercuts that conjunction by revealing a defeater for trusting our cognitive faculties if naturalism and unguided evolution are true. Fine-tuning of cosmic constants, while not a demonstration, is best explained by a wise designer. Modal ontological reasoning clarifies that if a maximally great being is possible, such a being exists in every possible world, including the actual world. These do not replace **analogical knowledge**; they work within it, expanding inferential understanding without discarding mystery.

The doctrine’s coherence with adjacent loci is plain. **Divine simplicity** informs **analogical knowledge** by reminding us that God’s attributes are not separable parts. Our concepts are many, God is one. **Incomprehensibility** is not ignorance but the affirmation that the mode of God’s being outstrips our mode of knowing. Trinitarian theology matters because the God whose existence we affirm is not a generic monad but the Father, Son, and Spirit whose shared essence and personal distinctions ground the metaphysical intelligibility of unity and diversity. Anthropology and hamartiology shape the noetic landscape: humans are image bearers with a natural desire for God, yet sin disorders desire and cognition. Soteriology clarifies that redemptive illumination reorders reason and affections, fulfilling rather than negating nature. The doctrine of Scripture anchors knowledge, for Scripture is the covenant document of **special revelation**, God-breathed and authoritative, by which church and world are called to know God truly.

Objections often seek to pry apart these layers. Some charge that **divine simplicity** renders God so utterly other that predication fails. But simplicity is the ground of predication, not its negation. Because God is pure act, there are no latent potencies that would frustrate our analogical attributions. Another objection says that admitting demonstrative arguments for God puts reason in the driver’s seat. We answer that in a rightly ordered epistemology, reason is a minister, not a magister. God’s existence is not contingent on our arguments; our arguments are responses to God’s already revealed reality. Others fear that Van Til’s transcendental argument is too vague to convince anyone. Its force is cumulative and dialogical, inviting the interlocutor to test whether his or her worldview can account for the very tools of critique being used. If rationality, morality, and meaning are explicable only by borrowing capital from the Christian worldview, the argument’s force is seen. Examiners may ask whether the analogia entis is compatible with Reformed theology. If by analogia entis one means univocal sameness of being, the answer is no. If one means analogical predication grounded in God’s causal transcendence and self-revelation, the answer is yes, provided it is tethered to Scripture and confessional commitments. On Barth’s dictum that the analogia entis is the invention of the antichrist, the correct Reformed reply distinguishes a problematic natural theology of autonomous ascent from an ordered acknowledgment of God’s works.

Finally, the positive case can be succinctly stated. The world is an effect bearing the imprint of its cause. Contingent beings exist; they cannot be their own sufficient reason. There is order and teleology disproportionate to blind chance. Moral law has an authority that outstrips social contract. Rational inquiry presupposes a world that is intelligible and minds that are truth-aimed. These features are neither brute nor self-explanatory. They are signs of the triune God whose existence is not an hypothesis but the very condition of possibility for creaturely being, knowing, and willing. When situated within **analogical knowledge** and a **covenantal epistemology**, these signs can be gathered into arguments that are both formally cogent and spiritually searching. They do not save. Only the gospel saves. But they clarify that believing in God is not a leap into darkness but a step into the light that has already been shining.

What is demanded in an oral defense at Westminster is a disciplined posture. One must affirm **incomprehensibility** and true knowledge without contradiction, defend **general revelation** and **special revelation** in their covenantal order, refuse both autonomous rationalism and fideistic retreat, and show familiarity with Aquinas’s metaphysics, Calvin’s spiritual epistemology, Van Til’s transcendental critique, Kant’s challenge, Barth’s protest, and Plantinga’s analytic rehabilitation. The position defended does not gather these voices as a bland synthesis. It subordinates them to Scripture’s own ordering and receives from each what serves the architecture of Christian confession. Theology begins and ends in the doxological acknowledgment that God is, that he has spoken, and that in his light we see light.
