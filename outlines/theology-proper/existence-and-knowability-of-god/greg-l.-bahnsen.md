# Greg Bahnsen (1948–1995)

Greg Bahnsen was a leading advocate of **presuppositional apologetics**, emphasizing that the **existence and knowability of God** are foundational to all human reasoning. He argued that all knowledge presupposes the **self-revelation of the Triune God** in **Scripture**, and that **autonomous human reason** cannot provide a sufficient ground for knowledge of God or anything else.

- "The Christian worldview alone provides the necessary preconditions for the intelligibility of human experience." (Always Ready)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is the Necessary Foundation for Knowledge**
    - All human reasoning presupposes the existence of the **Triune God**.
    - Denial of God leads to epistemological futility and irrationality.
    - The impossibility of the contrary: only the Christian worldview makes knowledge possible.
    - The **ontological Trinity** is necessary for the unity and diversity in reality.
    - "The proof of God’s existence is that without Him it is impossible to prove anything." (Van Til’s Apologetic)

2. **Revelation is the Basis for the Knowability of God**
    - God has revealed Himself both in **general** and **special revelation**.
    - Knowledge of God is possible only because God has made Himself known.
    - Scripture is the ultimate, self-authenticating authority for knowledge of God.
    - Human beings are created with the **imago Dei**, enabling true (though limited) knowledge of God.
    - "God’s revelation is the necessary foundation for all human knowledge." (Always Ready)

3. **Presuppositional Methodology**
    - All worldviews are built on basic presuppositions that shape interpretation of facts.
    - The Christian must challenge the unbeliever’s presuppositions, exposing their inability to account for knowledge.
    - Neutrality in reasoning is impossible; everyone operates from faith commitments.
    - Apologetics is a conflict of worldviews, not merely of evidences.
    - "There is no neutrality; all reasoning is either for or against Christ." (Always Ready)

4. **Antithesis Between Belief and Unbelief**
    - There is a fundamental opposition between the Christian and non-Christian mind.
    - Unbelievers suppress the truth of God in unrighteousness (Romans 1).
    - The **noetic effects of sin** distort the unbeliever’s reasoning and knowledge of God.
    - Only regeneration and the Holy Spirit’s work overcome this antithesis.
    - "The antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought is total and all-encompassing." (Van Til’s Apologetic)

5. **Transcendental Argument for God’s Existence**
    - The existence of God is demonstrated by the impossibility of the contrary.
    - The transcendental argument shows that logic, morality, and science presuppose God.
    - The unbeliever’s worldview cannot account for the preconditions of intelligibility.
    - The Christian worldview alone provides a coherent basis for knowledge and rationality.
    - "The transcendental argument seeks to prove that the Christian worldview is the necessary foundation for all reasoning." (Always Ready)

## Legacy and Impact

Bahnsen’s rigorous defense of **presuppositional apologetics** has profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to the **existence and knowability of God**. His debates and writings clarified and popularized Cornelius Van Til’s thought, equipping a generation of apologists to challenge secular and non-Christian worldviews. Bahnsen’s insistence on the **impossibility of neutrality** and the necessity of **revelation** continues to influence contemporary discussions in apologetics and epistemology.
