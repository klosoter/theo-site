# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine grounds the **existence and knowability of God** in both **natural revelation** and the **illumination of the mind** by God Himself. He affirms that while God's existence is evident through creation, true knowledge of God requires divine aid, as human reason is limited and affected by sin.

- "You have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you." (Confessions)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- De Doctrina Christiana (On Christian Doctrine)
- Enchiridion

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Self-Evident in Creation**
    - The created order reflects the **divine attributes** and points to its Creator.
    - Human beings have an innate sense of the divine, a **restless heart** seeking God.
    - The beauty and order of the world serve as signs of God's existence.
    - Reason can perceive God’s existence, but only dimly without grace.
    - "And if they find delight in the beauty of material things, let them praise God for them." (Confessions)

2. **Knowledge of God Requires Divine Illumination**
    - Human minds are darkened by sin and need **illumination** from God to truly know Him.
    - Divine light enables the intellect to grasp eternal truths.
    - Faith and reason work together, but faith precedes full understanding.
    - The **inner teacher** (Christ) is necessary for genuine knowledge of God.
    - "No one can know the truth unless he is enlightened by God." (De Magistro)

3. **Faith Seeking Understanding**
    - **Faith** is the foundation for all true knowledge of God.
    - Understanding grows as faith seeks deeper insight.
    - The act of believing is itself a gift from God.
    - Theological inquiry is always subordinate to the authority of faith.
    - "I believe in order to understand; and I understand, the better to believe." (Sermons)

4. **Limits of Human Reason**
    - Human reason is finite and cannot fully comprehend the **divine essence**.
    - Mystery is inherent in the knowledge of God.
    - Reason can point toward God but cannot exhaustively define Him.
    - Humility is essential in theological reflection.
    - "If you understood him, it would not be God." (Sermon 52)

5. **Analogy and Negative Theology**
    - God is known through **analogical language**, not univocally.
    - Negative theology (via negativa) emphasizes what God is not, to avoid idolatry.
    - Affirmations about God are always limited by human language.
    - The **Trinity** is known by analogy to human mind, but remains ultimately mysterious.
    - "We are speaking of God; what marvel if you do not comprehend?" (De Trinitate)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s approach to the **existence and knowability of God** shaped both Western and Reformed theology, especially in the doctrines of **natural revelation** and **divine illumination**. His emphasis on the necessity of grace for true knowledge influenced later thinkers such as Anselm and Calvin. Augustine’s integration of faith and reason continues to inform discussions on epistemology and the limits of human understanding in theology.
