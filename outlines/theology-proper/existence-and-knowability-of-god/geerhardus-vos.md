# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos affirmed the **existence and knowability of God** as foundational to all theology, emphasizing that God is both **transcendent** and **immanent** in His revelation. He insisted that true knowledge of God is possible only through **special revelation**, culminating in **Scripture** and ultimately in **Christ**, while also recognizing the role of **general revelation** in nature and conscience.

- "God is knowable because He has willed to make Himself known, and this knowledge is mediated through revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "The Doctrine of Revelation in the History of Dogmatics" (article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Self-Evident in Revelation**
    - God’s existence is not established by human reason but is presupposed in all revelation.
    - Both **general** and **special revelation** testify to God’s being.
    - The sense of the divine (sensus divinitatis) is innate in humanity.
    - Scripture assumes, rather than argues for, God’s existence.
    - "Scripture nowhere seeks to prove the existence of God; it everywhere assumes it." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Knowability of God is Dependent on Divine Initiative**
    - Human knowledge of God is possible only because God chooses to reveal Himself.
    - Revelation is both **objective** (in history and Scripture) and **subjective** (illumined by the Spirit).
    - God remains incomprehensible in essence, yet truly knowable in His acts and words.
    - The **covenant** is the framework for God’s self-disclosure.
    - "The knowledge of God is a gift of grace, not a product of autonomous reason." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Distinction Between Archetypal and Ectypal Knowledge**
    - Only God possesses **archetypal** (original, perfect) knowledge of Himself.
    - Human knowledge is **ectypal**—a finite, analogical participation in God’s self-knowledge.
    - This distinction safeguards both God’s transcendence and the reality of human knowledge.
    - The analogical nature of knowledge is rooted in the Creator-creature distinction.
    - "Our knowledge of God is a finite replica of the infinite knowledge God has of Himself." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

4. **Revelation is Progressive and Redemptive**
    - God’s self-disclosure unfolds progressively throughout redemptive history.
    - **Biblical theology** traces the organic development of revelation from promise to fulfillment.
    - The climax of revelation is in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
    - Special revelation is necessary for saving knowledge of God.
    - "Revelation is not static, but advances with the unfolding of redemption." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Scripture as the Normative Medium of Revelation**
    - The **Bible** is the authoritative and sufficient record of God’s special revelation.
    - Scripture provides the only infallible rule for knowing God truly.
    - The Spirit’s illumination is necessary for rightly apprehending God’s self-revelation in Scripture.
    - All theological knowledge must be grounded in and normed by Scripture.
    - "The Scriptures are the means by which the knowledge of God is preserved and transmitted." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust articulation of the **existence and knowability of God** shaped twentieth-century Reformed theology, especially in the areas of **revelation** and **biblical theology**. His distinction between **archetypal** and **ectypal** knowledge influenced later theologians’ understanding of the Creator-creature relationship. Vos’s emphasis on the progressive, redemptive nature of revelation continues to inform contemporary discussions on the doctrine of God and the interpretation of Scripture.
