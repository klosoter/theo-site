# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirmed the **existence and knowability of God** as foundational to all theology, grounding this knowledge in both **general revelation** (creation) and **special revelation** (Scripture). He emphasized the **sensus divinitatis**—an innate sense of the divine in all humans—while also insisting that true and saving knowledge of God is only possible through the **self-disclosure of God** in Christ and the Scriptures.

- "There is within the human mind, and indeed by natural instinct, an awareness of divinity." (Institutes I.3.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I)
- Commentary on Genesis
- Commentary on the Psalms
- Sermons on Job

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Universal Knowledge of God through General Revelation**
    - All people possess an innate **awareness of God** due to the **sensus divinitatis**.
    - Creation itself testifies to God's existence and attributes.
    - This knowledge renders all humanity **without excuse** before God.
    - The clarity of general revelation is suppressed by human sinfulness.
    - "Men cannot open their eyes without being compelled to see him." (Institutes I.5.1)

2. **Necessity of Special Revelation for Saving Knowledge**
    - While general revelation reveals God's existence, it is insufficient for salvation.
    - **Scripture** is necessary to know God rightly and to understand His will.
    - The Holy Spirit illumines the mind to receive and understand Scripture.
    - Christ is the ultimate self-revelation of God, making Him truly knowable.
    - "God bestows the actual knowledge of himself upon us only in the Scriptures." (Institutes I.6.1)

3. **The Sensus Divinitatis**
    - Every human being is endowed with a natural sense of the divine.
    - This sense is universal and inescapable, though often corrupted by idolatry.
    - The **sensus divinitatis** is not sufficient for true worship or salvation.
    - It demonstrates that atheism is unnatural and self-deceptive.
    - "That there exists in the human mind, and indeed by natural instinct, some sense of Deity, we hold to be beyond dispute." (Institutes I.3.1)

4. **The Noetic Effects of Sin**
    - Human sinfulness distorts and suppresses the knowledge of God.
    - Fallen humanity exchanges true knowledge for idolatry and superstition.
    - Only regeneration and the Spirit’s work can restore right knowledge of God.
    - The **clarity of God’s revelation** is not at fault; the problem lies in human depravity.
    - "Ignorance of God is the origin of all evils." (Institutes I.1.1)

5. **The Self-Authenticating Nature of Scripture**
    - Scripture is **self-authenticating** and does not depend on human approval.
    - The testimony of the Holy Spirit confirms the divine origin of Scripture in the believer’s heart.
    - The authority of Scripture is ultimate for knowing God truly.
    - Faith is grounded in the inward work of the Spirit, not external proofs.
    - "Scripture exhibits fully as clear evidence of its own truth as white and black things do of their color, or sweet and bitter things do of their taste." (Institutes I.7.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of the **existence and knowability of God** profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition, especially through his articulation of the **sensus divinitatis** and the necessity of **special revelation**. His emphasis on the **self-authenticating authority of Scripture** and the noetic effects of sin remains foundational for Reformed epistemology. Calvin’s insights continue to influence contemporary discussions on natural theology, revelation, and the relationship between faith and reason.
