# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen defended the **objective reality** and **knowability of God** against both liberal theology and agnosticism, insisting that **revelation** is necessary for true knowledge of God. He maintained that God’s existence is not a product of human experience but is grounded in **historical revelation** and **Scripture**. Machen argued that the Christian faith is rooted in facts about God that are both knowable and revealed.

- "Without the objective revelation, religion sinks back into the subjectivism of the individual soul and loses contact with the living God." ("Christianity and Liberalism")

## Key Works

- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- The Christian Faith in the Modern World (1936)
- What Is Faith? (1925)
- The Origin of Paul's Religion (1921)
- God Transcendent: And Other Sermons (1949, posthumous)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Objective and Independent**
    - God exists apart from human thought or religious feeling.
    - Divine reality is not constructed by the church or individual experience.
    - The being of God is the necessary foundation for all theology.
    - Machen rejects all forms of religious subjectivism.
    - "The Christian man believes that an objective revelation is the only possible basis of religion." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **God is Knowable through Revelation**
    - Human beings cannot know God by reason alone.
    - Knowledge of God depends on God’s self-disclosure in history.
    - **Scripture** is the primary means by which God makes Himself known.
    - Revelation is both propositional and historical.
    - "We know God only because He has revealed Himself." (The Christian Faith in the Modern World)

3. **Revelation is Historical and Propositional**
    - God’s revelation is given in real historical events.
    - The content of revelation includes factual, propositional truth.
    - The Bible records God’s acts and interprets their meaning.
    - Faith is grounded in these historical realities, not mere ideas.
    - "The Bible contains an account of things that actually happened." (Christianity and Liberalism)

4. **Faith is Knowledge-based and Rational**
    - Faith involves assent to the truth of God’s revelation.
    - Christian belief is not irrational or a leap in the dark.
    - Faith is inseparable from knowledge of God’s acts and words.
    - Machen opposes fideism and anti-intellectualism.
    - "Faith is essentially assent to a proposition." (What Is Faith?)

5. **Rejection of Liberalism’s View of God**
    - Liberal theology reduces God to a symbol of moral ideals.
    - Machen insists on the personal, transcendent God of the Bible.
    - The God of Christianity is not discovered by human intuition.
    - True knowledge of God is impossible apart from supernatural revelation.
    - "Liberalism regards God as the Father of all men; Christianity regards Him as the Father only of those who are in Christ Jesus." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s defense of the **objective knowability of God** shaped 20th-century Reformed apologetics and confessional orthodoxy. His insistence on the necessity of **revelation** and the historical grounding of faith provided a bulwark against both liberalism and neo-orthodoxy. Machen’s work continues to influence evangelical and Reformed understandings of the relationship between **revelation, faith, and knowledge**. His legacy endures in institutions like Westminster Theological Seminary and in ongoing debates about the nature of Christian doctrine.
