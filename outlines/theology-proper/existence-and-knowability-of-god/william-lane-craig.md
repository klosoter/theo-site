# William Lane Craig (1949–)

William Lane Craig is a leading contemporary philosopher and apologist who defends the **existence** and **knowability of God** through rigorous philosophical argumentation and engagement with both classical and modern objections. He is especially known for his articulation of the **Kalam Cosmological Argument**, as well as his work on **natural theology**, **divine attributes**, and the **epistemology of religious belief**.

- "If God does not exist, then objective moral values and duties do not exist." (Reasonable Faith)

## Key Works

- Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics
- The Kalam Cosmological Argument
- Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview (with J.P. Moreland)
- On Guard: Defending Your Faith with Reason and Precision
- The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology (editor and contributor)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Demonstrable by Reason**
    - Argues for the rationality of belief in God through **cosmological**, **teleological**, and **moral arguments**.
    - Emphasizes the **Kalam Cosmological Argument** as a key proof for a transcendent Creator.
    - Maintains that philosophical reasoning can lead to knowledge of God’s existence.
    - Engages with both classical and contemporary atheistic critiques.
    "The universe began to exist, therefore the universe has a cause." (The Kalam Cosmological Argument)

2. **God is Knowable through Natural Theology**
    - Asserts that humans can have **knowledge of God** apart from special revelation.
    - Defends the use of **natural theology** as a legitimate means to know God.
    - Holds that arguments from nature and reason reveal key **divine attributes**.
    - Sees natural theology as complementary to, not in competition with, **revelation**.
    "Natural theology is the attempt to provide a rational justification for belief in God’s existence." (Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview)

3. **Religious Experience as Properly Basic**
    - Affirms that **belief in God** can be **properly basic** and rational apart from evidence or argument.
    - Draws on **Reformed epistemology** (especially Alvin Plantinga) to defend immediate knowledge of God.
    - Argues that the **witness of the Holy Spirit** provides direct epistemic warrant.
    - Maintains that such experience is not easily defeasible by counter-arguments.
    "Belief in God is for the one who attends to it properly basic." (Reasonable Faith)

4. **Divine Attributes are Philosophically Coherent**
    - Defends the **coherence** of classical divine attributes: **omnipotence**, **omniscience**, **aseity**, etc.
    - Responds to philosophical challenges regarding the compatibility of these attributes.
    - Argues that God’s nature is consistent with both **Scripture** and **reason**.
    - Engages in analytic theology to clarify and defend these attributes.
    "God is the greatest conceivable being, and as such must possess all great-making properties." (Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview)

5. **Objective Morality Depends on God’s Existence**
    - Argues that **objective moral values and duties** require a transcendent foundation.
    - Claims that atheism cannot provide a sufficient basis for moral objectivity.
    - Uses the **moral argument** as evidence for God’s existence and knowability.
    - Connects the existence of God to the grounding of **moral knowledge**.
    "If God does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist." (Reasonable Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Craig has been a central figure in the revival of **Christian philosophy** and **apologetics** in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, especially regarding arguments for the existence and knowability of God. His defense of the **Kalam Cosmological Argument** has sparked renewed philosophical and scientific discussion about the origins of the universe. Through debates, publications, and public engagement, Craig has shaped contemporary discourse on **natural theology** and the rationality of theistic belief. His work continues to influence evangelical scholarship and the broader field of analytic philosophy of religion.
