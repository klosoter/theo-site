# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck maintained that the **existence and knowability of God** are foundational to Christian theology, emphasizing both the **objective reality of God** and the **possibility of true, though analogical, knowledge** of Him. He argued that while God is **incomprehensible** in His essence, He has genuinely revealed Himself through **general and special revelation**, making knowledge of Him accessible yet always dependent on divine initiative.

- "God can be known, for he has revealed himself, but he cannot be comprehended, because in his revelation he remains the eternal and infinite One." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.33)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- Philosophy of Revelation
- The Doctrine of God (abridged version of Reformed Dogmatics material)
- Our Reasonable Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Existence is Self-Evident and Revealed**
    - God’s existence is not deduced from human reasoning but is presupposed in all thought and reality.
    - **General revelation** in creation and conscience testifies universally to God’s existence.
    - The **sensus divinitatis** ensures that all people have an innate awareness of God.
    - Denial of God’s existence is a result of sin, not lack of evidence.
    - "Scripture nowhere seeks to prove the existence of God; it assumes it and declares it." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.29)

2. **God is Incomprehensible Yet Knowable**
    - God’s **incomprehensibility** means His essence cannot be fully grasped by finite minds.
    - True knowledge of God is possible because He has accommodated Himself to human understanding.
    - All knowledge of God is **analogical**, not univocal or equivocal.
    - The distinction between the **archetypal** (God’s own knowledge) and **ectypal** (creaturely knowledge) is crucial.
    - "We know God in so far as he reveals himself, but we do not know him as he is in himself." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.33)

3. **Revelation as the Basis of Knowledge of God**
    - **Special revelation** (Scripture) is necessary for saving knowledge of God.
    - **General revelation** is sufficient to render humanity without excuse but insufficient for salvation.
    - Revelation is both propositional (words) and personal (God’s self-disclosure).
    - The unity of revelation in creation, history, and Scripture is emphasized.
    - "Revelation is the presupposition, the foundation, and the content of all theology." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1.279)

4. **Faith and Reason in Knowing God**
    - Faith is the proper response to God’s revelation and is itself a gift of grace.
    - Reason is not autonomous but functions rightly only when illumined by revelation.
    - There is no conflict between faith and reason when both are rightly ordered.
    - Apologetics must begin with the presupposition of God’s self-revelation.
    - "Faith is not opposed to reason but goes beyond it, resting on the authority of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1.493)

5. **The Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God is **absolute** and qualitatively distinct from creation.
    - Human knowledge of God is always creaturely and dependent.
    - The **analogy of being** (analogia entis) is rejected in favor of the **analogy of faith** (analogia fidei).
    - Divine accommodation ensures that revelation is suited to human capacity without compromising God’s transcendence.
    - "All our knowledge of God is derived from his revelation and is therefore analogical." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.36)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of the **existence and knowability of God** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in its engagement with modern philosophy and epistemology. His careful balance of **incomprehensibility** and **revelation** continues to influence contemporary discussions on the doctrine of God. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold both the mystery and accessibility of the divine in a confessional Reformed framework.
