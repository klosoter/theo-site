# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **existence and knowability of God** through the lens of **existentialist philosophy** and **demythologization**. He argued that God cannot be known through **natural theology** or objective proofs, but only through **revelation** encountered in the **kerygma** of the New Testament, which calls the individual to authentic existence.

- "God is never a given quantity in the world, but is always the unknown God, the mystery, the beyond of all that can be experienced." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann (1960)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Natural Theology**
    - Denies that God's existence can be proven or inferred from the natural world.
    - Critiques traditional arguments for God as products of a pre-scientific worldview.
    - Insists that God is not an object among objects within the world.
    - Emphasizes the radical transcendence and hiddenness of God.
    - "God is not a thing or being within the world, but the ground of all being." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Primacy of Revelation in the Kerygma**
    - God is known only through the proclamation of the gospel.
    - The **kerygma** confronts the hearer with a call to decision and faith.
    - Revelation is not propositional but existential and personal.
    - The event of faith is where God becomes known, not through rational deduction.
    - "Faith is the openness to the word of God as it encounters us in the kerygma." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Biblical language about God is mythological and must be interpreted existentially.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential truth behind the myths.
    - The myths point to the human encounter with the transcendent.
    - The knowability of God is mediated through existential interpretation, not literal cosmology.
    - "What matters is not the mythological world picture, but the existential meaning it expresses." (New Testament and Mythology)

4. **Existential Encounter with God**
    - Knowledge of God is an existential event, not an intellectual achievement.
    - God is encountered in the individual's response to the call of faith.
    - Authentic existence arises from openness to God's address.
    - The question of God's existence is inseparable from the question of human existence.
    - "God is not an object of theoretical knowledge, but is encountered in existential self-understanding." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Critique of Objectivism in Theology**
    - Rejects the idea that God can be objectively described or defined.
    - Theological statements are confessions of faith, not scientific propositions.
    - The knowability of God is always mediated by human existence and language.
    - Theology must avoid reducing God to a concept or object of study.
    - "The reality of God is not a matter of theoretical knowledge but of existential decision." (Existence and Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's approach to the **existence and knowability of God** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the realms of **existentialist interpretation** and the critique of **natural theology**. His emphasis on **demythologization** and the existential encounter with God influenced both liberal and neo-orthodox theologians, sparking ongoing debates about the nature of revelation and faith. While controversial, his work remains a touchstone for discussions about the limits of human knowledge of God and the centrality of faith in theological epistemology.
