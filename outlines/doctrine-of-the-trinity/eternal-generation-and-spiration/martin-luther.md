# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the traditional doctrine of the **Trinity**, including the **eternal generation of the Son** and the **eternal spiration of the Spirit**, as articulated in the ecumenical creeds. While not a locus of frequent controversy in his writings, Luther upheld the **distinctions of the divine persons** as rooted in their eternal relations of origin, emphasizing the **Son’s begottenness** and the **Spirit’s procession** from the Father and the Son. He maintained these doctrines as essential to orthodox **Christology** and the church’s confession of God.

- "The Father begets, the Son is begotten, the Holy Spirit proceeds; yet there are not three gods but one God." (Large Catechism)

## Key Works

- The Large Catechism
- The Small Catechism
- Lectures on Genesis
- Commentary on Galatians
- The Schmalkald Articles

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Nicene Doctrine**
    - Luther upheld the **Nicene Creed**’s teaching on the eternal generation of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.
    - He insisted that these relations distinguish the persons without dividing the **divine essence**.
    - Luther viewed the creedal language as a faithful summary of **biblical revelation**.
    - He rejected any subordinationism, affirming the full **deity** of each person.
    - "We believe in one God in three persons, as the Creed teaches." (Large Catechism)

2. **Scriptural Foundation for Eternal Generation**
    - Luther grounded the doctrine of the Son’s eternal generation in key biblical texts (e.g., John 1:1–18).
    - He interpreted “begotten, not made” as signifying the Son’s unique, eternal relationship to the Father.
    - The distinction of persons is not a matter of temporal sequence but of **eternal relation**.
    - He saw the Father’s begetting of the Son as the archetype of all divine self-revelation.
    - "The Son is not made, but eternally begotten of the Father." (Large Catechism)

3. **Procession of the Spirit from Father and Son**
    - Luther affirmed the **Filioque**, teaching that the Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son.
    - He saw this as essential for maintaining the unity and equality of the persons.
    - The Spirit’s procession is eternal, not a created event.
    - Luther linked the Spirit’s procession to the Spirit’s role in **sanctification** and revelation.
    - "The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and with them is worshiped and glorified." (Large Catechism)

4. **Rejection of Speculation Beyond Scripture**
    - Luther warned against philosophical speculation about the inner life of God.
    - He insisted that the church should not go beyond what is revealed in **Scripture** and confessed in the creeds.
    - The mystery of the Trinity is to be adored, not dissected.
    - He prioritized the **gospel** and the saving work of the Trinity over metaphysical curiosity.
    - "Where God closes his holy mouth, I will not open mine." (Lectures on Genesis)

5. **Trinitarian Relations and Salvation**
    - Luther connected the eternal relations of origin to the economy of salvation.
    - The Father sends the Son, who is eternally begotten, for redemption.
    - The Spirit, who proceeds from both, brings faith and sanctification.
    - The doctrine of the Trinity undergirds the **justification** and assurance of believers.
    - "All that we have and are comes from the Father through the Son by the Holy Spirit." (Large Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s unwavering commitment to the **Trinitarian distinctions** of eternal generation and spiration preserved the catholic faith within the Reformation. His catechetical writings ensured that these doctrines remained central in Lutheran confessions and worship. While he did not innovate in this area, his clear affirmation of the creedal tradition shaped Protestant orthodoxy and safeguarded the church’s confession of the **one God in three persons**.
