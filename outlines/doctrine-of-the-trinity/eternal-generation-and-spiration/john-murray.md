# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray was a prominent 20th-century **Reformed theologian** who upheld the classical doctrine of the **Trinity**, emphasizing both the unity of the divine essence and the real distinctions of the three persons. He affirmed the **eternal generation of the Son** and the **eternal spiration of the Spirit**, carefully avoiding any form of subordinationism or modalism.

- "The Son is eternally generated by the Father, and the Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father and the Son; these are distinctions within the unity of the Godhead." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Classical Trinitarian Distinctions**
    - Maintains the **personal properties** of Father, Son, and Spirit as essential to orthodox Trinitarianism.
    - Affirms **eternal generation** as the distinguishing property of the Son.
    - Teaches **eternal spiration** as the distinguishing property of the Spirit.
    - Rejects any form of modalism or subordinationism.
    "The distinctions of persons are not distinctions of essence but of personal properties." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Unity and Simplicity of God**
    - Stresses that the **divine essence** is numerically one and indivisible.
    - Asserts that personal distinctions do not divide the essence.
    - Emphasizes that all divine actions are undivided, though appropriated to persons.
    - Upholds the **simplicity** of God as foundational to Trinitarian doctrine.
    "There is but one divine essence, and the distinctions are not of essence but of person." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - Defines **eternal generation** as the personal property of the Son.
    - Insists that this generation is eternal, not temporal or created.
    - Sees this as the ground of the Son’s **eternal Sonship**.
    - Maintains that this doctrine safeguards the full deity of Christ.
    "The Son is eternally begotten of the Father, not made, not created, but eternally generated." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Eternal Spiration of the Spirit**
    - Teaches that the Spirit’s procession is eternal and from both Father and Son (**Filioque**).
    - Distinguishes spiration from generation as unique to the Spirit.
    - Affirms that this procession does not imply inferiority or temporality.
    - Grounds the Spirit’s personhood in this eternal relation.
    "The Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son, and this is his distinguishing property." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Biblical and Confessional Fidelity**
    - Grounds his Trinitarian theology in **Scripture** and the **Reformed confessions**.
    - Engages critically with historical and contemporary challenges to the doctrine.
    - Seeks to articulate the doctrine in continuity with the **Westminster Standards**.
    - Emphasizes the practical and doxological implications of Trinitarian doctrine.
    "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a speculative construction but the deposit of divine revelation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of **eternal generation** and **spiration** has reinforced the classical Reformed understanding of the Trinity for generations of students and pastors. His commitment to **biblical fidelity** and confessional orthodoxy has made his writings a standard reference in systematic theology. By upholding the unity and distinction within the Godhead, Murray has contributed to the ongoing vitality of Reformed Trinitarianism in the modern era.
