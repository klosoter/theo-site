# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann reinterprets the doctrines of **eternal generation** and **spiration** within a **social Trinitarian** framework, emphasizing the dynamic, relational life of the **Triune God**. He critiques classical metaphysical formulations, arguing for a more participatory and mutual understanding of the **Father, Son, and Spirit** that resists hierarchical subordination and underscores the perichoretic unity of the divine persons.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is the Christian doctrine of God. It is not a speculative, but a practical doctrine, and is intended to describe the God who is experienced in salvation history." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Key Works

- History and the Triune God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Relational Ontology of the Trinity**
    - The **Father, Son, and Spirit** exist in mutual, reciprocal relationships rather than hierarchical order.
    - Eternal generation and spiration are seen as expressions of divine communion, not subordination.
    - The divine persons are constituted by their relationships, not by isolated substance.
    - The Trinity is a model for community and mutuality in the church and world.
    - "The persons of the Trinity exist so deeply in one another that they are one."

2. **Critique of Classical Subordinationism**
    - Rejects any notion that **eternal generation** and **spiration** imply ontological subordination.
    - Argues that traditional formulations risk undermining the equality of the divine persons.
    - Sees the monarchy of the Father as a relational, not causal, priority.
    - Emphasizes the co-equality and co-eternity of all three persons.
    - "The Father is not the origin in the sense of a cause, but in the sense of a relationship."

3. **Perichoresis as the Key to Divine Unity**
    - Eternal generation and spiration are interpreted through the lens of **perichoresis** (mutual indwelling).
    - The unity of God is dynamic and relational, not static or monarchical.
    - Each person fully participates in the life of the others.
    - This mutual indwelling resists any form of modalism or tritheism.
    - "The unity of the triune God is to be found in the perichoresis of the divine persons."

4. **Historical and Eschatological Orientation**
    - The Trinity is revealed in the history of salvation, especially in the cross and resurrection.
    - Eternal generation and spiration are not abstract metaphysical processes but are disclosed in God’s actions.
    - The Spirit’s procession is linked to the eschatological fulfillment of creation.
    - The Trinitarian life is open to the world and history, not closed within itself.
    - "The trinitarian history of God is open to the history of the world."

5. **Pneumatological Emphasis**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is not merely the bond between Father and Son but a distinct, active person.
    - Spiration is understood as the Spirit’s dynamic role in creation and redemption.
    - The Spirit proceeds from the Father (and through the Son) in a way that avoids Western filioque controversies.
    - The Spirit’s procession is essential for the openness and freedom of the divine life.
    - "The Spirit is the power of the future, the openness of the triune God to the world."

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s **social Trinitarianism** has significantly influenced contemporary theology, challenging traditional Western accounts of **eternal generation** and **spiration** by emphasizing relationality and mutuality. His approach has encouraged renewed interest in the doctrine of the Trinity as central to Christian faith and practice, especially in ecumenical and liberationist contexts. Moltmann’s work continues to provoke debate about the implications of Trinitarian doctrine for ecclesiology, ethics, and the doctrine of God.
