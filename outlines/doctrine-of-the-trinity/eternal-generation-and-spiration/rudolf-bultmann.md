# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the doctrines of **eternal generation** and **spiration** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He questioned the metaphysical categories traditionally used in **Trinitarian theology**, focusing instead on the existential significance of the **Christ event** and the **proclamation (kerygma)** for faith. For Bultmann, classical formulations of intra-Trinitarian relations were less important than the encounter with God in the preached word.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Trinitarian Language**
    - Traditional language of **eternal generation** and **spiration** is seen as mythological, rooted in outdated cosmologies.
    - The focus should be on the existential meaning of the **Son** and **Spirit** for the believer today.
    - Bultmann seeks to reinterpret dogmatic formulas in terms of personal encounter rather than metaphysical processions.
    - The language of "Father," "Son," and "Spirit" is symbolic, not ontological.
    - "Mythological statements are not literal descriptions but expressions of human self-understanding." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The **kerygma** (proclamation) is the locus of divine revelation, not metaphysical relations within the Godhead.
    - The significance of Christ and the Spirit is found in their impact on the hearer, not in eternal processions.
    - The proclamation confronts individuals with the call to authentic existence.
    - The doctrine of the Trinity is meaningful only insofar as it relates to the event of faith.
    - "It is the word of preaching in which the Christ who was crucified and is risen encounters us." (Kerygma and Myth)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Christology and Pneumatology**
    - **Sonship** and **Spirit** are interpreted as existential realities, not eternal ontological distinctions.
    - The believer encounters God as Father through the Son in the power of the Spirit, within the event of faith.
    - The focus is on the transformation of existence, not on metaphysical speculation.
    - The eternal generation and spiration are reinterpreted as symbols of the believer's relationship to God.
    - "Faith grasps the Christ event as the decisive event for existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Rejection of Metaphysical Speculation**
    - Bultmann rejects the metaphysical framework of **Nicene** and **Augustinian** Trinitarianism as inaccessible to modern thought.
    - The concern is not with how the Son and Spirit proceed from the Father, but with the existential meaning of their presence.
    - Theological language must be translated into categories meaningful for contemporary existence.
    - The mystery of God is encountered in existential decision, not in speculative doctrine.
    - "We can speak of God only in terms of what he does for us." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Scripture as Witness, Not Metaphysical Blueprint**
    - The New Testament's Trinitarian language is a witness to faith, not a metaphysical system.
    - The biblical witness must be interpreted in light of the existential situation of the modern person.
    - Eternal generation and spiration are not explicit biblical doctrines but later theological constructions.
    - The authority of Scripture lies in its power to confront and transform, not in its metaphysical precision.
    - "The New Testament does not present a doctrine of the Trinity but a witness to the event of revelation." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **eternal generation** and **spiration** profoundly shaped modern theology by shifting the focus from metaphysical speculation to existential interpretation. His method of **demythologization** challenged traditional Trinitarian formulations and influenced generations of scholars to reconsider the meaning and function of dogmatic language. While often criticized for undermining classical doctrine, Bultmann’s emphasis on the **kerygma** and the existential encounter with God remains a significant force in contemporary theological discourse.
