# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a classical doctrine of the **Trinity**, affirming the **eternal generation of the Son** and the **eternal spiration of the Holy Spirit** as essential to the personal distinctions within the Godhead. These concepts are rooted in the **ontological Trinity**, maintaining that the Son is eternally begotten of the Father, and the Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father and the Son, without subordination or division of essence.

- "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost: the Father is of none, neither begotten, nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son." (Westminster Confession of Faith II.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646), especially Chapter II: "Of God, and of the Holy Trinity"
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 6–11
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 4–6
- The Westminster Assembly’s Minutes and Papers (ed. Chad Van Dixhoorn)
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - The Son is **eternally begotten** of the Father, not made or created.
    - This generation is an **immanent, necessary, and incomprehensible act** within the Godhead.
    - It establishes the **personal distinction** between the Father and the Son.
    - The Son shares the same **divine essence** as the Father, without subordination.
    - "The Son is eternally begotten of the Father." (WCF II.3)

2. **Eternal Spiration of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit **eternally proceeds** from the Father and the Son (**Filioque**).
    - This procession is not temporal or created, but an **eternal relation of origin**.
    - The Spirit’s procession distinguishes Him personally from the Father and the Son.
    - The Spirit is fully and equally **God**, sharing the same essence.
    - "The Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son." (WCF II.3)

3. **Unity of Essence, Distinction of Persons**
    - The three persons are **of one substance, power, and eternity**.
    - Personal properties (generation, spiration) do not divide the divine essence.
    - There is no **priority, inferiority, or separation** among the persons.
    - The distinctions are solely by **relations of origin**.
    - "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity." (WCF II.3)

4. **Rejection of Subordinationism and Modalism**
    - The Son and Spirit are **not subordinate** in essence or deity to the Father.
    - The distinctions are not mere **modes or manifestations**.
    - Each person is fully and truly **God**.
    - The doctrine guards against both **Arianism** and **Sabellianism**.
    - "These three are one God, the same in substance, equal in power and glory." (WSC Q6)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Relations**
    - The Standards ground **eternal generation and spiration** in biblical revelation (e.g., John 1:14, 15:26).
    - The language of **begetting** and **proceeding** is drawn from Scripture, interpreted analogically.
    - The doctrine is confessed as a **mystery** revealed, not a philosophical speculation.
    - The Standards affirm the sufficiency of Scripture for articulating these truths.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable dependence on Him." (WLC Q5, paraphrased)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped Reformed and Presbyterian theology, providing a definitive articulation of **Trinitarian doctrine** for subsequent confessional traditions. Their precise formulations of **eternal generation** and **spiration** have served as a benchmark for orthodoxy, influencing catechesis, worship, and theological discourse. By upholding the classical distinctions within the Godhead, the Standards continue to inform contemporary debates on the doctrine of the Trinity and safeguard the church’s confession of the one true God.
