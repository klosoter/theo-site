# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas offers a systematic account of **eternal generation** and **spiration** within his doctrine of the **Trinity**, emphasizing the distinction of **persons** by their relations of origin. For Aquinas, the **Son** is eternally generated by the **Father**, while the **Holy Spirit** proceeds by spiration from both the Father and the Son, maintaining the unity of the **divine essence** while distinguishing the persons by their relational properties.

- "The Son is said to be begotten by the Father, and the Holy Ghost to proceed from the Father and the Son, according to the order of nature in the divine Persons." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, I, Questions 27–43 (Treatise on the Trinity)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 24–26
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book I, Distinctions 10–19
- De Potentia, Questions 9–10
- The Trinity (De Trinitate), especially Book VI

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation Distinguishes the Son**
    - The **Son** is eternally generated by the **Father** alone, not by the will but by the divine nature.
    - This generation is an **immanent** act, not temporal, and establishes the Son’s distinct personhood.
    - The relation of **paternity** and **filiation** are real distinctions within the Godhead.
    - The Son’s generation is the only mode of origin proper to Him, distinguishing Him from the Spirit.
    - "The Son is not from the Father by way of spiration, but by way of generation." (Summa Theologiae I, q.27, a.2)

2. **Spiration as the Mode of the Spirit’s Procession**
    - The **Holy Spirit** proceeds by spiration, not generation, from the **Father and the Son**.
    - Spiration is a distinct mode of origin, corresponding to the procession of love.
    - The Spirit’s procession is not a second generation, preserving the uniqueness of the Son’s filiation.
    - The Spirit’s origin from both Father and Son upholds the **Filioque**.
    - "The Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as from one principle." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.4)

3. **Relations of Origin as Person-Distinguishing**
    - The divine persons are distinguished solely by their **relations of origin**.
    - These relations do not divide the **divine essence** but constitute real distinctions.
    - **Paternity**, **filiation**, and **spiration/procession** are the only relations in God.
    - The persons are subsistent relations, not accidents or properties.
    - "In God, relations alone multiply the persons." (Summa Theologiae I, q.28, a.3)

4. **Unity of Essence Amid Distinction of Persons**
    - All three persons share the same **divine essence** fully and equally.
    - The processions do not introduce composition or division in God.
    - The acts of generation and spiration are internal and necessary, not contingent.
    - The unity of the principle in spiration affirms the Spirit’s procession from both Father and Son as one source.
    - "The divine essence is not divided by the distinction of persons." (Summa Theologiae I, q.39, a.1)

5. **Filioque and the Western Tradition**
    - Aquinas defends the **Filioque**, asserting the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.
    - He argues this does not compromise the monarchy of the Father as the principle without principle.
    - The Son’s involvement in spiration is as a co-principle with the Father, not as a separate source.
    - This position aligns with the Latin tradition and seeks to address Eastern objections.
    - "The Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father immediately, and from the Son mediately." (Summa Contra Gentiles IV, ch.24)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s articulation of **eternal generation** and **spiration** became foundational for Western Trinitarian theology, shaping both Roman Catholic and later Protestant formulations. His careful distinction of **relations of origin** and defense of the **Filioque** influenced scholastic debates and ecumenical dialogues. Aquinas’s synthesis of patristic sources with Aristotelian philosophy provided a durable framework for understanding the unity and distinction within the Godhead, and his work remains a touchstone for systematic theology on the doctrine of the Trinity.
