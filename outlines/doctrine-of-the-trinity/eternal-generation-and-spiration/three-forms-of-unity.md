# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity affirm the classical doctrine of the **Trinity**, explicitly upholding the **eternal generation of the Son** and the **eternal spiration of the Holy Spirit**. These confessional standards articulate the distinct **personal properties** of the divine persons while maintaining the unity and simplicity of the **divine essence**. Their formulations reflect a commitment to the historic **Nicene** and **Athanasius Creeds** and serve as a doctrinal anchor for Reformed churches.

- "God is one in essence, yet distinguished in three persons, distinguished by incommunicable properties." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Articles 8–11
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Day 8
- Canons of Dort, Rejection of Errors (I.1)
- The Ecumenical Creeds (Apostles’, Nicene, Athanasian) as appended to the Forms
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - The Son is eternally begotten of the Father, not made or created.
    - This generation is an internal, necessary act within the **divine essence**.
    - The Son shares the same **substance** as the Father, differing only in personal property.
    - The doctrine safeguards the full **deity of Christ** and the distinction of persons.
    - "The Father is the cause, origin, and beginning of all things visible and invisible; the Son is the Word, the wisdom, and the image of the Father; the Holy Spirit is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father and the Son." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

2. **Eternal Spiration of the Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from both the Father and the Son (**Filioque**).
    - This procession is not a temporal act but an eternal, internal relation.
    - The Spirit is fully God, sharing the same **divine essence** as Father and Son.
    - The spiration distinguishes the Spirit’s personhood without dividing the Godhead.
    - "The Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son—neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but only proceeding." (Belgic Confession, Art. 11)

3. **Unity and Simplicity of the Divine Essence**
    - There is only one simple, undivided **divine essence**.
    - The three persons are not three parts, but each is fully God.
    - The distinctions of persons do not compromise divine unity.
    - The doctrine opposes both **tritheism** and **modalism**.
    - "We believe in one only God, who is one single essence, in which are three persons." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

4. **Distinction of Persons by Incommunicable Properties**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit are distinguished by their unique **personal properties**.
    - Eternal generation and spiration are the basis for these distinctions.
    - These properties are incommunicable and do not overlap among the persons.
    - The distinctions are necessary for orthodox **Trinitarianism**.
    - "These persons thus distinguished are not divided, nor intermixed; for the Father has not assumed the flesh, nor has the Holy Spirit, but only the Son." (Belgic Confession, Art. 10)

5. **Confessional and Scriptural Foundation**
    - The Three Forms ground their Trinitarian doctrine in **Scripture** and the **ecumenical creeds**.
    - They explicitly cite biblical texts (e.g., Matthew 28:19; John 14–16).
    - The confessions reject all heresies that deny eternal generation or spiration.
    - The doctrine is presented as essential to the Christian faith and worship.
    - "This doctrine of the holy Trinity has always been maintained and preserved in the true Church since the time of the apostles to this very day." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have provided a confessional backbone for **Reformed Trinitarian orthodoxy**, shaping the doctrine of God in continental Reformed churches. Their clear articulation of **eternal generation** and **spiration** has influenced subsequent Reformed theology and catechesis. By rooting their formulations in both Scripture and the historic creeds, they have ensured continuity with the broader Christian tradition and offered a robust defense against anti-Trinitarian errors.
