# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin provided a rigorous Reformed articulation of the **doctrines of eternal generation and spiration** within the **Trinitarian economy**. He defended the **personal properties** of the Son and the Spirit, grounding their distinction in the **eternal relations of origin** while maintaining the unity of the **divine essence**. Turretin’s scholastic method clarified the orthodox position against both **Socinian** and **Unitarian** objections.

- "The generation of the Son and the spiration of the Holy Spirit are not works ad extra, but immanent acts in God, constituting the personal properties." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), especially Book III, Questions 27–30
- The Doctrine of the Trinity (sections within Institutes)
- Selected Theological Questions (Quaestiones Theologicae Selectae)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation as Personal Property of the Son**
    - The Son is distinguished from the Father by **eternal generation**, not by essence or will.
    - This generation is **necessary**, not voluntary or temporal.
    - It is an **immanent act** within the Godhead, not a work ad extra.
    - The Son receives the whole divine essence from the Father, yet remains consubstantial.
    - "The Son is said to be begotten, not made, because he receives the divine essence itself, not something created." (Institutes)

2. **Spiration as Personal Property of the Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son by **spiration**.
    - Spiration is distinct from generation, marking the Spirit’s unique personal property.
    - The Spirit’s procession is **eternal** and internal to the Godhead.
    - Turretin affirms the **Filioque**, defending Western Trinitarianism.
    - "The Spirit proceeds from both, not as from two principles, but from one principle of Father and Son." (Institutes)

3. **Unity of Essence, Distinction of Persons**
    - The divine essence is **numerically one** in all three persons.
    - Personal distinctions arise solely from **relations of origin**.
    - There is no subordination of essence, only of order and relation.
    - The persons are **co-equal** and **co-eternal**.
    - "The distinction of persons does not divide the essence, but only distinguishes by relations." (Institutes)

4. **Rejection of Temporal Generation and Spiration**
    - Both generation and spiration are **eternal**, not occurring in time.
    - Turretin opposes any notion of **created** or **temporal** procession.
    - He refutes Socinian and Arian denials of eternal relations.
    - The acts are **necessary** and intrinsic to the divine life.
    - "There never was a time when the Son was not begotten, nor the Spirit not proceeding." (Institutes)

5. **Scriptural and Patristic Foundations**
    - Turretin grounds his doctrine in **biblical texts** (e.g., John 1:14, 15:26).
    - He appeals to the **Nicene Creed** and patristic consensus.
    - The terms "generation" and "procession" are analogical, not univocal.
    - He uses **scholastic distinctions** to clarify and defend orthodox doctrine.
    - "The church has always confessed the eternal generation of the Son and the procession of the Spirit as the foundation of personal distinction." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s precise articulation of **eternal generation and spiration** became a standard in Reformed scholastic theology, shaping later confessional formulations. His defense of the **Filioque** and the **personal properties** of the divine persons provided a robust framework for subsequent Reformed and evangelical Trinitarianism. Turretin’s influence endures in systematic theology, particularly in discussions of the **Trinitarian relations of origin** and the unity of the divine essence.
