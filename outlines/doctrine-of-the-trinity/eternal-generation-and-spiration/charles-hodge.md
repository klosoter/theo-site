# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge upheld the classical doctrine of the **Trinity**, affirming the **eternal generation of the Son** and the **eternal spiration of the Spirit** as essential to distinguishing the divine persons without dividing the **divine essence**. He emphasized that these personal properties are necessary for maintaining both the unity and the distinctions within the **Godhead**, in line with historic **Reformed orthodoxy**.

- "The Son is said to be eternally begotten of the Father, and the Spirit to proceed from the Father and the Son." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially chapters on the Trinity)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons
- "The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity" (Princeton Review article)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans (for Trinitarian references)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation as Personal Property of the Son**
    - The Son is eternally begotten, not made, by the Father.
    - This generation is not an act in time but an eternal relationship within the Godhead.
    - It distinguishes the Son from the Father without implying subordination or division.
    - The doctrine safeguards the full **deity of Christ**.
    - "The eternal generation of the Son is the ground of the distinction between the first and second persons of the Trinity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Eternal Spiration of the Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son (**Filioque**).
    - Spiration is a personal property unique to the Spirit, not shared by the other persons.
    - This procession is necessary for distinguishing the Spirit within the **Trinitarian relations**.
    - Hodge affirms the Western tradition’s stance on the double procession.
    - "The Spirit is said to proceed from the Father and the Son, as the Son is said to be begotten of the Father." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Unity of Essence and Distinction of Persons**
    - The divine essence is numerically one, shared fully by all three persons.
    - Personal distinctions arise solely from relations of origin: generation and spiration.
    - There is no division, composition, or inequality within the Godhead.
    - The distinctions are real but do not compromise the unity of God.
    - "The three are the same in substance, equal in power and glory, but distinguished by their personal properties." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Rejection of Subordinationism**
    - Eternal generation and spiration do not imply inferiority or temporal priority.
    - The Son and Spirit are co-eternal and consubstantial with the Father.
    - Any subordination is only in terms of order, not essence or dignity.
    - Hodge opposes both Arianism and modalism in his Trinitarian theology.
    - "There is no subordination as to essence or dignity among the persons of the Trinity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Scriptural and Confessional Foundation**
    - Hodge grounds eternal generation and spiration in biblical revelation, especially John 1 and 15.
    - He appeals to the **Nicene Creed** and **Reformed confessions** for doctrinal clarity.
    - The doctrines are not speculative but necessary for a coherent doctrine of God.
    - He insists that these distinctions are revealed, not merely philosophical constructs.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity, as thus stated, is not a speculative doctrine, but a revealed fact." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **eternal generation and spiration** shaped generations of American Reformed theology, reinforcing the classical doctrine of the Trinity at Princeton Seminary and beyond. His careful distinction between **personal properties** and **divine essence** provided a robust framework for later systematicians. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary Reformed discussions, where his commitment to biblical and confessional fidelity remains a benchmark for orthodox Trinitarianism.
