# Stephen R. Holmes (1971– )

Stephen R. Holmes is a contemporary theologian who has critically engaged with **Cornelius Van Til’s** use of **one person language** in Trinitarian theology. Holmes argues that Van Til’s formulation departs from the **classical doctrine of the Trinity** by blurring the distinction between **person** and **essence**, and thus risks undermining the orthodox understanding of **divine persons**. Holmes insists on maintaining the traditional **pro-Nicene** distinctions to safeguard both unity and diversity within the Godhead.

- "Van Til’s language of the Trinity as ‘one person’ is not only novel, but also deeply problematic in terms of classical Trinitarian doctrine." (The Quest for the Trinity)

## Key Works

- The Quest for the Trinity: The Doctrine of God in Scripture, History and Modernity
- "Three Versus One? Some Problems in Recent Trinitarian Thought" (International Journal of Systematic Theology)
- "Trinitarian Doctrine: A Summary History" (in The Oxford Handbook of Systematic Theology)
- God of Grace and God of Glory: An Account of the Theology of Jonathan Edwards

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Classical Trinitarian Distinctions Must Be Maintained**
    - Emphasizes the necessity of distinguishing between **ousia** (essence) and **hypostasis** (person).
    - Argues that collapsing these categories leads to confusion about the nature of the Trinity.
    - Critiques Van Til’s language as a departure from **pro-Nicene** consensus.
    - Insists that the **one God** is not a person, but three persons in one essence.
    - "To speak of the Trinity as ‘one person’ is to risk modalism or to collapse the persons into a single subject." (The Quest for the Trinity)

2. **Personhood in Trinitarian Theology Is Irreducible**
    - Each divine person is fully God, yet irreducibly distinct from the others.
    - The language of “person” is not merely a label for modes or roles.
    - Van Til’s formulation threatens the real distinctions among the persons.
    - Orthodox Trinitarianism requires real, not merely notional, distinctions.
    - "The persons are not simply ways in which the one God appears, but are real and eternal distinctions within the divine life." (The Quest for the Trinity)

3. **Theological Language Must Be Governed by Historical Consensus**
    - Advocates for continuity with the **ecumenical creeds** and patristic formulations.
    - Warns against speculative or innovative terminology in core doctrines.
    - Sees Van Til’s “one person” language as lacking historical precedent.
    - Argues that doctrinal innovation can lead to confusion or heresy.
    - "The language of the creeds is carefully chosen to avoid precisely the confusion Van Til introduces." (The Quest for the Trinity)

4. **Unity and Diversity in God Must Be Held in Tension**
    - The unity of God is found in the **divine essence**, not in a singular personhood.
    - The diversity is safeguarded by the real distinctions of the three persons.
    - Overemphasis on unity at the expense of diversity distorts the doctrine.
    - Van Til’s approach risks erasing the richness of Trinitarian relations.
    - "The glory of the doctrine is that it holds together unity and diversity without confusion or division." (The Quest for the Trinity)

5. **Doctrinal Precision Protects Against Heresy**
    - Precision in Trinitarian language guards against **modalism** and **tritheism**.
    - Van Til’s language potentially opens the door to misunderstanding or error.
    - The church’s tradition provides boundaries for faithful theological reflection.
    - Theological innovation must be tested against the rule of faith.
    - "Where the tradition has spoken with care, we must tread carefully, lest we fall into ancient errors." (The Quest for the Trinity)

## Legacy and Impact

Holmes’s critique of Van Til’s **one person language** has become a significant reference point in contemporary Trinitarian debates, especially among those seeking to retrieve **classical theism**. His insistence on the **pro-Nicene** distinctions has reinforced the importance of doctrinal precision and historical continuity in systematic theology. Holmes’s work continues to shape discussions on the boundaries of orthodox Trinitarian confession, serving as a caution against speculative innovation in the doctrine of God.
