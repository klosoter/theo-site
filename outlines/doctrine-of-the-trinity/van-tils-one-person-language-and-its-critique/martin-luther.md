# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s approach to the doctrine of the **Trinity** and the **person of Christ** is rooted in the classical, conciliar tradition, emphasizing the unity of the **divine essence** and the distinction of **three persons**. Luther did not employ **one person language** in the sense Van Til did, but rather maintained the historic distinction between **persona** and **ousia**, insisting on the mystery of the **incarnation** and the communicatio idiomatum. His theology resists any conflation of the persons, focusing instead on the revealed character of God in Christ.

- "We must hold fast to the distinction of the persons, and yet the unity of the Godhead must not be destroyed." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- The Large Catechism (especially the sections on the Apostles’ Creed)
- The Small Catechism
- Lectures on Genesis
- Sermons on John’s Gospel
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 22: Sermons on the Gospel of St. John

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Classical Trinitarian Distinctions**
    - Maintains the distinction between **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** as three persons in one essence.
    - Rejects any reduction of the persons to mere modes or manifestations.
    - Emphasizes the eternal generation of the Son and procession of the Spirit.
    - Affirms the Nicene and Athanasian Creeds as faithful expositions of biblical truth.
    - "We must not confound the persons, nor divide the substance." (Large Catechism)

2. **Christological Clarity**
    - Upholds the **two natures** of Christ, divine and human, united in one person.
    - Insists on the real distinction and union without confusion or separation.
    - Emphasizes the importance of the **communicatio idiomatum** in understanding Christ’s work.
    - Rejects any formulation that would obscure the true humanity or divinity of Christ.
    - "He who does not believe in the true humanity and deity of Christ is not a Christian." (Sermons on John)

3. **Revelation in Christ**
    - Asserts that God is most fully known in the person of Jesus Christ.
    - The **incarnation** is the definitive self-revelation of the Triune God.
    - Stresses the necessity of faith in Christ for knowledge of God.
    - Rejects speculative approaches to the Trinity apart from Christ.
    - "Outside of Christ, God is not known as God wants to be known." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Mystery and Limits of Human Reason**
    - Affirms the **mystery** of the Trinity and the incarnation.
    - Warns against rationalistic attempts to explain or harmonize divine realities.
    - Encourages humble submission to the revealed Word.
    - Recognizes the limits of human language in expressing divine truths.
    - "Where reason fails, faith must hold fast to the Word." (Large Catechism)

5. **Scriptural Foundation**
    - Grounds all doctrinal formulations in the authority of **Scripture**.
    - Uses biblical language and categories to articulate the doctrine of God.
    - Critiques speculative theology not rooted in the biblical witness.
    - Insists that the **Trinity** is a revealed, not a constructed, doctrine.
    - "The Scriptures teach us to speak of God as He has revealed Himself." (Small Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of the **classical doctrine of the Trinity** and his careful Christological formulations have shaped Protestant orthodoxy and set boundaries for later theological developments. His resistance to speculative or innovative language about the divine persons, such as Van Til’s “one person” terminology, underscores his commitment to the historic creedal tradition. Luther’s insistence on the mystery and scriptural foundation of the Trinity continues to influence confessional theology and serves as a caution against collapsing the distinctions within the Godhead.
