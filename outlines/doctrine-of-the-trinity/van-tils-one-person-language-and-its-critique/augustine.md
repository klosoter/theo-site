# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **Trinity** emphasizes the unity of **essence** and the distinction of **persons** within the Godhead, insisting that God is one **substance** in three **persons** (personae). While Augustine does not use Van Til’s “one person” language, his careful articulation of **personhood** and **relation** in the Trinity provides a classical framework that critiques any blurring of the distinction between **unity** and **personhood** in Trinitarian theology.

- "For there is one God, because there is one divine nature or substance, but there are three persons because there are three relations." (De Trinitate, V.9.10)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Confessiones (Confessions)
- Enchiridion
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- Letters and Sermons (selected)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Essence in the Trinity**
    - God is one **substance** (essentia), not three substances.
    - The divine nature is wholly and indivisibly shared by Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - Unity is not merely a collective but a true ontological oneness.
    - Any language that suggests otherwise risks **tritheism**.
    - "The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are of one and the same substance or essence." (De Trinitate, I.7)

2. **Distinction of Persons by Relations**
    - The three **persons** are distinguished by their relations of origin: begetting, begotten, and proceeding.
    - These distinctions do not divide the divine essence.
    - Each person is fully God, yet not three gods.
    - The persons are not modes or parts, but real distinctions.
    - "They are not three gods, but one God, because they are not three substances but one substance." (De Trinitate, VII.4)

3. **Cautions Against Modalism and Tritheism**
    - Rejects any conflation of the persons into a single person (modalism).
    - Warns against dividing the Godhead into three separate beings (tritheism).
    - Emphasizes the necessity of both unity and distinction.
    - The language of “one person” for the Trinity is explicitly rejected.
    - "We do not say there are three persons in the sense that there are three separate beings." (De Trinitate, VII.11)

4. **Analogical Language for the Trinity**
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal.
    - Uses psychological analogies (memory, understanding, will) to illustrate unity and distinction.
    - Analogies serve to clarify, not to define the mystery.
    - The limitations of language must be acknowledged in Trinitarian discourse.
    - "When we speak of three persons, we do so not to express the reality, but to avoid silence." (De Trinitate, V.9.10)

5. **Personhood Rooted in Relation, Not Essence**
    - Personhood in God is defined by relation, not by individual substance.
    - Each person subsists in relation to the others.
    - The divine persons are not interchangeable or reducible to a single person.
    - The relational distinctions are eternal and constitutive of the Trinity.
    - "The Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit, but all are one God because of the unity of substance." (De Trinitate, I.4)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s robust articulation of **Trinitarian personhood** has profoundly shaped Western theology, providing a critical standard against which later formulations, such as Van Til’s “one person” language, are measured. His insistence on the unity of **essence** and the real distinction of **persons** remains foundational for orthodox Trinitarian doctrine. Augustine’s careful balance continues to inform contemporary discussions, ensuring that both the unity and diversity within the Godhead are preserved without confusion or division.
