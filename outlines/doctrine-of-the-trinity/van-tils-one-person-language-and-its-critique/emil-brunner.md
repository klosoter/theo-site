# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner critiqued **Cornelius Van Til’s** insistence on the **one person language** in Christology, arguing that it risks undermining the genuine **humanity** and **divine freedom** of Christ. Brunner maintained that the **Chalcedonian Definition** rightly preserves the distinction between **two natures** in the **one person** of Christ, but warned that Van Til’s approach could lead to a confusion of the natures and diminish the mystery inherent in the **Incarnation**.

- "The mystery of the Incarnation is not to be solved by logical consistency, but to be confessed in faith." (The Mediator)

## Key Works

- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Dogmatics, Vol. 2: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Chalcedonian Christology Maintained**
    - Emphasizes the importance of the **Chalcedonian Definition** in affirming both the full **divinity** and full **humanity** of Christ.
    - Warns against any formulation that blurs the distinction between the two natures.
    - Argues that Van Til’s “one person” language risks collapsing the distinction and thus threatens orthodox Christology.
    - Stresses that the mystery of the Incarnation must be preserved, not rationalized.
    - "The unity of the person does not mean the fusion of the natures." (The Mediator)

2. **Revelation as Personal Encounter**
    - Holds that **revelation** is fundamentally a personal event, not merely a doctrinal proposition.
    - Critiques Van Til’s tendency to systematize revelation in a way that may obscure the existential dimension.
    - Insists that the living Christ meets the believer in faith, beyond abstract formulations.
    - Sees the Incarnation as the supreme example of divine-human encounter.
    - "God reveals Himself, not a system of truth." (Revelation and Reason)

3. **Divine Freedom and Human Freedom**
    - Argues that Christ’s personhood must allow for genuine **divine freedom** and authentic **human freedom**.
    - Suggests that Van Til’s language may unintentionally subordinate Christ’s humanity to his divinity.
    - Maintains that the two natures must coexist without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - Emphasizes the paradox and tension inherent in the Incarnation.
    - "The freedom of God and the freedom of man meet in the person of Jesus Christ." (Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

4. **Faith and Mystery**
    - Stresses that the central doctrines of the faith, especially the Incarnation, are ultimately mysteries.
    - Critiques rationalistic tendencies that seek to resolve paradoxes through philosophical language.
    - Argues that Van Til’s approach may overstep the limits of theological language.
    - Calls for humility before the mystery of Christ’s person.
    - "Faith bows before the mystery, it does not dissect it." (The Mediator)

5. **Critique of Reformed Scholasticism**
    - Sees Van Til’s “one person” emphasis as a product of **Reformed scholasticism**.
    - Argues that this tradition sometimes prioritizes logical coherence over biblical paradox.
    - Advocates a return to the dynamic, existential realities of the biblical witness.
    - Warns against making the Incarnation a mere object of intellectual mastery.
    - "The living Christ cannot be captured by the categories of scholastic theology." (Truth as Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s critique of Van Til’s **one person language** contributed to ongoing debates about the proper articulation of **Christological mystery** within Reformed and broader Protestant theology. His emphasis on the existential and paradoxical nature of the **Incarnation** challenged overly systematic approaches and encouraged a more humble, faith-driven engagement with doctrinal formulations. Brunner’s work remains influential among those who seek to balance doctrinal fidelity with the recognition of divine mystery. His legacy endures in discussions about the limits of theological language and the centrality of personal encounter in Christian faith.
