# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, approached the doctrine of the **Trinity** with a strong emphasis on the **unity of the divine essence** and the classical formulation of **three persons in one God**. Warfield was critical of any language that might compromise the distinctiveness or co-equality of the **divine persons**, and he would have viewed Van Til’s “one person” language as a problematic departure from **orthodox Trinitarianism**.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is given to us in Scripture, not in the making, but made." (The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Person of Christ" (The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 2)
- "Calvin and Calvinism" (especially essays on the Trinity)
- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"
- Selected articles in The Princeton Theological Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Classical Trinitarian Formulation**
    - Upholds the **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** definitions of the Trinity.
    - Insists on the distinction between **one essence** and **three persons**.
    - Rejects any formulation that blurs the personal distinctions within the Godhead.
    - Views the historic creeds as faithful expositions of biblical teaching.
    - "The Scriptures teach us to recognize in the Godhead a Trinity of Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and to attribute to each the full divine substance." (The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity)

2. **Rejection of Modalism and Sabellianism**
    - Warns against language that suggests the persons are merely modes or manifestations.
    - Sees any collapse of personhood into a single subject as heretical.
    - Emphasizes the eternal relations of origin as essential to the doctrine.
    - Argues that the church’s confessions safeguard against modalistic tendencies.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is, in point of fact, the sum of the Christian revelation of God." (The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity)

3. **Personhood Defined by Relations**
    - Defines each divine person by their unique relations of origin: **Father** (unbegotten), **Son** (begotten), **Spirit** (proceeding).
    - Asserts that these relations are real and eternal, not merely economic or functional.
    - Maintains that personhood in God is not analogous to human personhood.
    - Stresses that the unity of essence does not erase personal distinctions.
    - "The distinctions in the Godhead are not distinctions of substance, but of relations." (The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity)

4. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Argues that the Trinity is a revealed doctrine, not a product of philosophical speculation.
    - Grounds the doctrine in the progressive revelation of both Old and New Testaments.
    - Insists that biblical language must govern theological formulation.
    - Critiques speculative or innovative language not rooted in Scripture.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not so much heard as overheard in the statements of Scripture." (The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity)

5. **Guarding Orthodox Terminology**
    - Advocates for precise use of terms like “person” and “essence” in Trinitarian theology.
    - Warns that novel language (such as “one person” for God) risks confusion or error.
    - Holds that theological innovation must be tested by confessional standards.
    - Sees the church’s historic language as a safeguard for doctrinal fidelity.
    - "The terminology of the church is the outgrowth of its effort to express the truth of Scripture with precision and care." (The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s rigorous defense of **classical Trinitarianism** has shaped Reformed orthodoxy and set a high standard for doctrinal precision. His insistence on the careful use of **person** and **essence** continues to influence critiques of contemporary formulations, such as Van Til’s “one person” language. Warfield’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to confessional fidelity and the careful guarding of the boundaries of **orthodox theology**. His work remains a touchstone for evaluating both innovation and continuity in Trinitarian doctrine.
