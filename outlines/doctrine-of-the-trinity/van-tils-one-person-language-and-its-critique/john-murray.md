# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray critically engaged with **Cornelius Van Til’s** use of **one person language** in Trinitarian theology, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the classical **Reformed doctrine** of three persons in one essence. Murray was deeply committed to preserving the **ontological unity** and **personal distinctions** within the **Trinity**, warning against any formulation that might imply **modalism** or compromise the eternal distinctions among Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

- "The unity of the Godhead must never be conceived in such terms as to obscure the real and eternal distinctions subsisting within the Trinity." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "The Nature and Unity of the Church" (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "Christian Faith and the Truthfulness of Divine Revelation" (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT Commentary)
- John Frame, *Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought* (secondary, for context on the debate)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Three Persons, One Essence**
   - Emphasizes the **co-equality and co-eternity** of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
   - Rejects any language that conflates the **personal distinctions** within the Godhead.
   - Affirms the **Nicene and Athanasian Creeds** as faithful expressions of Trinitarian doctrine.
   - Warns against formulations that could be construed as **modalistic**.
   "The doctrine of the Trinity means that the unity of the Godhead is not a unity of person but a unity of essence." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Guarding Against Modalism**
   - Critiques Van Til’s "one person" language as potentially undermining **personal plurality**.
   - Stresses the necessity of maintaining **real distinctions** among the persons.
   - Argues that biblical revelation supports both **unity and diversity** in God.
   - Insists that theological language must not obscure the **eternal generation** and **procession**.
   "We must not allow the unity of God to swallow up the distinctions of persons." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Biblical and Confessional Fidelity**
   - Grounds Trinitarian language in **Scripture** and **historic confessions**.
   - Upholds the **Westminster Confession of Faith** as a standard for doctrinal clarity.
   - Critiques speculative or novel formulations not rooted in the biblical text.
   - Seeks to avoid both **subordinationism** and **modalism** in Trinitarian theology.
   "Our formulations must be governed by the pattern of sound words found in Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Theological Precision in Language**
   - Advocates for careful use of **technical terms** to avoid confusion.
   - Recognizes the limits of human language in describing the **mystery of the Trinity**.
   - Encourages theologians to use established terminology to safeguard orthodoxy.
   - Warns that imprecise language can lead to doctrinal error or misunderstanding.
   "Precision in theological language is not pedantry but a safeguard for the truth." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Unity and Diversity in God**
   - Affirms that **unity and diversity** are equally ultimate in the Godhead.
   - Rejects any approach that privileges unity at the expense of diversity, or vice versa.
   - Sees the **Trinitarian relations** as foundational for Christian doctrine and worship.
   - Insists that the mystery of the Trinity must be preserved, not rationalized away.
   "The mystery of the Trinity is that God is both one and three, and neither aspect may be compromised." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s careful critique of Van Til’s **one person language** has shaped subsequent Reformed discussions on the **doctrine of the Trinity**, reinforcing the necessity of confessional and biblical precision. His insistence on maintaining both the unity and the personal distinctions within the Godhead has served as a corrective against modalism and doctrinal innovation. Murray’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment of Reformed theologians to uphold the classical doctrine of the Trinity with clarity and reverence.
