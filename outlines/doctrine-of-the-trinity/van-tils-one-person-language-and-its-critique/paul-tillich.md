# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich addressed the question of **divine personhood** by emphasizing the **ontological distinction** between God and creatures, rejecting literal or anthropomorphic descriptions of God. In response to Van Til’s **one person language** regarding the Trinity, Tillich argued that God is the **Ground of Being** and transcends finite categories such as personhood, insisting that all language about God is **symbolic** and points beyond itself.

- "It is as the ground of the structure of being that God is the ground of the structure of personality." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God as the Ground of Being**
    - God is not a being among beings but the very basis of all existence.
    - Divine reality transcends all finite categories, including personhood.
    - The term "person" applied to God is symbolic, not literal.
    - Human language about God must avoid reducing God to creaturely terms.
    - "God is being-itself, not a being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Symbolic Language in Theology**
    - All language about God is necessarily symbolic and points beyond itself.
    - "Person" as applied to God expresses relationship, not ontological identity.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point but are not identical with it.
    - Literalism in theological language leads to idolatry or conceptual distortion.
    - "The language of faith is the language of symbol." (Dynamics of Faith)

3. **Critique of Anthropomorphism**
    - Anthropomorphic language about God is unavoidable but must be critically examined.
    - Overemphasis on God as "one person" risks collapsing the Creator-creature distinction.
    - Theological language must preserve divine transcendence and mystery.
    - The Trinity should not be reduced to three human-like persons.
    - "Anthropomorphism is unavoidable, but it must be overcome by critical reflection." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Existential-ontological Approach to the Trinity**
    - The Trinity expresses the relational and dynamic character of the divine life.
    - Trinitarian language is a symbol for the depth and complexity of divine reality.
    - The "one person" language is inadequate for expressing the richness of the Trinity.
    - The Trinity points to the unity and diversity within the divine Ground of Being.
    - "The trinitarian symbols are expressions of the divine self-manifestation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Rejection of Literal Personhood in God**
    - God is not a person in the sense of a finite, individual subject.
    - Divine personhood is a metaphor for the personal dimension of ultimate reality.
    - The personal is rooted in the impersonal Ground of Being.
    - Theological language must always point beyond itself to the ineffable.
    - "God is not a person, but he is not less than personal." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s critique of **Van Til’s one person language** has significantly shaped modern discussions on the limits of theological language and the dangers of anthropomorphism in **Trinitarian theology**. His emphasis on the **symbolic** and **ontological** dimensions of God-talk has influenced existential and liberal theological traditions. While some see his approach as a corrective to overly literalist tendencies, others argue it risks undermining the personal nature of the Christian God. Tillich’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the adequacy of human language for expressing the mystery of the divine.
