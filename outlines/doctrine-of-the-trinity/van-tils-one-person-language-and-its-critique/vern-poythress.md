# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress has engaged deeply with **Cornelius Van Til’s** use of **one person language** in Trinitarian theology, seeking to clarify and defend Van Til’s approach while addressing its critics. Poythress emphasizes the importance of **biblical language**, **mystery**, and **analogical reasoning** in articulating the doctrine of the **Trinity**, arguing that Van Til’s formulations, though controversial, aim to safeguard both **unity and diversity** in God.

- "Van Til’s language about the Trinity is best understood as an attempt to be faithful to the biblical data, even when it resists neat systematic categorization." ("Reforming Ontology and Logic in the Light of the Trinity: An Application of Van Til’s Idea of Analogy," Westminster Theological Journal 57, 1995)

## Key Works

- "Reforming Ontology and Logic in the Light of the Trinity: An Application of Van Til’s Idea of Analogy" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1995)
- "The Mystery of the Trinity: A Trinitarian Approach to the Attributes of God" (2020)
- "Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology" (1987)
- "Logic: A God-Centered Approach to the Foundation of Western Thought" (2013)
- "In the Beginning Was the Word: Language—A God-Centered Approach" (2009)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of Van Til’s Analogical Approach**
   - Emphasizes that human knowledge of God is always **analogical**, not univocal.
   - Defends Van Til’s use of **one person language** as a way to express the incomprehensible unity of the Godhead.
   - Argues that analogical language preserves both **mystery** and **revelation** in Trinitarian doctrine.
   - Insists that theological language must be governed by **Scripture** rather than philosophical categories.
   - "Van Til’s analogical approach is not a confusion of categories, but a recognition of the Creator-creature distinction." (WTJ 57, 1995)

2. **Commitment to Biblical Language and Categories**
   - Advocates for using **biblical terms** to describe the Trinity, even when they challenge systematic precision.
   - Warns against imposing extrabiblical philosophical distinctions onto the doctrine of God.
   - Sees Van Til’s language as an attempt to remain close to the **biblical witness**.
   - Encourages humility in the face of **mystery** rather than speculative systematization.
   - "We must let the Bible set the agenda for our theological formulations, especially in matters as profound as the Trinity." (The Mystery of the Trinity, 2020)

3. **Defense of Trinitarian Mystery**
   - Argues that the **Trinity** is ultimately mysterious and cannot be fully captured by human categories.
   - Sees Van Til’s one person language as a way to honor the **mystery** of divine unity and diversity.
   - Rejects the charge that Van Til’s language leads to **modalism** or **confusion of persons**.
   - Maintains that theological paradox is sometimes necessary to do justice to biblical revelation.
   - "Mystery is not a defect in doctrine, but a reflection of the infinite majesty of God." (The Mystery of the Trinity, 2020)

4. **Critique of Rationalistic Objections**
   - Responds to critics who accuse Van Til of logical incoherence.
   - Argues that **human logic** is subordinate to the **Trinitarian God** and must be reformed accordingly.
   - Suggests that apparent contradictions in Van Til’s language arise from the limits of human understanding.
   - Proposes a **God-centered logic** that accommodates biblical paradoxes.
   - "Logic itself must be reformed in the light of the Trinity, not the other way around." (Logic, 2013)

5. **Emphasis on Unity and Diversity in God**
   - Affirms that Van Til’s language seeks to uphold both the **unity of essence** and the **distinction of persons**.
   - Warns against overemphasizing either unity or diversity to the detriment of the other.
   - Sees the **one person** language as a way to express the profound unity of the Godhead without denying personal distinctions.
   - Argues that theological formulations must reflect the **fullness of biblical teaching** on the Trinity.
   - "The challenge is to affirm both the unity and the diversity of God as revealed in Scripture, without collapsing one into the other." (Symphonic Theology, 1987)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s engagement with Van Til’s **one person language** has provided a nuanced defense of Van Til’s Trinitarian theology, especially within the Reformed tradition. His work has encouraged theologians to approach the doctrine of the Trinity with both **biblical fidelity** and philosophical humility. By emphasizing **analogical reasoning** and the limits of human logic, Poythress has contributed to a more robust appreciation of theological mystery. His writings continue to shape discussions on the relationship between **systematic theology** and **biblical revelation**.
