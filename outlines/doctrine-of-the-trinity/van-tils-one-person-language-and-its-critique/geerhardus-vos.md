# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos, while not directly engaging Cornelius Van Til’s **one person language** in Trinitarian theology, laid foundational work in **Reformed dogmatics** and **biblical theology** that shaped later discussions. Vos emphasized the **organic unity of revelation** and the **self-disclosure of God** in history, providing categories that influenced Van Til’s approach to the **Trinity** and the relationship between **unity and diversity** in God. Vos’s theological method and his understanding of **progressive revelation** indirectly inform critiques and appreciations of Van Til’s language regarding the **ontological Trinity**.

- "The revelation of God is always the revelation of the one true God, yet it is never abstract, but always concrete and personal." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics (esp. Vol. 1: Theology Proper)
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
    - Revelation unfolds as a unified, progressive whole, not as isolated propositions.
    - The **Trinity** is revealed organically through redemptive history.
    - Unity and diversity in revelation reflect the unity and diversity in God Himself.
    - This organic approach resists abstract or purely philosophical formulations of God’s being.
    - "Revelation is not a series of disconnected acts, but a living organism." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Self-Disclosure of the Triune God**
    - God reveals Himself personally and covenantally, not impersonally.
    - The persons of the **Trinity** are known through their redemptive roles.
    - Divine self-disclosure is always as the one true God, yet never in abstraction from the three persons.
    - Vos’s framework supports a robust personalism in Trinitarian theology.
    - "God is never revealed as an abstract essence, but always as the living God in relation to His people." (Reformed Dogmatics)

3. **Rejection of Rationalistic Abstraction**
    - Vos warns against reducing God to philosophical categories.
    - Theological language must be governed by the pattern of biblical revelation.
    - The mystery of the Trinity is preserved by refusing to collapse personhood into essence or vice versa.
    - This stance provides a caution against both modalism and tritheism.
    - "The mystery of the Trinity is not to be solved by human reason, but received in faith." (Reformed Dogmatics)

4. **Covenantal Context for Personhood**
    - Personhood is understood within the context of God’s covenant dealings.
    - The persons of the Trinity are revealed in their distinct covenantal roles.
    - The unity of God is not impersonal, but the unity of three persons in covenantal relationship.
    - This shapes how one speaks of the “person” of God and avoids confusion with human personhood.
    - "The covenant is the form in which the personal God relates to His people." (The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology)

5. **Scriptural Patterning of Theological Language**
    - The language of theology must be patterned after Scripture, not speculative philosophy.
    - Vos insists on the primacy of biblical categories in articulating the doctrine of God.
    - This approach guards against both over-simplification and over-complication in Trinitarian language.
    - It encourages careful distinction between **ontological** and **economic** Trinitarian relations.
    - "Theology must derive its language and concepts from the pattern of Scripture itself." ("The Idea of Biblical Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s emphasis on the **organic unity of revelation** and the personal, covenantal nature of God’s self-disclosure provided crucial categories for later Reformed theologians, including Van Til. While Vos did not directly address Van Til’s **one person language**, his approach to **Trinitarian theology** set boundaries for how personhood and unity should be discussed. Vos’s influence is evident in the way Reformed theology seeks to balance biblical fidelity with doctrinal precision, especially regarding the mystery of the **Trinity**. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to scripturally grounded, historically aware theological reflection.
