# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. critically engages with **Cornelius Van Til’s** use of **one person language** regarding the **ontological Trinity**, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining classical distinctions between **essence** and **person**. Gaffin upholds orthodox **Trinitarianism** and warns that innovative terminology can risk confusion about the real distinctions among the **Trinitarian persons**.

- "Van Til’s formulation, while motivated by a desire to safeguard the full deity of each person, risks blurring the real distinctions among the persons of the Godhead." (Gaffin, "Van Til, Calvin, and the Trinity," Westminster Theological Journal 56)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of Classical Trinitarian Distinctions**
   - Emphasizes the necessity of the **distinction between essence and persons** in the Trinity.
   - Warns against collapsing the three persons into a single person.
   - Argues that classical language (one essence, three persons) is biblically and confessionally grounded.
   - Sees Van Til’s one person language as potentially confusing, though well-intentioned.
   "The church’s creedal language, ‘one essence in three persons,’ remains the most faithful summary of biblical teaching." (WTJ 56)

2. **Sympathetic Critique of Van Til**
   - Recognizes Van Til’s desire to uphold the **full deity of each person**.
   - Understands Van Til’s language as a reaction to modernist distortions of the Trinity.
   - Critiques the lack of precision in Van Til’s use of "person" for both the Trinity and its members.
   - Suggests that Van Til’s formulation may unintentionally obscure orthodox distinctions.
   "Van Til’s approach, though motivated by apologetic concerns, requires careful qualification to avoid misunderstanding." (WTJ 56)

3. **Commitment to Confessional Orthodoxy**
   - Strongly upholds the **Nicene and Chalcedonian** formulations of the Trinity.
   - Insists that theological innovation must not undermine historic creedal boundaries.
   - Views the **Westminster Standards** as reliable guides for Trinitarian language.
   - Encourages retrieval of classical categories for clarity and fidelity.
   "The confessions provide a necessary safeguard against both modalism and tritheism." (WTJ 56)

4. **Theological Method: Analogy and Mystery**
   - Stresses the **analogical nature of theological language** about God.
   - Affirms the incomprehensibility of the Trinity while maintaining revealed distinctions.
   - Warns against speculative or overly rationalistic approaches to Trinitarian doctrine.
   - Sees mystery as essential to orthodox Trinitarian confession.
   "We must confess what Scripture reveals, even as we acknowledge the mystery that remains." (WTJ 56)

5. **Pastoral and Apologetic Sensitivity**
   - Appreciates Van Til’s apologetic aims in defending the Trinity against rationalist critique.
   - Urges that theological language serve the church’s worship and catechesis.
   - Advocates for formulations that are both faithful and accessible to the church.
   - Sees clarity in Trinitarian language as vital for both doctrine and devotion.
   "Our language about the Trinity must serve the church’s confession and worship, not merely academic debate." (WTJ 56)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s engagement with **Van Til’s one person language** has clarified the boundaries of **Reformed Trinitarian orthodoxy** and encouraged a return to classical creedal formulations. His influence is evident in contemporary discussions at Westminster and beyond, where his insistence on doctrinal precision and pastoral clarity continues to shape theological education and confessional fidelity.
