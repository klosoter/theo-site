# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas, as a foundational figure in **classical theism** and **Trinitarian theology**, articulated a doctrine of the **Trinity** that emphasizes the distinction of **persons** within the unity of the **divine essence**. Aquinas’s approach stands in contrast to Van Til’s “one person” language, as Aquinas insists that the **divine persons** are not merely modes or manifestations, but real distinctions within the Godhead, grounded in **relations of origin**. His framework resists collapsing the persons into a single subject, maintaining both unity and real personal distinction.

- "There are three who are called persons in God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and each of these is one God, and all together are one God." (Summa Theologiae I, q.30, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, I, Questions 27–43 (On the Trinity)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 1–27
- De Trinitate (Commentary on Boethius)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book I, Distinctions 25–27
- The Oxford Handbook of Aquinas (ed. Davies & Stump, for secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Real Distinction of Persons**
    - The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are truly distinct as **persons**, not merely as roles or manifestations.
    - Distinction is grounded in **relations of origin** (paternity, filiation, procession).
    - The divine essence is numerically one, but the persons are not reducible to the essence.
    - Each person possesses the fullness of the divine nature, yet is not the other.
    - "Person in God signifies a relation as subsisting in the divine nature." (Summa Theologiae I, q.29, a.4)

2. **Unity of Divine Essence**
    - There is only one **divine essence**, simple and indivisible.
    - The three persons share the same essence without division or composition.
    - The unity of God is not compromised by the plurality of persons.
    - Any language that suggests otherwise (e.g., “one person”) risks **Sabellianism** or modalism.
    - "In God there is one essence in three persons." (Summa Theologiae I, q.39, a.1)

3. **Processions and Relations**
    - The distinction of persons arises from two processions: **generation** (Son from Father) and **spiration** (Spirit from Father and Son).
    - These processions are internal and eternal, not temporal or external.
    - The relations (paternity, filiation, spiration) are real and constitute the persons.
    - The persons are not defined by actions in the economy but by eternal relations.
    - "The divine persons are distinguished by the relations of origin alone." (Summa Theologiae I, q.28, a.3)

4. **Rejection of Modalism**
    - Aquinas explicitly rejects any view that collapses the persons into a single subject or “person.”
    - The persons are not mere modes or aspects of the one God.
    - Each person is a subsistent relation, not a functional mask.
    - The language of “one person” is inadequate and misleading for the Trinity.
    - "It is heretical to say that there is only one person in God." (Summa Theologiae I, q.30, a.1)

5. **Analogical Language and Mystery**
    - Human language about God is **analogical**, not univocal or equivocal.
    - Terms like “person” are used by analogy, recognizing the mystery of the divine nature.
    - The doctrine of the Trinity is ultimately a revealed mystery, not fully comprehensible by reason.
    - Theological language must safeguard both unity and distinction without confusion.
    - "We cannot know what God is, but only what He is not." (Summa Contra Gentiles I, ch.30)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s rigorous articulation of the **Trinitarian persons** has shaped the Western tradition’s resistance to both **modalism** and tritheism. His insistence on real distinctions within the unity of the divine essence stands as a critical reference point in evaluating later theological proposals, including Van Til’s “one person” language. Aquinas’s influence endures in both Roman Catholic and broader Christian dogmatics, providing a framework for understanding the mystery of the Trinity that prioritizes both unity and real personal distinction. His approach remains a standard for critiquing any formulation that risks undermining the classical doctrine of the **Trinity**.
