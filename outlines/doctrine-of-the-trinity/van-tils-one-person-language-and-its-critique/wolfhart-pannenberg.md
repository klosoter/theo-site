# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg critically engaged with **Cornelius Van Til’s** insistence on the **one person language** in Trinitarian theology, arguing that such formulations risk undermining the **distinction of persons** within the **Trinity**. Pannenberg emphasized the importance of **relationality** and the **historical self-revelation of God** as foundational for understanding the triune God, contending that Van Til’s approach could collapse the richness of Trinitarian relations into a problematic unity. He advocated for a **social model of the Trinity** that preserves both unity and distinction without resorting to modalism or tritheism.

- "The unity of God is not a unity of substance but a unity of persons in their relations to each other." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially sections on the Trinity)
- Jesus—God and Man
- Theology and the Kingdom of God
- The Idea of God and Human Freedom
- "The Appropriation of the Trinity in Modern Theology" (essay in The Trinity: An Interdisciplinary Symposium on the Trinity)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Unity as Relational**
    - God’s unity is constituted by the **relations of Father, Son, and Spirit**.
    - Rejects any reduction of the Trinity to a mere **monopersonal** unity.
    - Emphasizes the **perichoretic** (mutual indwelling) nature of the divine persons.
    - Argues that Van Til’s “one person” language risks obscuring the real distinctions.
    - "The unity of the divine essence is a unity of persons in their mutual relations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Historical Revelation as the Basis for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - The doctrine of the Trinity arises from God’s **self-revelation in history**.
    - Christ’s resurrection is central to understanding the triune God.
    - Critiques speculative approaches that are not grounded in **salvation history**.
    - Sees Van Til’s formulation as insufficiently attentive to the historical unfolding of revelation.
    - "Only in the history of Jesus does the triune God reveal himself." (Jesus—God and Man)

3. **Critique of Modalism and Tritheism**
    - Warns against formulations that collapse the persons into one (modalism).
    - Equally rejects tritheistic tendencies that divide the Godhead.
    - Sees Van Til’s “one person” language as potentially modalistic.
    - Advocates for a **social analogy** that maintains both unity and distinction.
    - "The danger of modalism arises whenever the unity of God is conceived as a unity of person." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Personhood Defined by Relation**
    - Personhood in the Trinity is constituted by **mutual relations**, not by individual substance.
    - Each divine person is who they are in relation to the others.
    - The concept of “person” must be carefully distinguished from modern individualism.
    - Van Til’s language is critiqued for not adequately expressing this relational ontology.
    - "The concept of person must be understood as a being-in-relation." (Theology and the Kingdom of God)

5. **Theological Method: Openness to Revision**
    - Theology must remain open to **critical engagement** and revision in light of history and revelation.
    - Rejects static formulations that do not account for the dynamic nature of God’s self-disclosure.
    - Encourages dialogue with other theological traditions and contemporary philosophy.
    - Sees Van Til’s approach as too rigid and insufficiently dialogical.
    - "Theology must always be open to the future and to the ongoing self-revelation of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s critique of Van Til’s **one person language** has shaped contemporary discussions on the **doctrine of the Trinity**, especially in emphasizing the importance of relationality and historical revelation. His insistence on a **social model of the Trinity** has influenced both Protestant and ecumenical theology, encouraging a move away from overly abstract or monolithic conceptions of divine unity. Pannenberg’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to articulate the mystery of the triune God in a way that is both faithful to Scripture and responsive to modern concerns.
