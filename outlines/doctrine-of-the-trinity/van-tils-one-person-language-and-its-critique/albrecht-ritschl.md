# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl’s theology stands in marked contrast to **Van Til’s one person language** regarding the doctrine of God. Ritschl emphasized the **ethical personality of God** and the primacy of **religious experience** over metaphysical speculation, rejecting the scholastic and Reformed focus on **ontological distinctions** within the Trinity. He critiqued attempts to define God’s being in abstract, metaphysical terms, instead centering on the **revelation of God in Christ** as the basis for understanding divine personality.

- "We know God only in so far as He enters into communion with us in the kingdom of God." (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- Instruction in the Christian Religion (1875)
- The Theology of Albrecht Ritschl (Otto Ritschl, 1906)
- Three Lectures on Theology (1888)
- Ritschl in the Context of Modern Theology (secondary: Philip Hefner, 1966)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - Theology must be grounded in the **practical experience** of faith, not abstract metaphysics.
    - The knowledge of God is mediated through the **community of believers**.
    - **Doctrinal formulations** are secondary to the lived reality of Christian fellowship.
    - The **kingdom of God** is the central category for understanding divine action.
    - "Theology is not a science of the infinite, but of the God who reveals Himself in the history of salvation." (Instruction in the Christian Religion)

2. **Ethical Personality of God**
    - God is known as **personal** and **ethical**, not as an abstract substance.
    - The divine will is revealed in the **moral order** and in Christ’s example.
    - The **attributes of God** are interpreted through His relation to humanity.
    - Ritschl rejects speculative Trinitarianism in favor of God’s **practical relation** to the world.
    - "God is for us the God of the kingdom, the loving will who seeks our good." (Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Christocentric Revelation**
    - Christ is the **decisive revelation** of God’s character and purpose.
    - The **person of Christ** is central, rather than metaphysical speculation about the Trinity.
    - The meaning of God’s personhood is disclosed in the **historical Jesus**.
    - The **work of Christ** is interpreted in terms of establishing the kingdom, not ontological mediation.
    - "In Christ, God’s love and purpose for humanity are made manifest." (Justification and Reconciliation)

4. **Rejection of Metaphysical Speculation**
    - Ritschl opposes the use of **Greek metaphysics** in Christian doctrine.
    - He critiques the **scholastic tradition** for obscuring the practical meaning of faith.
    - Theological language should serve the **life of the church**, not abstract theory.
    - The **Trinity** is not a speculative doctrine but a confession of God’s work in salvation.
    - "The metaphysical doctrine of the Trinity is not essential to Christian faith." (Instruction in the Christian Religion)

5. **Doctrine of the Trinity as Functional**
    - The **Trinity** is understood in terms of God’s **self-revelation** in history.
    - Ritschl denies the necessity of **ontological distinctions** within the Godhead.
    - The language of **personhood** is meaningful only as it relates to God’s action for us.
    - The **unity of God** is preserved by focusing on His purpose and will, not internal relations.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity must be interpreted as the expression of God’s historical revelation, not as a metaphysical mystery." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s emphasis on the **ethical personality of God** and his rejection of metaphysical speculation profoundly shaped modern liberal theology. His approach stands in sharp contrast to Van Til’s **one person language**, as Ritschl prioritized the practical and historical over the ontological and speculative. While his views were critiqued for lacking doctrinal depth, Ritschl’s focus on the **kingdom of God** and the centrality of Christ’s revelation influenced generations of theologians seeking to relate faith to modern experience. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of **doctrinal language** and the role of metaphysics in theology.
