# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher’s approach to the doctrine of the **Trinity** centers on the primacy of **religious experience** and the **feeling of absolute dependence**, rather than on metaphysical speculation about the divine essence or persons. He was critical of traditional formulations, including the **one person language** later used by Van Til, arguing that such language risks collapsing the distinctions necessary for genuine **Trinitarianism**. Schleiermacher’s theology thus reinterprets the meaning and necessity of **Trinitarian dogma** within the framework of Christian consciousness.

- "The dogmatic construction of the doctrine of the Trinity presents itself as a problem only when it is regarded as a necessary element in the system of doctrine." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - Doctrine must arise from the self-consciousness of the Christian community.
    - The **feeling of absolute dependence** is foundational for all theology.
    - Doctrinal formulations are secondary to lived faith and experience.
    - The Trinity is not a speculative doctrine but an expression of communal faith.
    - "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech."

2. **Critique of Metaphysical Trinitarianism**
    - Traditional Trinitarian language is seen as speculative and non-essential.
    - The concept of "one person" in God is viewed as problematic and unnecessary.
    - Emphasizes the unity of God over metaphysical distinctions of persons.
    - The Trinity is not essential for the essence of Christian faith.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity did not form part of the original message of Christianity."

3. **Christology as the Center of Doctrine**
    - Christ is the archetype of God-consciousness, not a metaphysical person of the Trinity.
    - The significance of Christ lies in his unique God-consciousness.
    - The relationship between Christ and God is paradigmatic for believers.
    - Trinitarian language is subordinated to the centrality of Christ’s experience.
    - "The Redeemer is distinguished from all others by the constant potency of his God-consciousness."

4. **Doctrine as Expression, Not Explanation**
    - Doctrines express the communal religious life, not metaphysical realities.
    - Theological language is symbolic and functional, not ontological.
    - The Trinity is a way of expressing the communal experience of salvation.
    - Rejects speculative explanations of divine persons and essence.
    - "Dogmatic theology is the science which systematizes the doctrine prevalent in the Church at any given time."

5. **Rejection of Speculative Personhood in God**
    - The notion of "person" applied to God is anthropomorphic and misleading.
    - One person language risks modalism or undermines genuine distinction.
    - The unity of God is preserved by avoiding speculative personhood.
    - Trinitarian distinctions should not be pressed beyond their experiential basis.
    - "The concept of person, as applied to God, is not to be taken in the same sense as when applied to men."

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **Trinitarian doctrine** profoundly influenced modern theology, shifting the focus from metaphysical speculation to **religious experience** and communal consciousness. His critique of speculative personhood in God laid the groundwork for later liberal and existential approaches to the Trinity. While often criticized by confessional theologians, his emphasis on the expressive and experiential dimensions of doctrine continues to shape contemporary discussions on the nature and necessity of **Trinitarian language**.
