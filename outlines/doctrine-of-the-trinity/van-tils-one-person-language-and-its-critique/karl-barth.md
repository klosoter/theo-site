# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth critically engaged with **Cornelius Van Til’s** use of **one person language** in Trinitarian theology, arguing that it risks collapsing the distinction between the **divine persons** and undermining the richness of **Trinitarian revelation**. Barth maintained that the **doctrine of the Trinity** must preserve both the unity and the distinctiveness of the persons, and he saw Van Til’s formulation as problematic for classical **Reformed orthodoxy**.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a mathematical problem, but the expression of the fact that God is God in His revelation." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Karl Barth: Against Hegemony (George Hunsinger)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Distinction Must Be Preserved**
    - Emphasizes that the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** are truly distinct persons, not merely modes or manifestations.
    - Critiques any language that suggests a single "person" in God, as it risks **modalism**.
    - Argues that revelation itself is tri-personal, not reducible to a single subject.
    - Insists that the **immanent Trinity** is the basis for understanding the **economic Trinity**.
    - "The one God is not solitary; He is the one who lives in the fellowship of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Revelation as the Basis for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Asserts that all knowledge of God, including the Trinity, comes through **revelation**.
    - Opposes speculative or philosophical approaches that go beyond what is revealed in Christ.
    - Sees Van Til’s approach as insufficiently grounded in the event of revelation.
    - Maintains that the **Word of God** is the self-disclosure of the triune God.
    - "God reveals Himself. He reveals Himself through Himself. He reveals Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **Critique of Philosophical Abstraction**
    - Warns against abstract formulations of the Trinity that are detached from biblical revelation.
    - Argues that "one person" language can lead to conceptual confusion.
    - Stresses the importance of **biblical language** and categories in Trinitarian theology.
    - Sees Van Til’s formulation as influenced by philosophical rather than exegetical concerns.
    - "We must not allow ourselves to be led astray by the word 'person' into thinking of three individuals." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

4. **Christocentric Approach to the Trinity**
    - Centers all doctrine, including the Trinity, on the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Holds that the revelation of the Trinity is inseparable from the incarnation and redemptive history.
    - Critiques approaches that abstract the Trinity from the concrete reality of Christ.
    - Argues that Van Til’s language risks obscuring the centrality of Christ in revelation.
    - "It is in Jesus Christ that God reveals Himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

5. **Commitment to Classical Reformed Orthodoxy**
    - Affirms the **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** formulations of the Trinity.
    - Sees Van Til’s innovation as a departure from historic confessional standards.
    - Emphasizes the importance of doctrinal continuity with the broader Christian tradition.
    - Argues that the mystery of the Trinity must be preserved, not rationalized.
    - "The Church confesses the triune God, not as a problem to be solved, but as the mystery of its faith." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s critique of Van Til’s **one person language** has shaped ongoing debates about the proper articulation of the **doctrine of the Trinity** within Reformed and evangelical circles. His insistence on the distinction of persons and the centrality of revelation has influenced both systematic theology and ecumenical dialogue. Barth’s approach continues to serve as a corrective against reductionist or overly philosophical accounts of the Trinity, reinforcing the importance of biblical and confessional fidelity.
