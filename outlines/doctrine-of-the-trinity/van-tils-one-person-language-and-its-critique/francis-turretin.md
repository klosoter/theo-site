# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a classical understanding of the **Trinity** that emphasized the distinction of **persons** within the unity of the **divine essence**. Turretin’s approach stands in contrast to later formulations, such as **Van Til’s “one person” language**, which he would likely critique as a confusion of the classical categories of **person** and **essence**. Turretin’s careful distinctions aimed to safeguard both the unity and the personal distinctions within the Godhead.

- "We must distinguish between the essence, which is one, and the persons, which are three; neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- The Doctrine of the Trinity in Reformed Orthodoxy (secondary: Richard Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics)
- The Westminster Confession of Faith (as interpreted and defended by Turretin)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Essence and Persons**
    - The **divine essence** is numerically one, shared wholly and indivisibly by the three persons.
    - Each **person** (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) is distinguished by personal properties, not by essence or degree.
    - The **unity** of God is not compromised by the personal distinctions.
    - Confusing person and essence leads to either **Sabellianism** or **tritheism**.
    - "The essence is communicated, the persons are distinguished; the essence is one, the persons are three." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

2. **Classical Definition of Person**
    - A **person** is defined as a distinct subsistence in the divine essence, not a mode or attribute.
    - The term “person” is used analogically, not univocally, with respect to God and creatures.
    - Each person possesses the whole divine essence, yet is not the other persons.
    - The **Father** is unbegotten, the **Son** begotten, and the **Spirit** proceeds—these are distinguishing properties.
    - "A person in the Godhead is the incommunicable subsistence of the divine essence, distinguished by a peculiar property." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

3. **Rejection of Modalism and Confusion of Categories**
    - Turretin rejects any language that blurs the distinction between **person** and **essence**.
    - He critiques **modalism** as denying real distinctions in the Godhead.
    - The “one person” language would be seen as a category error, collapsing the three into one.
    - Proper Trinitarian language must preserve both unity and distinction.
    - "We must avoid both the error of those who confound the persons and those who divide the essence." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

4. **Scriptural and Confessional Fidelity**
    - Turretin grounds his Trinitarian theology in **Scripture** and the **ecumenical creeds**.
    - He upholds the formulations of **Nicaea** and **Chalcedon** as faithful summaries.
    - The **Westminster Confession** is interpreted in light of classical distinctions.
    - Any innovation in language must be tested by these standards.
    - "We must speak of God as he has revealed himself, not according to human invention." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

5. **Theological Method and Caution in Language**
    - Turretin insists on precise theological language to avoid heresy.
    - He warns against speculative or novel terminology in **Trinitarian doctrine**.
    - Theological terms must be defined and used consistently.
    - The mystery of the Trinity is to be confessed, not rationalized away.
    - "In divine things, we must be content with the limits of revelation and the words of Scripture." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of the **Trinitarian distinctions** became foundational for later **Reformed orthodoxy** and confessional theology. His careful separation of **essence** and **person** has shaped the way Reformed theologians critique any language—such as Van Til’s “one person” formulation—that risks blurring these categories. Turretin’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of the Trinity, where his commitment to classical terminology and confessional fidelity continues to serve as a benchmark for orthodoxy.
