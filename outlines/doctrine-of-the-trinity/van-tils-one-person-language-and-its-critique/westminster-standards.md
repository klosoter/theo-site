# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a **classical doctrine of the Trinity**, emphasizing the distinction between the **one essence** and **three persons** of the Godhead. In contrast to Van Til’s “one person” language, the Standards maintain the traditional terminology, carefully avoiding any conflation of **person** and **being** in Trinitarian theology.

- "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost." (Westminster Confession of Faith II.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (1647)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (1647)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- The Directory for Public Worship (for Trinitarian liturgical formulations)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction of Persons**
   - The Standards uphold a real distinction among the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit**.
   - Each person is fully and equally God, sharing the same **divine essence**.
   - The term “person” is used to avoid modalism and tritheism.
   - The persons are distinguished by their **personal properties** (paternity, filiation, procession).
   - "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons..." (WCF II.3)

2. **Unity of Essence**
   - There is but **one God**, not three gods.
   - The divine essence is indivisible and shared wholly by each person.
   - The Standards reject any division or composition in God.
   - The unity of essence is foundational to all Trinitarian formulations.
   - "There is but one only, living, and true God..." (WCF II.1)

3. **Terminological Precision**
   - The Standards use “person” and “essence” with deliberate care.
   - “Person” is not synonymous with “being” or “individual.”
   - The language guards against both **Sabellianism** and **Arianism**.
   - Any innovation in terminology is viewed with caution to preserve orthodoxy.
   - "God is a Spirit, in and of himself infinite in being and perfection..." (WCF II.1)

4. **Rejection of Confusion of Persons**
   - The Standards explicitly deny the conflation of the persons into a single person.
   - Each person is neither blended nor confused with the others.
   - The “one person” language is absent and implicitly critiqued by the Standards’ formulations.
   - The doctrine upholds the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the persons.
   - "The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son." (WLC Q.11)

5. **Orthodox Trinitarianism**
   - The Standards align with the **Nicene** and **Athanasius** Creeds.
   - They affirm the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity.
   - The confession is wary of speculative or novel formulations.
   - The doctrine is intended to be both doxological and confessional.
   - "Which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable dependence on him." (WLC Q.9)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have provided a **normative framework** for Reformed Trinitarian theology, shaping confessional identity and doctrinal boundaries. Their careful distinction between **essence** and **person** has served as a benchmark for evaluating later theological innovations, including Van Til’s “one person” language. The Standards’ influence endures in Presbyterian and Reformed churches, ensuring that classical Trinitarian formulations remain central to their confessions and catechesis. Their legacy is one of doctrinal clarity and fidelity to historic Christian orthodoxy.
