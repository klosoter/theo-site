# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed doctrine of God** that emphasizes the **unity of the divine essence** and the **distinction of persons** within the **Trinity**. While these confessions do not directly engage with **Van Til’s one person language**, they provide a framework that critiques any formulation that might blur the classical distinction between the **one essence** and **three persons** of the Godhead.

- "We believe in one only God, who is one single essence, in which are three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct according to their incommunicable properties." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 8–11
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), Lord’s Day 8
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), Rejection of Errors, First Head
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English edition)
- The Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions (ed. Schaff, for historical context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **One Divine Essence, Three Distinct Persons**
   - Affirms the **unity of God’s essence** and the **real distinction** of persons.
   - Rejects any confusion or blending of the persons into a single person.
   - Upholds the **incommunicable properties** of Father, Son, and Spirit.
   - Insists that each person is fully God, yet there is only one God.
   - "In this one only God, there are three persons, truly, really, and eternally distinct." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

2. **Rejection of Modalism and Sabellianism**
   - Explicitly denies that God is one person appearing in three modes.
   - Warns against any language that collapses the persons into one.
   - Maintains that the **Trinitarian persons** are not mere manifestations.
   - The distinction is not nominal but actual and eternal.
   - "We do not say that God is three persons in the sense that men are three individuals, but that the divine essence is communicated to three persons." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

3. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Distinctions**
   - Grounds the doctrine of the Trinity in **biblical revelation**.
   - Cites both Old and New Testament texts for the plurality and unity of God.
   - Emphasizes the **baptismal formula** and apostolic benediction.
   - Argues that the church’s confession is faithful to Scripture.
   - "This doctrine of the holy Trinity has always been maintained and preserved in the true church." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

4. **Guarding the Mystery of the Trinity**
   - Acknowledges the **incomprehensibility** of the divine being.
   - Warns against speculative or philosophical distortions.
   - Encourages reverence and humility before the mystery of God.
   - Insists that confessional language is bounded by Scripture.
   - "We believe that by these means we know the Trinity, as far as it is revealed to us in God’s Word." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

5. **Confessional Precision in Trinitarian Language**
   - Uses the classical terms **essence** and **person** with care.
   - Avoids innovations that might confuse the church’s understanding.
   - Stresses the importance of **orthodox terminology** for unity and clarity.
   - Critiques formulations that risk undermining the **threefold personal distinction**.
   - "Therefore, in this respect, we rightly say that there are three persons in one only divine essence." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have set enduring boundaries for **Reformed Trinitarian theology**, shaping the church’s confession and catechesis for centuries. Their careful articulation of the **one essence/three persons** distinction stands as a critical reference point in evaluating later theological proposals, including Van Til’s "one person" language. By upholding classical categories, these confessions continue to inform and critique contemporary discussions, ensuring that the mystery and majesty of the Trinity remain central in Reformed thought.
