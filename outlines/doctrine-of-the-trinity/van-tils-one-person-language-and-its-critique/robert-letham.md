# Robert Letham (1947–)

Robert Letham critically engages Cornelius Van Til’s **one person language** regarding the **Trinity**, arguing that it risks undermining the classical doctrine of **three distinct persons** in the Godhead. Letham maintains that the historic **Nicene** and **Reformed** formulations provide a more theologically precise account of **Trinitarian personhood**, and he cautions against innovations that blur the distinction between **person** and **being** in God.

- "Van Til’s language of ‘one person’ is at best confusing and at worst misleading, since it threatens the orthodox distinction between person and essence." (The Holy Trinity, 2004)

## Key Works

- The Holy Trinity: In Scripture, History, Theology, and Worship (2004)
- Systematic Theology (2019)
- "The Trinity: How Not to Be a Heretic" (Westminster Theological Journal, 2003)
- "The Trinity and Van Til: An Analysis and Critique" (in Cornelius Van Til: Reformed Apologist and Churchman, ed. John R. Muether & Greg L. Bahnsen, 1999)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Classical Trinitarian Distinctions**
   - Emphasizes the **distinction between person and essence** in the Trinity.
   - Argues that Van Til’s language risks **modalism** or **confusion of persons**.
   - Upholds the **Nicene Creed** as the standard for Trinitarian orthodoxy.
   - Insists that each divine person is fully God, yet truly distinct.
   - "To speak of God as one person is to collapse the distinctions that are vital to the doctrine of the Trinity." (The Holy Trinity)

2. **Critique of Van Til’s Terminology**
   - Finds Van Til’s use of "one person" to be **ambiguous** and potentially misleading.
   - Warns that such language is not found in **historic confessions**.
   - Suggests that Van Til’s intent was to stress unity, but at the expense of clarity.
   - Argues that theological language must be carefully guarded to avoid error.
   - "Van Til’s terminology, while well-intentioned, is not only novel but also problematic." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Commitment to Historical Theology**
   - Grounds his critique in the **patristic and Reformed tradition**.
   - Draws on **Athanasius**, **Augustine**, and **the Cappadocians** for Trinitarian language.
   - Argues that innovation in Trinitarian terminology should be approached with caution.
   - Sees value in the **ecumenical creeds** as safeguards against heresy.
   - "The church’s historic formulations are not arbitrary but the result of careful theological reflection." (The Holy Trinity)

4. **Personhood in the Trinity**
   - Defines **person** (hypostasis) as a distinct, subsistent relation within the Godhead.
   - Rejects any reduction of personhood to mere modes or manifestations.
   - Affirms that the Father, Son, and Spirit are **coequal and coeternal**.
   - Insists that unity of essence does not negate real personal distinctions.
   - "Each person is not a part of God, but the whole God, yet truly distinct from the others." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Theological Method and Language**
   - Advocates for **precision in theological language** to avoid confusion.
   - Emphasizes the importance of **biblical and confessional fidelity**.
   - Warns against speculative or idiosyncratic formulations.
   - Encourages dialogue with the broader Christian tradition.
   - "Theological language must be both faithful to Scripture and consistent with the church’s confession." (The Holy Trinity)

## Legacy and Impact

Letham’s critique of Van Til’s **one person language** has reinforced the importance of classical Trinitarian distinctions within contemporary Reformed theology. His work has encouraged renewed attention to the **Nicene tradition** and the careful use of theological terminology. By engaging both Van Til’s apologetic concerns and the broader historical context, Letham has contributed to a more robust and orthodox understanding of the **Trinity** in modern systematic theology.
