# Scott Oliphint (1961– )

Scott Oliphint, a leading interpreter of **Cornelius Van Til**, has defended and clarified Van Til’s use of **one person language** in Trinitarian theology, arguing that it is a necessary outworking of **Reformed doctrine** and **presuppositional apologetics**. Oliphint maintains that Van Til’s approach upholds the **ontological unity** of the Godhead while safeguarding the distinctness of the **three persons**, and he responds to critiques by situating Van Til’s language within the broader context of **classical Trinitarian orthodoxy**.

- "Van Til’s insistence on the one person of God is not a departure from orthodoxy, but a necessary implication of the biblical doctrine of God as self-contained and absolute." (Reasons for Faith)

## Key Works

- K. Scott Oliphint, "Something Much Too Plain to Say": A Systematic Theological Analysis of Van Til’s Trinitarian Theology (WTJ, 2001)

- Cornelius Van Til and the Reformation of Christian Apologetics (in The Westminster Theological Journal, various articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of Ontological Trinity**
   - God is one in **essence** and three in **persons**, consistent with **Nicene orthodoxy**.
   - Van Til’s “one person” language is meant to emphasize the **unity** of God, not to collapse the persons.
   - Oliphint argues that this language is a safeguard against **tritheism**.
   - The unity of God’s **self-consciousness** is central to Van Til’s formulation.
   - "Van Til’s language is an attempt to express the absolute unity and simplicity of God without denying the real distinctions among the persons." (WTJ, 2001)

2. **Defense of Van Til’s Terminology**
   - Oliphint contends that Van Til’s “one person” language is misunderstood by critics.
   - He situates Van Til’s terms within the **Reformed confessional tradition**.
   - The language is not meant to introduce **modalism** or undermine the **personal distinctions**.
   - Oliphint provides historical and theological context to show continuity with **orthodox Trinitarianism**.
   - "The charge of modalism against Van Til is misplaced; his concern is to preserve the biblical doctrine of God’s unity." (Reasons for Faith)

3. **Covenantal Context for Trinitarian Language**
   - Oliphint emphasizes that Van Til’s theology is shaped by a **covenantal** framework.
   - The **self-revelation** of God in Scripture is always as the one true God, personally involved with His creation.
   - The “one person” language is intended to reflect God’s **personal** relationship with His people.
   - This approach grounds Trinitarian theology in **redemptive history**.
   - "Van Til’s covenantal context requires that we speak of God as the one personal God who relates to us in history." (Covenantal Apologetics)

4. **Presuppositional Apologetic Method**
   - Van Til’s Trinitarian language is inseparable from his **presuppositional apologetics**.
   - Oliphint argues that only the **triune God** provides the necessary precondition for knowledge and rationality.
   - The “one person” emphasis underscores the **absolute personality** of God as the foundation for all predication.
   - This method critiques both **rationalism** and **irrationalism** in non-Christian thought.
   - "The one-personal God of Van Til is the only sufficient ground for the intelligibility of human experience." (Reasons for Faith)

5. **Response to Critiques**
   - Oliphint addresses concerns from both **classical theists** and **analytic theologians**.
   - He clarifies that Van Til’s language is not a novel doctrine but a restatement of **biblical theism**.
   - Oliphint engages with critics such as **Ronald Nash** and **John Frame**, defending Van Til’s orthodoxy.
   - He calls for careful reading of Van Til in light of his broader theological commitments.
   - "Critics often fail to see that Van Til’s language is a polemical tool, not a metaphysical innovation." (WTJ, 2001)

## Legacy and Impact

Oliphint’s defense of Van Til’s **one person language** has significantly shaped contemporary discussions of **Reformed Trinitarianism** and apologetics. By clarifying Van Til’s intent and situating his terminology within the broader tradition, Oliphint has helped preserve Van Til’s influence among confessional theologians. His work continues to inform debates over the relationship between **unity and diversity** in the Godhead, and his engagement with critics has contributed to a more nuanced understanding of **presuppositional theology**.
