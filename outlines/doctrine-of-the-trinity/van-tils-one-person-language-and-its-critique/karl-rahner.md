# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the question of **Trinitarian personhood** with a distinctive emphasis on the unity of the **economic and immanent Trinity**, challenging any strict separation between the two. Rahner critiqued formulations, such as **Van Til’s “one person” language**, that risked collapsing the distinction between the **divine persons** or undermining the traditional doctrine of **hypostases**. For Rahner, the language of personhood must safeguard both the unity of God and the real distinctions within the **Trinity**.

- "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity." (The Trinity)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Economic and Immanent Trinity**
    - Rejects any dualism between God’s self-revelation in history and God’s eternal being.
    - Argues that what God reveals in salvation history is truly who God is.
    - Sees the **Trinitarian persons** as revealed through their missions in the world.
    - Insists that the **doctrine of the Trinity** must be rooted in God’s self-communication.
    - "The 'economic' Trinity is the 'immanent' Trinity and vice versa." (The Trinity)

2. **Personhood as Relation, Not Individuality**
    - Defines **person** (hypostasis) in the Trinity as a unique relation, not as a separate center of consciousness.
    - Warns against modern psychological notions of personhood when applied to God.
    - Emphasizes that the divine persons are not three individuals.
    - Critiques language that risks modalism or tritheism.
    - "The three persons are not three individuals, but three relations within the one divine being." (The Trinity)

3. **Critique of “One Person” Language**
    - Argues that calling God “one person” confuses the distinction between the **divine essence** and the **persons**.
    - Sees Van Til’s language as potentially undermining the real distinctions within the Trinity.
    - Maintains that the tradition speaks of one **ousia** (essence), not one person.
    - Stresses the importance of precise terminology to avoid heresy.
    - "The tradition does not say that God is one person, but that God is one being in three persons." (The Trinity)

4. **Revelation as Self-Communication**
    - Holds that God’s revelation is a genuine self-gift, not merely information about God.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit reveal the eternal processions.
    - The **Trinitarian distinctions** are made known in salvation history.
    - Revelation is both the source and norm for Trinitarian language.
    - "God’s self-communication is the basis for all our knowledge of the Trinity." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Pastoral and Existential Orientation**
    - Insists that Trinitarian doctrine must be meaningful for Christian life.
    - Sees the Trinity as the ground of human experience of grace.
    - Rejects speculative or abstract Trinitarianism disconnected from faith.
    - Emphasizes the existential encounter with the triune God.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not an abstract theory, but the expression of the Christian experience of God’s self-giving." (The Trinity)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s **Trinitarian theology** has profoundly shaped modern Catholic and ecumenical thought, especially through his insistence on the unity of the **economic and immanent Trinity**. His critique of inadequate or misleading person-language, such as Van Til’s “one person” formulation, has influenced ongoing debates about the proper articulation of **Trinitarian distinctions**. Rahner’s approach has encouraged theologians to ground doctrinal language in revelation and to maintain both the unity and relationality within the Godhead. His work remains a touchstone for discussions about the relevance and coherence of Trinitarian doctrine in contemporary theology.
