# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck’s doctrine of the **Trinity** is anchored in the unity of the **divine essence** and the real distinction of **three persons** within the Godhead. He affirms the classical formulation of one essence in three persons, warning against any language—such as Van Til’s “one person” terminology—that might obscure or collapse these distinctions. Bavinck’s approach safeguards both the unity and the personal plurality of God, emphasizing fidelity to **Scripture** and the **historic confessions**.

- "The personal distinctions are real and not merely nominal; the three persons are not simply three modes of revelation or three relations, but three subsistences within the one divine being." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

- "The Trinity" in Our Reasonable Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Classical Trinitarianism**
   - Upholds the **unity of essence** and **distinction of persons** as foundational to Trinitarian doctrine.
   - Rejects any formulation that diminishes the real personal distinctions within the Godhead.
   - Emphasizes that the **persons** are not mere modes or relations but true subsistences.
   - Sees the classical doctrine as a safeguard against both **modalism** and **tritheism**.
   "The church has always confessed one being in three persons, not three persons in one person." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Cautious Use of Personhood Language**
   - Warns against using “person” in a way that suggests modern individualism or psychological subjectivity.
   - Argues that the term “person” in Trinitarian theology is analogical and must be carefully defined.
   - Maintains that each divine person possesses the entire **divine essence**, not a part.
   - Critiques speculative or innovative language that risks confusion or heresy.
   "The word ‘person’ is not used in the same sense as when we speak of human persons." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Modalism**
   - Strongly opposes any view that reduces the three persons to mere manifestations or roles.
   - Insists that the distinctions are internal and eternal, not simply economic or functional.
   - Sees modalism as a denial of the richness of the biblical revelation of God.
   - Argues that modalistic tendencies undermine the reality of divine fellowship.
   "The three persons are not simply three modes of revelation or three relations, but three subsistences within the one divine being." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

4. **Balanced Emphasis on Unity and Diversity**
   - Stresses that both unity and diversity must be equally maintained in Trinitarian doctrine.
   - Warns that overemphasizing unity leads to **Sabellianism**, while overemphasizing diversity leads to **tritheism**.
   - Argues that the mystery of the Trinity is precisely in the coexistence of unity and personal distinction.
   - Sees the doctrine as rooted in **Scripture** and the **historic creeds**.
   "The unity of the divine being does not exclude the personal distinctions; rather, it requires them." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

5. **Critique of Van Til’s “One Person” Language**
   - Expresses concern that calling God “one person” risks confusing the classical distinctions.
   - Argues that such language may unintentionally suggest **modalism** or collapse the three into one subject.
   - Maintains that the church’s confession is “one essence in three persons,” not “one person in three persons.”
   - Urges precision and adherence to the historic terminology to avoid doctrinal error.
   "We must not say that God is one person, but that He is one being in three persons." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s careful articulation of the **Trinity** has shaped Reformed theology’s approach to divine unity and personal distinction. His critique of innovative language, such as Van Til’s “one person” formulation, underscores the importance of doctrinal precision and fidelity to the **historic confessions**. Bavinck’s work continues to serve as a standard for evaluating contemporary Trinitarian proposals, ensuring that the balance of unity and diversity remains central in orthodox theology.
