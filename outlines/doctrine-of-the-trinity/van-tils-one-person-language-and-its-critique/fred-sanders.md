# Fred Sanders (1968– )

Fred Sanders is a contemporary evangelical theologian known for his robust defense of **Nicene Trinitarianism** and his critique of **Cornelius Van Til’s “one person” language** regarding the Trinity. Sanders maintains that classical **Trinitarian doctrine** requires affirming God as one **being** in three **persons**, and he argues that Van Til’s formulation risks conflating the categories of person and being, thereby undermining the coherence of orthodox **Trinitarian distinctions**.

- "Van Til’s proposal that God is ‘one person’ as well as three persons is not a clarification of the doctrine of the Trinity, but a confusion of the categories of person and being." ("The Triune God," 2016)
