# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer critically engaged with **Cornelius Van Til’s** use of **one person language** in the doctrine of the **Trinity**, expressing concern that it risked undermining the classical distinction between **essence** and **person** within the Godhead. Berkouwer emphasized the importance of maintaining the traditional **Trinitarian** formulations to safeguard both the unity and the personal distinctions of the divine persons. He argued that Van Til’s approach, though motivated by a desire to uphold the unity of God, could introduce confusion regarding the nature of **personhood** in the Trinity.

- "The question is whether the use of the term ‘one person’ does not, in fact, obscure the confession of the three persons." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s critique of Van Til’s **one person language** has become a touchstone in discussions of modern Trinitarian theology, especially within the Reformed tradition. His insistence on classical distinctions and careful dogmatic language has influenced subsequent theologians concerned with preserving the integrity of the doctrine of the Trinity. Berkouwer’s work continues to be cited in debates over theological method and the boundaries of doctrinal innovation, reinforcing the importance of both **mystery** and clarity in articulating the Christian faith.
