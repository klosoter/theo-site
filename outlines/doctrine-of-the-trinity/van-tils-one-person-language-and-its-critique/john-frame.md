# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame has engaged deeply with **Cornelius Van Til’s doctrine of God**, particularly Van Til’s use of **one person language** to describe the **Trinity**. Frame affirms Van Til’s emphasis on the unity of God but critiques and clarifies the language to avoid confusion with **classical Trinitarian distinctions**. He seeks to maintain both the **ontological unity** and the **personal distinctions** within the Godhead, emphasizing clarity and fidelity to **Reformed orthodoxy**.

- "Van Til’s language about God as ‘one person’ is easily misunderstood and must be carefully qualified." 

## Key Works

- Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought (1995)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- John Frame’s Selected Shorter Writings, Vol. 1 (2014)
- Perspectives on the Doctrine of God: 4 Views (2008, contributor)
- "Van Til: The Theologian" in Westminster Theological Journal (1976)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of Trinitarian Orthodoxy**
    - Insists on the **one essence, three persons** formulation of the Trinity.
    - Warns against collapsing the **personal distinctions** within the Godhead.
    - Sees Van Til’s language as a call to emphasize unity, not to deny distinction.
    - Argues that any formulation must avoid **modalism** and **tritheism**.
    - "We must not allow the language of ‘one person’ to obscure the real distinctions among Father, Son, and Spirit." (Doctrine of God)

2. **Critical Appreciation of Van Til**
    - Recognizes Van Til’s intent to safeguard **divine unity**.
    - Appreciates Van Til’s apologetic emphasis on the **incomprehensibility of God**.
    - Notes the pedagogical value of Van Til’s formulations for **presuppositional apologetics**.
    - Critiques the lack of precision in Van Til’s use of “person.”
    - "Van Til’s terminology is provocative, but it requires careful explanation to avoid misunderstanding." (Analysis of His Thought)

3. **Clarification of ‘Person’ Language**
    - Argues that “person” should be reserved for the **Trinitarian distinctions**.
    - Suggests that calling God “one person” risks confusion with **Unitarianism**.
    - Proposes that “person” in Van Til’s sense means “personal,” not “a person.”
    - Emphasizes the need for **biblical and confessional precision**.
    - "It is better to say that God is personal, rather than that he is one person." (Doctrine of God)

4. **Commitment to Biblical Language**
    - Urges theologians to prioritize **Scriptural terminology**.
    - Warns against speculative or ambiguous philosophical terms.
    - Sees the **biblical witness** as the norm for theological language.
    - Advocates for language that communicates both **unity and diversity** in God.
    - "The Bible itself does not call God ‘one person’; we should be cautious in doing so." (Doctrine of God)

5. **Emphasis on Theological Clarity**
    - Stresses the importance of **clear definitions** in theology.
    - Seeks to avoid unnecessary controversy through precise language.
    - Encourages theologians to explain historical formulations for modern audiences.
    - Believes clarity serves the **church’s confession and witness**.
    - "Theological language must be both faithful to Scripture and clear to the church." (Selected Shorter Writings)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s critique of Van Til’s **one person language** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the doctrine of God, urging greater precision and faithfulness to **Trinitarian orthodoxy**. His work has influenced both academic and pastoral theology, helping clarify the boundaries of **Reformed confessionalism**. By engaging Van Til with both appreciation and critical analysis, Frame has contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between **divine unity** and **personal distinction** in the Trinity.
