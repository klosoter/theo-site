# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a central figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, approached the doctrine of the **Trinity** with a strong emphasis on the **distinction of persons** within the **unity of essence**. Hodge was critical of any formulation, such as **Van Til’s “one person” language**, that appeared to blur the classical distinction between **person** and **essence** in the Godhead, insisting that the three persons are truly distinct yet share the same divine substance.

- "The Church doctrine is, that there are three persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and that these three are the same in substance, equal in power and glory." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on the Trinity
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Classical Distinction of Persons and Essence**
    - Maintains that **God is one in essence** but three in person.
    - Rejects any language that conflates **person** and **essence**.
    - Argues that each person of the Trinity is distinct, not merely modes or manifestations.
    - Sees the **Nicene Creed** as the definitive articulation of this doctrine.
    - "The distinction between person and essence is not only scriptural, but necessary to the doctrine of the Trinity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Rejection of Modalism and Sabellianism**
    - Strongly opposes any view that reduces the persons to mere roles or appearances.
    - Warns that “one person” language risks collapsing the Trinity into **modalism**.
    - Emphasizes the eternal relations of origin: **generation** and **procession**.
    - Insists that the three persons are co-equal and co-eternal.
    - "If the persons are not truly distinct, then the doctrine of the Trinity is lost." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Scriptural Basis for Trinitarian Distinctions**
    - Grounds the doctrine in both Old and New Testament revelation.
    - Points to the baptismal formula and apostolic benediction as evidence.
    - Argues that the **Son** and **Spirit** are presented as distinct from the **Father**.
    - Maintains that biblical language must govern theological formulations.
    - "The Scriptures teach that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and yet that there is but one God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Analogy and Mystery in Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Affirms that the Trinity is ultimately a **mystery** beyond full human comprehension.
    - Uses analogies cautiously, warning against misleading or inadequate comparisons.
    - Stresses the importance of **theological precision** in language.
    - Critiques speculative or philosophical attempts to explain the Trinity.
    - "We must believe what God has revealed, though we cannot understand it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Theological Method: Exegetical and Confessional**
    - Prioritizes **exegesis** and the historic **Reformed confessions**.
    - Sees deviation from confessional language as theologically dangerous.
    - Upholds the **Westminster Confession**’s articulation of the Trinity.
    - Critiques innovations that lack grounding in Scripture and tradition.
    - "The safest course is to adhere to the language of Scripture and the Church." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **classical doctrine of the Trinity** shaped generations of Reformed theologians and set a standard for theological precision at Princeton Seminary. His critique of any “one person” language in reference to the Godhead has been influential in Reformed responses to later theological innovations, including those of **Cornelius Van Til**. Hodge’s insistence on the **distinction of persons** remains a touchstone in contemporary discussions of Trinitarian orthodoxy. His work continues to be a key resource for those seeking to uphold the historic, confessional understanding of the Trinity.
