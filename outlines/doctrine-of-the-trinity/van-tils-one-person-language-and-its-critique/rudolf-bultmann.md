# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **Christology** and the **doctrine of God** through the lens of existential interpretation, emphasizing the **kerygma** and the necessity of **demythologization**. He critiqued traditional metaphysical categories, insisting that authentic faith arises from the existential encounter with the **Revelation of God in Christ**, rather than from abstract doctrinal formulations such as "one person" language in Trinitarian theology.

- "We cannot use electric light and radio, and in the event of illness avail ourselves of modern medical and clinical means, and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Christian Doctrine**
    - Argues that biblical language is mythological and must be reinterpreted for modern understanding.
    - Sees traditional metaphysical categories (including "person") as culturally conditioned.
    - Emphasizes existential meaning over ontological formulations.
    - Critiques attempts to define the **Trinity** or **personhood** in abstract, philosophical terms.
    "The real question is not whether the New Testament conception of the person of Christ is mythological, but whether the kerygma itself is mythological." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter with Revelation**
    - Focuses on the individual's response to the **kerygma** rather than on metaphysical definitions.
    - Revelation is not propositional but eventful—God addresses the individual in the present.
    - The language of "person" is meaningful only as it relates to existential self-understanding.
    - Critiques static formulations of divine "personhood" as missing the dynamic nature of faith.
    "Faith is the abandonment of every attempt to justify oneself." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Critique of Metaphysical Language**
    - Traditional theological language (e.g., "one person," "three persons") is seen as inadequate for expressing existential truth.
    - Theological categories must be translated into terms accessible to modern existential experience.
    - Rejects the notion that doctrinal precision guarantees authentic faith.
    - Sees the risk of objectifying God through philosophical constructs.
    "Mythological thinking is objectifying thinking." (New Testament and Mythology)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is the heart of Christian faith, not doctrinal formulations.
    - The meaning of Christ’s person is found in the existential impact of the message, not in metaphysical explanation.
    - The church’s task is to interpret the **kerygma** for each generation.
    - Doctrinal debates about "person" language are secondary to the existential call of the gospel.
    "What matters is not the historical Jesus but the proclaimed Christ." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Historical Relativity of Doctrinal Language**
    - All doctrinal language is historically conditioned and must be continually reinterpreted.
    - The "one person" language reflects a particular historical context, not timeless truth.
    - Theological terms must be open to revision in light of contemporary understanding.
    - The enduring significance of doctrine lies in its existential relevance, not its metaphysical accuracy.
    "We cannot return to a pre-scientific world-view." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **demythologization** and existential interpretation has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in debates over the relevance of traditional doctrinal language. His critique of metaphysical formulations, such as "one person" language, challenges theologians to reconsider the function and meaning of **personhood** in Trinitarian theology. While controversial, Bultmann’s insistence on the existential encounter with the **kerygma** continues to shape discussions about the relationship between faith, doctrine, and modernity. His legacy endures in ongoing efforts to make Christian theology intelligible and meaningful in a post-metaphysical age.
