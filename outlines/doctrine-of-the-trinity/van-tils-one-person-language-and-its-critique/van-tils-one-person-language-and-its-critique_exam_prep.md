### TITLE
Is God One Person and Three? Van Til’s Analogical Personalism under Classical Trinitarian Scrutiny

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: Whether Cornelius Van Til’s claim that “God is one person and three persons” can be reconciled with classical trinitarian grammar of one essence and three hypostases while preserving **divine simplicity**, **analogical knowledge**, and covenantal personalism.
- Decisive figures: Cornelius Van Til, Thomas Aquinas, Herman Bavinck, John Frame, K. Scott Oliphint, James E. Dolezal.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic and medieval classical trinitarianism, Reformed orthodox theology proper, Dutch Neo-Calvinism, Van Tillian presuppositional apologetics, recent classical theist retrieval; external pressure from analytic social trinitarianism.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Interpretations of Van Til’s “one person” among Reformed and Van Tillians; coherence with **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations**; whether personalism risks a fourth hypostasis.
  - External: Social trinitarian accounts of “three centers of consciousness”; unitarian and Islamic critiques of trinitarian personhood; modern personalism and idealist “concrete universal.”
  - Contemporary: Analytic theology’s person-language, Oliphint’s covenantal properties and Dolezal’s critique, precision in catechesis and apologetics.
- Position: Defend Van Til’s intent as orthodox and valuable for grounding **personal** ultimacy, but reject the formula “God is one person” as terminologically defective; replace with “God is personal” within Nicene grammar of one **ousia** and three **hypostases**, guarding **subsistent relations**, **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, and **analogical knowledge**.

### ESSAY
The question whether Cornelius Van Til’s “one person” language belongs within the grammar of Nicene trinitarianism forces a meeting of dogmatic precision and apologetic motive. Van Til wished to drive a stake through the heart of every impersonal absolute, insisting that at the foundation of being there is not rational structure or sheer power but the covenant Lord who speaks, knows, and loves. To say, then, that “God is one person and three persons” functions for him as a systematic hinge: it stresses that divinity is not an abstract It but the living Lord, and that the ultimacy of unity and diversity is equally preserved only in the Trinity. Yet the phrase sits uneasily within the ecumenical rule that God is one essence and three hypostases, not one and four persons. What follows is an argument that Van Til’s intention is orthodox and important but that his precise formula should be abandoned in favor of classical expression: God is personal because the one essence subsists in three **persons**, with all divine action being the act of the tripersonal God by **inseparable operations**. This preserves his apologetic gains without the liabilities.

The classical grammar must be recalled with exactness before the claim can be judged. Thomas Aquinas codifies the patristic achievement by defining person in God as a subsistent relation of origin. The divine essence is numerically one, simple, and wholly identical with each of the three personal relations of Father, Son, and Spirit. The relations are really distinct as opposed by their origins, but these real distinctions do not divide the essence because each relation is identical to the essence according to **divine simplicity**. On this account, the essence is not a fourth hypostasis, and the category “person” is reserved for the subsistent relations, not for the essence as such. The upshot for language is stark: saying “God is one person” is a category mistake if “person” is used univocally with “hypostasis.” The oneness is the unity of essence; the threeness is the plurality of persons. By guarding the identity of essence and subsistent relations without collapse, Aquinas secures both the indivisible act of God and the genuine distinctions of Father, Son, and Spirit. This classical architecture underwrites **inseparable operations**, such that every external work of God is the work of the one simple God, though appropriately manifested and sometimes appropriated by a particular person according to the order of origin. The Fathers and medievals thereby give us the rule by which all later experiments in language must be measured.

Van Til’s background explains his departure in idiom without attributing to him doctrinal innovation in substance. Steeped in Old Princeton’s confessional orthodoxy and tutored by Dutch Neo-Calvinism, he internalized two crucial instincts: the Creator-creature distinction and the primacy of **analogical knowledge** of God. Against both rationalism and irrationalism, he locates human reason within God’s covenantal self-revelation in Scripture, denying all neutral territory. This epistemic stance flows into theology proper. Van Til insists that an impersonal absolute cannot account for the personal features of reality, and that the One-and-Many problem finds its metaphysical resolution in the triune life. The “concrete universal” he imputes to God is a way of refusing to abstract unity from plurality. The Trinity is ultimate personality, the archetype of personal communion and the source of covenant. Hence his formulation that “God is one person and three persons” functions polemically against deistic and pantheistic conceptions in which the ultimate either collapses diversity into unity or disintegrates unity into plurality. He draws here on Herman Bavinck’s claim that God is the absolute personality, the fullness of personal life, who alone grounds human personhood. Bavinck’s point was not that the essence is a fourth person but that personality belongs originally and archetypically to God rather than being imported from creation. In that sense, the one God is personal: he has mind, will, and affections; he speaks, acts, and pledges himself covenantally.

Yet Bavinck’s rhetoric is carefully constrained by classical grammar. He both deploys and safeguards **divine simplicity**, **autotheos**, and **inseparable operations**. He explicates the personal language biblically and dogmatically: Scripture addresses God in the singular and the plural without confusion, and the one Lord of Israel is the triune Lord who reveals himself in the economy. Bavinck uses the term “personal” predicated of the divine being to counter the notion that “Godhead” is a bare essence, but he consistently refuses to turn that into a fourth hypostasis. Under Bavinck’s influence, Van Til’s aim is laudable; his idiom, however, risks miscommunication because it shifts the sense of “person” within a single sentence. He means by “one person” that the one God is personal, and by “three persons” that the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct subsistents. The phrase requires an implicit semantic shift from “personal” to “hypostasis,” and it is precisely the implicitness that provokes critique.

John Frame, a sympathetic interpreter, proposes the most charitable and widely received corrective. For Frame, Van Til’s formula is acceptable only if “one person” is taken to mean “personal” and “three persons” to retain conciliar force. Within his tri-perspectival method, God’s lordship attributes of control, authority, and presence express a single covenant Lord who engages us personally. The three persons each fully possess the divine attributes, and all divine actions are executed by the tripersonal God. Framed this way, the formula is not heretical but rhetorically hazardous. Frame’s adjustment tracks the classical rule: reserve “person” for hypostasis, but do not hesitate to assert that God is personal in the strongest sense. Some examiners will press whether this is mere patching after the fact. The answer is that the patch is demanded by the conciliar grammar itself, and that theology has always balanced biblically necessary assertions about God’s personal agency with metaphysical precision about what constitutes personhood in God. Frame’s reinterpretation stays within those rails.

K. Scott Oliphint sought to extend Van Til’s emphasis on covenantal personalism through a proposal about “covenantal properties,” according to which God freely assumes new relations and properties in condescension that are not intrinsic to his essential nature. His goal was to protect both **divine simplicity** and biblical depictions of God’s responsive actions. He defends Van Til’s intent by pushing hard on the Creator-creature distinction and the freedom of God to take to himself, ad extra, ways of being toward the world that do not compromise his essential life. The Achilles heel of this project, as James Dolezal has argued, is that the grammar of taking on “properties” suggests composition and contingency in God if not carefully delimited. Dolezal’s **classical theism** retrieval insists that ad extra relational descriptions do not require new properties in God but new relations of reason grounded in God’s immutable decree and temporal effects in creation. On this account, it is pastorally better to speak of God being personal toward us by eternal, simple act, expressing itself diversely in time, than to speak of God acquiring covenantal properties. The critique lands with special force on Van Til’s “one person” phrase: if the essence is called a person, even analogically, is this not a genuine fourth? The classical reply is ready to hand. Analogical predication is bound by conciliar lineaments, not a license to reset categories. It is one thing to say God is personal to secure that the living God is not an It, the other to call the essence a person. The former is a long-recognized and safe claim, the latter requires endless qualification and should be avoided.

At this juncture Thomas Aquinas must be engaged with care, because he uniquely clarifies why the one God can be called personal without collapsing into a fourth hypostasis. In his mature account of the Trinity, personhood in God is subsistent relation grounded in origin: paternity, filiation, and spiration. There is one, simple act of being and knowing and willing in God, identical with the essence. Because God is absolutely simple, there is no real distinction of nature and supposit in him; the persons are not parts that compose the divine. Each person is the whole simple God subsisting as a distinct relation of origin. From this, two consequences flow for language. First, person terms belong properly to Father, Son, and Spirit; second, it is nevertheless right to speak of God as personal inasmuch as the operations of intellect and will are identical with the divine essence and are not impersonal capacities. The personal life is not an accident the Trinity happens to have; it is the very being of God as the subsisting act of understanding and loving. This allows us to say that the one God is personal without implying a fourth person. It also secures **inseparable operations**, such that the one God’s every external act is triune. When Van Til insists that the one God is personal, he stands on classical ground. When he compresses that into “one person,” he blurs Aquinas’s careful person-essence distinction that preserves both unity and threeness.

Van Til’s supporters often appeal to **analogical knowledge** to rescue the phrase: if all language about God is analogical, then “person” in “one person” can be analogical in a different sense than “person” in “three persons.” But the analogical nature of theological language is not a warrant to equivocate within a single predication in a way that contradicts conciliar usage. The point of the doctrine of analogy is to sanctify creaturely speech to true predication of God without usurping divine simplicity or collapsing Creator into creature. It is not permission to float meanings unmoored from doctrinal grammar. An examiner might press: Does not Scripture itself speak of God with singular pronouns and call him “He” who is the Lord, thus implying one person? Here **inseparable operations** and appropriation do their work. The Lord who says “I” is the triune Lord, though in the economy the Father speaks of the Son, the Son prays to the Father, and the Spirit is sent by the Father and the Son. The singular pronoun confesses the unity of the divine speaker, not necessarily the collapse of the persons into a single hypostasis. The Old Testament’s singular “I am the Lord” and the New Testament’s single name into which we are baptized cohere not because there is a fourth person, but because the consubstantial persons share the one essence and act inseparably. To preserve that exegetical and dogmatic clarity, the safe predicate is “God is personal,” not “God is one person.”

This brings us back to Van Til’s principal apologetic burden. He wanted to demonstrate that only the tripersonal God uniquely furnishes the conditions of intelligibility, including the existence of personal agents and communities. The equal ultimacy of the one and the many, as he would say, is not a compromise but an archetype in the Trinity. External critics from analytic social trinitarianism agree on the centrality of personhood but propose a different ontology: three centers of consciousness in a collective unity. For them, the guardrails of **divine simplicity** and subsistent relations seem metaphysically extravagant or unintelligible. They prefer to model the Trinity on a quasi-corporate unity, invoking three “whos” with one “what,” typically emphasizing robust psychological independence and the will as individuating. Van Til’s exact phrase does not help here. It is too easy for a social trinitarian to treat it as evidence of confusion within classical theism and to substitute a univocal personal ontology imported from creaturely psychology. The better apologetic is classical: the divine persons are not centers of consciousness in the creaturely sense, but subsistent relations, each the whole simple God, with one will and one intellect. The triune God is personal not because of three separate psychological centers, but because the act of understanding and loving is subsistent and identical with the essence in each person. This is a deeper, not a thinner, personalism.

Internally, Reformed theologians have long insisted on **autotheos** of the Son and the Spirit in the sense of their sharing the whole divine essence, even as they are eternally from the Father according to personal origin. Van Til’s personalism sought to safeguard such coequality by resisting any hint of subordination or impersonal abstraction. Hermeneutically, the doctrine of **analogical knowledge** was supposed to prevent the univocal importation of creaturely categories of person into theology proper. The irony is that the “one person” idiom instead risks a univocal move in the other direction, importing hypostatic person language into the essence. The best of Van Til needs the best of Aquinas here. It is precisely **divine simplicity**, deployed to interpret biblical revelation and dogmatic tradition, that validates Van Til’s rejection of abstract deity and deistic monism, while forbidding his incautious locution.

What, then, should we defend at examination? First, that Van Til’s intent is orthodox. He carried forward Bavinck’s insistence that only if God is the living Lord can history, knowledge, and ethics be covenantally grounded. He championed **analogical knowledge**, the Creator-creature distinction, and Scripture’s authority in theology proper. He did not deny the three hypostases. His “one person” phrase presupposes, rather than abandons, the Nicene rule. Second, that his exact phrase should be dropped in teaching and apologetics. It imposes a needless burden of explanation, invites misunderstanding with modalism or a fourth hypostasis, and fails to honor the hard-won conciliar precision regarding **ousia** and **hypostasis**. The right replacement is the classical assertion that the one God is personal, because the one essence subsists as Father, Son, and Spirit, and all divine action is of the tripersonal God by **inseparable operations**. Third, that we can retain Van Til’s apologetic insight without his wording: the Trinity alone grounds the equal ultimacy of unity and plurality, the possibility of knowledge and communication, and the reality of moral obligation under the **federal theology** of covenant. The triune God’s personal ultimacy secures revelation and redemption without conceding the metaphysical ground to modern personalism or social trinitarianism.

Anticipating objections clarifies the stakes. Does this position capitulate to scholasticism at the expense of Scripture? No. The classical grammar was forged to safeguard Scriptural teaching. The notion of **subsistent relations** extracts rather than imposes meaning from biblical revelation about Father, Son, and Spirit in creation, redemption, and Pentecost. Is not “personal” too weak to sustain covenantal relationality? No. Calling God “personal” in the classical sense confesses that intellect and will in God are subsistent act, not faculties; there is nothing more personal than identifying being itself as living knowing and loving. Does this dilute Van Til’s polemic against impersonal absolutes? No. It strengthens it by grounding personal ultimacy in **divine simplicity** rather than in a rhetorical flourish that risks modalist misunderstanding. Finally, does this make apologetics harder in interfaith contexts, where the opponent presses the singular personal pronouns of Scripture and Islamic monotheism? No. It equips the defender to say with precision that the one Lord who says “I” in Scripture is the triune Lord whose persons speak and act inseparably yet distinctly in the economy. When the Son says “I,” he speaks as the Son to the Father; when the one Lord speaks, it is not as a non-triadic essence but as the triune God, the same Lord whose name is Father, Son, and Spirit.

The decisive figures sharpen these judgments. Van Til’s genius was to tie theology proper to epistemology through **analogical knowledge** and the antithesis, thereby refusing to cede personhood to the creature as an autonomous datum. His “concrete universal” insists that unity and plurality are not competitive, and in this he is right. Aquinas gives us the metaphysical grammar to say how the one God is personal without being a fourth person: **divine simplicity**, **subsistent relations**, and **inseparable operations**. Bavinck, straddling scholastic precision and devotional warmth, presses that God is the absolute personality who gives rather than borrows personal life, while carefully refusing to personify the essence as a fourth. Frame articulates a prudent reading that preserves Van Til’s intent while cleaning up his locution. Oliphint’s covenantal properties attempt to rescue covenantal personalism runs afoul of a classical critique represented by Dolezal, who presses for a God whose ad extra relationality is the expression of simple, immutable act rather than a layering of properties. Taken together, these figures point to the same conclusion: the Trinity is the ground of all personal reality and covenantal history, and because this is so, the language that teaches the Trinity must stay within the conciliar pattern. To say “God is one person and three persons” obliges so many clarifications that it ceases to perform the work it was meant to do. To say “God is personal” while confessing one **ousia** and three **hypostases** does the dogmatic and apologetic work with clarity.

The positive payoff is broad. In theology proper, we maintain the identity of the one essence and three persons, safeguarding **inseparable operations** and prosopological exegesis of Scripture. In Christology, we keep the line between the person of the Son and the divine essence clear, avoiding confusion in incarnation talk. In pneumatology, we confess the Spirit as person, not a force, without sliding into tripartition of divine willing. In ecclesiology and **federal theology**, we ground covenantal administration in a Lord who is personal not by participation in a higher category but by being himself the source of all personal being. In apologetics, we maintain the claim that without the triune Lord, there is no intelligibility, without using language that our opponents can too easily misconstrue into a contradiction. In spirituality, we pray to the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit, confident that our triune God is personally near, because he is personally the Lord.

The examiner’s final challenge might be short and sharp: Did Van Til err? The measured answer is yes in his wording, no in his doctrine. He erred by using “person” in two senses within one predication in a way that obscures the conciliar distinction of **ousia** and **hypostasis**. But his doctrinal intent belongs to the very heart of Christian confession: the one God is the living Lord, the triune Lord, whose personal ultimacy is the condition of creation, redemption, and knowledge. The right way forward for Westminster candidates is to receive his insight under the discipline of classical trinitarian grammar. Let God be confessed as personal, not as a fourth person; let the Trinity be confessed as three **persons** in one essence, with **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations** as guardrails; let **analogical knowledge** order our talk so that it is true without presumption. This path defends both the glory of the triune God and the coherence of the confession entrusted to us.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Van Til’s “one person” asserts divine personal ultimacy, but within classical trinitarianism we must say the one **ousia** is personal because it subsists in three **hypostases**, not that the essence is a fourth person; preserve **divine simplicity**, **subsistent relations**, and **inseparable operations** under **analogical knowledge**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Cornelius Van Til: pressed personal ultimacy and equal ultimacy of one and many; used “one person and three persons” to oppose impersonal absolutes.
  - Thomas Aquinas: secured person as subsistent relation, forbidding a fourth hypostasis; anchor for **divine simplicity** and classical grammar.
  - Herman Bavinck: “absolute personality” of God while carefully avoiding personifying the essence; influenced Van Til.
  - John Frame: rehabilitates Van Til as “God is personal” in one sense, three persons in another; urges terminological precision.
  - K. Scott Oliphint: covenantal properties to guard divine personalism in history; criticized for endangering simplicity.
  - James E. Dolezal: classical theist retrieval; rejects essence-as-person talk and covenantal properties as compromising simplicity.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Whether Van Til’s language is orthodox with qualification; Frame’s reinterpretation vs Oliphint’s expansion; classical retrieval’s cautions about simplicity and person-language.
  - External: Social trinitarian models of three centers of consciousness; unitarian and Islamic critiques of triune personhood; idealist “concrete universal.”
  - Contemporary: Analytic precision in person-language, catechetical clarity, and apologetic effectiveness without modalist overtones.
- Defended position: Affirm Van Til’s intent but drop the formula; teach that God is personal, not a person, within Nicene grammar, thus retaining his apologetic force while protecting **divine simplicity** and trinitarian clarity.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does “one person” violate Nicene categories? Yes terminologically; the safe alternative is “God is personal.”
  - How does simplicity relate to personhood? Persons are **subsistent relations** identical with the simple essence.
  - Do singular biblical pronouns imply a fourth person? No; they confess the one Lord who is triune, with **inseparable operations** and appropriations.
  - Can analogical predication rescue Van Til’s phrase? Not as stated; analogy cannot transgress conciliar usage within one predication.
  - What is the apologetic payoff without “one person”? The triune God still uniquely grounds personal reality and intelligibility; clarity strengthens, not weakens, the case.
