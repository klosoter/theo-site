### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether Cornelius Van Til’s claim that God is “one person” can be reconciled with Nicene and Reformed **Trinitarian orthodoxy**, given the confession of “three persons in one God.”
- Decisive figures: Cornelius Van Til, B. B. Warfield, Herman Bavinck, John Frame, Scott Oliphint.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed scholastic **doctrine of God** and Trinity, Dutch neo-Calvinism, confessional Presbyterianism, and twentieth‑century Reformed apologetics.
- Debates: Internal Reformed disagreements over Van Til’s language and method; external pressure from classical Thomist and analytic trinitarian critiques; contemporary debates on **classical theism**, **social trinitarianism**, and Reformed catholicity.
- Defended position: Van Til’s “one person” language is formally compatible with Nicene and Reformed trinitarianism only when strictly constrained as a nontechnical, analogical designation of the one God as the living, self‑conscious covenant Lord, with the technical doctrine of three hypostases unambiguously preserved and prioritized.

### ESSAY
Cornelius Van Til’s language that God is “one person” has become a test case for the relation between Reformed apologetics and classical **Trinitarian orthodoxy**. Examiners will press whether this formula is a stroke of theological genius that freshly underscores God’s absolute self‑consciousness and covenant personality, or a dangerous confusion of the Nicene grammar of “one essence in three persons.” The task is to show that Van Til’s aim and controlling commitments remain within orthodox bounds, while his terminology is at best analogical and pastoral, and at worst misleading if abstracted from his broader **Creator–creature distinction** and his explicit affirmation of three distinct persons.

To situate Van Til, we must begin not with him, but with the classical and Reformed background he both received and radicalized. Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield, as one of Van Til’s most formative influences at Princeton, exemplified an exacting orthodoxy on the Trinity. In his classic essay “The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity,” Warfield argues that Scripture presents a God who is numerically one in **essence** and three in **person**, with the New Testament disclosing a fully developed trinitarianism already implicit in the Old. Warfield carefully guards the metaphysical grammar bequeathed by Nicaea and Constantinople: the one ousia, three hypostases structure. For Warfield, the term “person” in the Trinity is sui generis and not simply identical with human personality, though he is willing to exploit the category of **personal** God over against deistic or pantheistic conceptions. Warfield’s writings show no inclination to call God “one person” in a technical sense. His precision becomes the foil against which Van Til’s compressed formulations stand out.

If Warfield supplied the confessional and exegetical rigor, Herman Bavinck provided the richly integrated dogmatic context Van Til consciously absorbed. Bavinck’s Reformed Dogmatics is pervasively concerned to hold together the doctrines of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and the ontological Trinity with the living, self‑revealing, personal God of Scripture. For Bavinck, God is the absolute “I,” the infinite, living subject, the fullness of personal life in himself. Yet Bavinck insists that strictly speaking God’s personal being is triune: the one simple essence subsists in three **self‑conscious hypostases**. He plays heavily on the idea that in God there is the highest form of **personal** existence, but he consistently reserves “person” as the technical label for Father, Son, and Spirit. His strategy is clear: to enrich the concept of divine personality without collapsing the one‑three grammar that distinguishes Christian theism from all rivals.

Van Til inherits from Warfield and Bavinck a robust commitment to classical doctrine of God and an acute sense of the competing alternatives in modern thought. Trained at Princeton under Warfield’s successors, steeped in Bavinck and Kuyper, Van Til’s fundamental burden in his apologetic and prolegomena is to oppose every form of **autonomous reason** and defend the ontological Trinity as the precondition of human knowledge, morality, and being. In The Defense of the Faith and An Introduction to Systematic Theology, he repeatedly insists that Christian theism stands or falls with the confession that reality is ultimately personal and not impersonally rational or irrationally chaotic. Against idealism and personalism, he argues that only the triune God can ground the unity and diversity of the world and of human experience.

It is in this polemical context that Van Til introduces his notorious “one person” language. He wants to say that God is not a bare essence, not an abstract absolute, but the living, self‑conscious, covenant Lord who speaks, wills, and relates. To stress this, he declares that “God is one person” and that we must avoid the idea of an impersonal essence behind the three persons. At the same time, he explicitly affirms that God is “three persons in one being” and that there are three “distinct persons” in the Trinity. His one‑person language appears not as a systematic replacement for the confessional formula but as a counter‑thrust against any tendency to conceive the divine nature as a common substance shared by three independently personal centers in a way that would threaten **divine simplicity** or the unity of the divine mind and will.

Examiners will immediately press the first objection: Is Van Til not simply contradicting the creeds which say one essence, three persons? How can God be one person and three persons without either equivocation or outright confusion? Here Bavinck’s and Warfield’s formulations provide the necessary control. When Van Til says “one person,” he is not proposing a new fourth hypostasis, nor replacing the term essence with person in the Nicene formula. Rather, he is using “person” once in a broader, analogical sense and once in the narrower, technical sense. In the broader sense, “person” designates that God is the living, self‑aware subject of all his own attributes, the covenant “I am” who knows and loves himself perfectly. In the narrower, technical sense, “person” designates the three distinct modes of subsistence in the one simple divine essence, each truly “I” over against the others and yet the one God. The key is that Van Til never denies the three persons; he simply refuses to let the divine essence be conceived as an impersonal substratum beneath them.

Nonetheless, the internal Reformed debate has exposed genuine problems in Van Til’s language and its reception. John Frame, one of Van Til’s most prominent students and interpreters, has devoted substantial effort to both defending and refining his teacher’s position. In his Doctrine of God and various essays on the Trinity and apologetics, Frame emphasizes that Van Til was unequivocally committed to Nicene and Westminster orthodoxy. Frame explains Van Til’s “one person” language as an attempt to preserve the equal ultimacy of unity and diversity in God: God is both one and three, and one must not subordinate the one to the three or the three to the one. For Frame, the “one person” is a way of saying that the one God is personal, not an abstraction, and that the three persons are not three centers of consciousness who share a fourth overarching impersonal essence.

At the same time, Frame does not advocate adopting “one person” as a standard formula. He acknowledges that it is confusing, since in historic dogmatics “person” is the term reserved for the hypostases. Frame’s mediating move is to distinguish between different senses of “person” and to urge that the technical, conciliar sense must govern dogmatic statements, while recognizing that preachers and apologists, including Van Til, sometimes use the term in a looser sense. Yet Frame presses a deeper observation that helps rehabilitate Van Til’s impulse: the Reformed tradition, from Calvin through Bavinck, has often used the language of God as the supreme “person” or as “personal” reality to counteract deism and pantheism. What is unique in Van Til is not the attribution of personality to the one God, but the compression of that tradition into the formula “God is one person,” without the usual clarifications.

K. Scott Oliphint, another leading Van Tilian, represents a second internal trajectory. In God with Us and his writings on the incomprehensibility and accommodation of God, Oliphint highlights Van Til’s deep commitment to the **Creator–creature distinction** and to **analogical knowledge**. He argues that Van Til’s language must be read within his insistence that all our concepts of God are analogical and that no human term can be applied to God univocally. Therefore, when Van Til uses “person” of God, he is not simply importing the human concept of a finite center of consciousness into the divine; he is indicating an analogical perfection that belongs first to God and only then to us by participation. Oliphint thus turns Van Til’s one‑person formula into a case study in Reformed epistemology and theological methodology: if all our predication of God is analogical, we cannot object to Van Til for using “person” analogically of the one God, provided he maintains the orthodox distinction of the three hypostases.

Yet critics, both internal and external, charge that this defense fails to remove the core difficulty: classical dogmatic usage reserved “person” for the hypostases precisely to safeguard the Nicene grammar, and Van Til’s innovation risks confusion in catechesis and polemics. From within the Reformed scholastic stream, concern has been raised that Van Til’s formulation tends toward a kind of monopsychism in God: one personal subject who somehow is also three personal subjects, undermining the real distinction of the persons. Here Warfield’s and Bavinck’s precision on **subsistence**, **relations of origin**, and the single divine intellect and will becomes vital. The classic formulations maintain that the persons are really distinct as Father, Son, and Spirit by their eternal relations, yet they share numerically one simple intellect and will. There is, in that sense, one divine “mind” and “will,” but not one person instead of three. The question is whether Van Til accidentally obscures this pattern by his rhetoric.

The best way to answer that charge is to insist on a disciplined theological grammar. My defended position is that Van Til’s “one person” language is formally compatible with Reformed orthodoxy only if it is strictly restricted to a nontechnical, analogical usage and subordinated to the Nicene and confessional formula as the regulating norm. In formal dogmatic assertions, we must say: God is one in **essence**, three in **person**. Within that framework, it is legitimate to say that the one God is personal, or even that he is the archetypal person, as long as we immediately clarify that this is not an additional person above the three but the one triune God considered as the living Lord. When Van Til’s statements are nested in this grammar, they become an intensification of the classical intuition that God is personal in the highest sense, rather than a revision of the creedal structure.

External critiques, particularly from Thomistic and analytic trinitarian quarters, press a different set of concerns. From a Thomist perspective, any talk of God as “one person” risks blurring the metaphysical distinction between nature and person that undergirds both Trinitarian and Christological dogma. Thomas Aquinas insists that in God there is one simple essence and three subsistent relations, and that “person” properly names a distinct subsistent. To call the essence itself “a person” seems to introduce a fourth subsistent reality or to redefine “person” away from its technical meaning. Moreover, Thomists often worry that Van Til’s polemic against “abstract essences” underestimates the way in which classical metaphysics already accounts for God as pure act, ipsum esse subsistens, in whom there is no composition of essence and existence, and therefore no impersonal substratum.

Analytic trinitarians, on the other hand, have sometimes heard in Van Til’s language an opening to “Latin social trinitarianism,” as if God were one personal subject who somehow contains three internal self‑conscious perspectives. This would move away from the classical model toward modern social models that treat the persons as three centers of consciousness who cooperate as a moral community. Van Til himself repudiates any suggestion that the three persons are three parts of God or three beings; he is a thoroughgoing **classical theist**. But his appropriation by later writers sometimes overlaps with contemporary interest in divine personhood, raising the danger of reading him through a social trinitarian lens that he neither intended nor supplied.

Here Bavinck is again decisive as a corrective. He insists that God’s personal life is not a fourth layer above the three persons but precisely the triune life itself. To say that God is the absolute personality is to say that in the triune communion of Father, Son, and Spirit, the fullness of what we mean by personal subjectivity is realized in a way wholly analogical to, and archetypal of, our finite personality. There is no personal essence behind the persons; the divine essence simply is the three persons in their mutual relations. This Bavinckian principle should govern the reading of Van Til. When he rejects the idea of an impersonal essence, he stands with Bavinck. When he says God is one person, his only defensible meaning is that the divine essence is not impersonal, but is the triune Lord himself in his living self‑consciousness.

The contemporary debate about **Reformed catholicity** and ressourcement has sharpened these concerns. Many within conservative Presbyterian circles have urged a retrieval of classical trinitarian metaphysics, including **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, and the careful terminology of person and essence. In this context, Van Til’s compressed formulas have been scrutinized as potential liabilities for confessional clarity. The task is to hold fast to Van Til’s deep insights on the ontological Trinity as the basis of all predication and the necessity of **analogical knowledge**, while re‑expressing those insights in a way that clearly aligns with the ecumenical creeds and Reformed confessions.

This has implications across adjacent loci. In **Christology**, the distinction between nature and person is central: the eternal person of the Son assumes a human nature. If the divine nature itself is described as “one person” without qualification, confusion could spill into the doctrine of Christ’s two natures in one person, as if the divine nature were itself a person that unites with the human nature. Careful grammar thus requires preserving the classical identifications: the person in Christ is the divine hypostasis of the Son; the nature he assumes is truly human; the divine nature is not a distinct person but the shared essence of the Trinity. Any extension of “person” language to the divine essence must be explicitly marked as analogical and nontechnical.

Similarly, in **prolegomena** and **epistemology**, Van Til’s “one person” formula aims to underwrite a profoundly **personalist** account of revelation and knowledge. Because God is the living covenant Lord, all human knowledge is a response to his personal speech; there is no neutral, impersonal fact. Here Van Til’s rhetoric rightly guards against deistic and rationalist tendencies. Examiners may ask whether his polemic can be preserved without his controversial language. The answer is yes: one can say that the one God is personal, that he is the triune Lord who speaks, that he is the living subject of all truth, without formally stating that he is “one person” in addition to being three. The apologetic payoff comes from emphasizing the personal character of revelation, not from altering the basic dogmatic formula.

My defended position, then, is twofold. First, Van Til’s substantive theology of the Trinity, when interpreted in light of Warfield and Bavinck and clarified by Frame and Oliphint, remains within the bounds of Nicene and Reformed orthodoxy. He affirms one simple divine essence, three distinct persons, and maintains the full deity and distinction of Father, Son, and Spirit. Second, his “one person” formulation is, in itself, an unfortunate and confusing way of expressing a legitimate concern. It can and should be retained only as a carefully qualified, analogical expression, never allowed to stand as a bare formula, and always subordinated to the classical grammar of one essence and three persons. To that extent, a constructive Reformed theology today will affirm Van Til’s core insights while revising his terminology for the sake of clarity and catholicity.

An examiner might object that this amounts to “saving” Van Til by reinterpretation, and that his words should be taken at face value. The answer is that no theologian, especially one writing primarily in the idiom of apologetics and teaching notes rather than in a formal dogmatic treatise, should be frozen at the level of slogans. Van Til himself insisted that all theology must be read contextually, under the authority of Scripture and confession. Reading him charitably through Bavinck and Warfield is not special pleading but an exercise in Reformed hermeneutics of tradition. At the same time, this charitable reading does not sanctify his phraseology; it allows us to say that while his intention was orthodox, his expression is best handled with caution.

The upshot for oral defense is this. One should neither canonize nor anathematize the “one person” formula. Instead, one should demonstrate mastery of the classical distinction of essence and person, the Reformed development of divine personality and **analogical knowledge**, the internal Van Tilian debates as represented by Frame and Oliphint, and the external critiques from Thomism and analytic trinitarianism. One should then argue that Van Til’s underlying insight is indispensable: the Christian God is not an abstract absolute but the triune, self‑conscious, covenant Lord, whose triune life is the archetype of all personal being and knowing. That insight can be and should be retained, while our doctrinal grammar remains governed by the Nicene and Reformed norms of “one essence, three persons,” rather than the ambiguous and easily misunderstood slogan that God is “one person.” Within those constraints, Van Til’s contribution can strengthen, rather than destabilize, Reformed **Trinitarian orthodoxy**.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Van Til’s “one person” language is a compressed, analogical way of saying that the one triune God is the living, self‑conscious covenant Lord, not an impersonal essence, and is only orthodox when subordinated to the classical formula of one **essence** in three **persons**.
- Decisive figures and stance: Warfield supplies precise Nicene grammar and refuses to call the essence “a person”; Bavinck insists God is absolute personality but reserves “person” technically for the hypostases; Van Til innovatively says God is “one person” to combat abstract theism; Frame defends Van Til’s intent but recommends limiting his terminology; Oliphint reads Van Til’s usage through **analogical knowledge** and the **Creator–creature distinction**.
- Internal debates: Reformed concerns over whether “one person” obscures the real distinction of the three persons and the nature–person distinction in Trinitarianism and Christology; Van Tilian defenders argue it is nontechnical, analogical, and contextually safe.
- External debates: Thomist critique that calling the essence “a person” confuses metaphysical categories; analytic trinitarian worry that Van Til’s formula invites quasi‑social or monopsychic models inconsistent with classical **divine simplicity** and one mind–three persons grammar.
- Contemporary debates: Reformed catholicity and retrieval of classical theism press for more precise trinitarian language; broader interest in divine personhood and social trinitarianism heightens the stakes around Van Til’s rhetoric.
- Defended position: Van Til’s underlying theology is orthodox and valuable, but his “one person” language must be explicitly treated as analogical and nontechnical, and should not supplant the confessional one‑essence‑three‑persons formula.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - Does Van Til’s “one person” contradict Nicene trinitarianism? Only if taken as a technical formula; read analogically and subordinated to “one essence, three persons,” it need not.
  - How does Bavinck help correct or contextualize Van Til? Bavinck shows that God is absolute personality precisely as triune, ruling out a fourth personal layer behind the three.
  - Why is the nature–person distinction crucial here? Because calling the divine nature “a person” without qualification risks confusion in both Trinity and Christology.
  - Can we keep Van Til’s apologetic insight without his formula? Yes, by strongly affirming that the one God is personal and triune, while retaining classical trinitarian grammar.
