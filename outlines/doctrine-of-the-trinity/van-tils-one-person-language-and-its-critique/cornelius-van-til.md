# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til’s use of **one person language** in reference to the **Trinity** sought to safeguard the unity of God while maintaining the full **ontological equality** of the three persons. He argued that the **absolute personality of God** is not a mere abstraction, but that the Godhead is both one and three in a way that transcends human categories. Van Til’s formulation has been critiqued for potentially blurring the distinction between the persons, yet he insisted that his approach was necessary to uphold the **biblical doctrine of God** against both **Unitarianism** and **tritheism**.

- "Christian Theistic Ethics"
- John Frame, "Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought"
- Scott Oliphint, "The Consistency of Van Til’s Methodology: One Person and Three Persons"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Unity and Personality Are Inseparable**
    - Van Til insists that the **unity of God** is not impersonal but is itself fully personal.
    - He rejects any notion of an abstract divine essence behind the persons.
    - The **one person language** is meant to affirm that the Godhead is not a committee of three individuals.
    - This unity is not at the expense of the real distinctions among the persons.
    - "We must maintain that God is a concrete universal, that is, that he is both one and many equally." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology", p. 220)

2. **Rejection of Unitarian and Tritheistic Tendencies**
    - Van Til’s formulation is a response to the dangers of both **Unitarianism** (denying the Trinity) and **tritheism** (dividing the Godhead).
    - He argues that traditional formulations often leave room for misunderstanding the unity or the diversity.
    - The one person language is intended to close the door to both errors.
    - He maintains that only the **Christian doctrine of the Trinity** provides a coherent account of unity and diversity.
    - "If we refuse to speak of God as one person, we are driven to tritheism; if we refuse to speak of God as three persons, we are driven to Unitarianism." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology", p. 221)

3. **Analogical Knowledge and Mystery**
    - Van Til emphasizes that our knowledge of God is always **analogical**, not univocal.
    - The mystery of the Trinity means that human language will always be inadequate.
    - The use of one person language is a **theological analogy**, not a literal description.
    - He warns against rationalistic attempts to resolve the mystery of the Trinity.
    - "We must not pretend to be able to comprehend fully how God can be both one and three." ("The Defense of the Faith", p. 14)

4. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Language**
    - Van Til grounds his doctrine in the **biblical revelation** of God as both one and three.
    - He insists that all theological language must be subordinate to Scripture.
    - The one person language is his attempt to be faithful to the biblical witness.
    - He sees the **Trinity** as the only foundation for true personality and community.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a product of speculative philosophy but of biblical revelation." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology", p. 218)

5. **Critique and Clarification of Traditional Formulations**
    - Van Til acknowledges that his language is controversial and open to misunderstanding.
    - He clarifies that he does not mean to deny the traditional distinction of persons.
    - His aim is to highlight the **absolute personality** of the triune God.
    - He invites further theological reflection to avoid both modalism and tritheism.
    - "If I were asked whether I believe in one person or three persons in the Godhead, I would say I believe in both." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology", p. 221)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s **one person language** has sparked significant debate within Reformed and evangelical theology, with critics warning of potential confusion regarding the distinctions within the Trinity. Nevertheless, his emphasis on the **absolute personality of God** and the analogical nature of theological language has influenced later theologians seeking to articulate the mystery of the Trinity. Van Til’s approach continues to provoke discussion about the limits and possibilities of human language in expressing the biblical doctrine of God. His work remains a touchstone for those engaging the relationship between **unity and diversity** in the doctrine of the Trinity.
