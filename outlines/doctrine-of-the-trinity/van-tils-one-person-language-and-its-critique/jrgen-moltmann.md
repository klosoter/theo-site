# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann’s doctrine of **personhood in the Trinity** centers on the **relationality** and **mutual indwelling** of the divine persons, advocating a robust **social trinitarianism**. He critiques any approach that collapses the **threeness** of the Trinity into a singular, undifferentiated subject, insisting on the importance of both unity and distinction within the Godhead.

- "The unity of the triune God is to be found in the perichoresis of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, not in the general concept of the divine substance." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Key Works

- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1981)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- History and the Triune God (1991)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- "God in the World? The Trinity Reconsidered" (in Dialog, 1981)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Relational Personhood in the Trinity**
    - Each divine person exists in and through relationship with the others.
    - Rejects any notion of the Trinity as a solitary, undifferentiated subject.
    - Asserts that **perichoresis** (mutual indwelling) is the true ground of divine unity.
    - The persons are co-equal and mutually constitutive, not subordinate.
    - "God is not a solitary, absolute subject, but a community of love." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

2. **Critique of Monopersonal Language**
    - Describing God as "one person" risks modalism or unitarianism.
    - The biblical witness affirms three distinct persons, not merely modes or manifestations.
    - Van Til’s language is seen as insufficiently trinitarian and suppressing the richness of divine life.
    - Advocates for language that does justice to both unity and diversity in God.
    - "The formula ‘one person’ for God is not only unbiblical but also theologically misleading." (Experiences in Theology)

3. **Social Trinitarianism**
    - The Trinity is a model for human community and social relations.
    - Divine unity is a unity of love and communion, not of abstract essence.
    - The Trinity is the foundation for understanding freedom and equality.
    - Critiques Western tradition for prioritizing substance over relationality.
    - "The social doctrine of the Trinity overcomes the rigid monotheism of substance." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **Perichoresis as Unity**
    - The unity of God is constituted by the mutual indwelling of the persons.
    - Rejects metaphysical unity as the primary category for understanding God.
    - Emphasizes dynamic, living unity rather than static oneness.
    - Perichoresis is the basis for both divine unity and distinction.
    - "The unity of the triune God is the unity of the three Persons in their perichoresis." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

5. **Trinitarian Revelation**
    - God reveals himself as triune in the history of salvation.
    - Revelation is not merely propositional but participatory and relational.
    - The cross and resurrection are the fullest disclosure of trinitarian life.
    - Critiques any doctrine that abstracts God’s being from his self-revelation.
    - "God’s being is in his revelation, and his revelation is his being." (The Crucified God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s **social trinitarianism** has significantly shaped contemporary theology, challenging traditional Western emphases on divine unity at the expense of personal distinction. His critique of Van Til’s "one person" language has encouraged renewed attention to the relational and communal dimensions of the **Trinity**. Moltmann’s work continues to influence ecumenical dialogue and theological reflection on the implications of trinitarian doctrine for ecclesiology, anthropology, and social ethics.
