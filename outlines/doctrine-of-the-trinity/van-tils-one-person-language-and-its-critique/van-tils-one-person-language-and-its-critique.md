### ESSAY 1500-1800 words.
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
Van Til’s “one person” language names God as the personal absolute, asserting that the one God is both “one person” and “three persons,” with unity and plurality equally ultimate in the **triune God**. The dogmatic locus is **Theology Proper**, specifically pro-Nicene Trinitarian grammar concerned with the distinction between one essence and three **hypostases**. For classical theology, the ousia-hypostasis distinction safeguards **divine simplicity** and the concrete reality of Father, Son, and Spirit as coequal and coeternal. Van Til relocates the accent from abstraction to personality, insisting that the unity is not an impersonal what but a living who, while still confessing *homoousios* and the three **subsistences**.

The underlying motive is apologetic and metaphysical: only the **absolute personality of God** grounds meaning, knowledge, and morals against autonomous reason. In The Defense of the Faith (1955, rev. 1963) and An Introduction to Systematic Theology (1974), Van Til argues that non-Christian thought alternates between impersonal abstraction and chaotic plurality, a problem the Trinity uniquely resolves by the **equal ultimacy of unity and diversity**. The controversial phrase “one person” is thus meant to deny that the divine essence is a bare universal and to confess that the Godhead is personally alive in a way transcending creaturely **personal ontology**.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
Scripture teaches one God and three persons but never states that “God is one person,” a silence crucial for **dogmatic exegesis**. Deuteronomy 6:4 proclaims the Shema, “YHWH is one,” which testifies to monotheism without numerically counting persons; *echad* supports covenantal exclusivity rather than denying triune **personal distinctions**. In the New Testament, Matthew 28:19 and 2 Corinthians 13:14 name Father, Son, and Spirit with one divine name and shared blessing, while John 1:1, 18 and John 14–16 display eternal relations and distinct missions under **inseparable operations**. The biblical pattern yields one divine identity and three irreducible **hypostatic names**.

A pro-Nicene hermeneutic reads economy to immanent life by **Rahners Rule**: the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa, though not exhaustively. The Father sends the Son and Spirit; the Son is from the Father; the Spirit proceeds from the Father and through the Son, thereby manifesting eternal **processions** as missions. The Bible’s personal idiom is rich and relational, yet resists collapsing essence into a single center of consciousness; instead, it identifies three personal agents in one simple **deity**. Thus a scriptural baseline supports one essence, three persons, while “one person” as predication of essence requires careful **analogical qualification**.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
Nicaea 325 and Constantinople 381 secured the confession of one ousia and three **hypostases**, affirming the Son’s *homoousios* with the Father and the Spirit’s full divinity. The Cappadocians clarified that what is common is essence and what is incommunicable are **personal properties**: paternity, filiation, and procession. Augustine’s De Trinitate (399–419) stressed **inseparable operations**, teaching that external works are undivided, while sustaining real distinctions by relations of origin. None of these patristic voices call God “one person” in the absolute sense, because that would blur the hypostatic **distinctions**.

In the medieval synthesis, **Thomas Aquinas** defined persons as subsistent relations and guarded the unity by **divine simplicity**, ensuring there is not a fourth thing called “person of the essence.” On this account, the divine essence is not an individual alongside Father, Son, and Spirit; the essence is numerically one, wholly possessed by each person through distinct relations of **origin**. Medieval and later scholastic theologians therefore avoided predicating “one person” of the essence, lest they conflate the communicable with the incommunicable and imperil **orthodoxy**.

The Reformation inherited and polished this grammar. **Calvins autotheos** highlights that the Son is God of himself as to deity while eternally from the Father as to person, preserving both aseity and **eternal generation**. Post-Reformation scholastics like **Francis Turretin** (1623–1687) insisted that the essence is numerically one and the persons are really distinct subsistences, not modes or parts. Herman **Bavinck** (Reformed Dogmatics, 1895–1901) introduced the idiom of God as “absolute personality,” intending to deny impersonalism without denying the tri-personal reality; he explicitly refused to say God is “a” person, preferring **tripersonal**. Van Til inherits this personalist thrust but pushes it further, courting new **ambiguities**.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
Old Princeton, represented by **Charles Hodge** and **B. B. Warfield**, holds to classical **Latin Trinitarianism**. Warfield’s essay “The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity” (1915) insists on the one essence and three persons from the New Testament revelation while warning against speculative imagery; the Godhead is personal in the highest sense but not “one person” in confessional **grammar**. The Westminster Confession (1646–1647) carefully says that “in the unity of the Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity,” a formula avoiding any singular personal predication of **essence**.

Dutch Neo-Calvinism added a strong notion of God’s **absolute personality**. **Abraham Kuyper** (Stone Lectures, 1898) and Bavinck emphasize that only the triune God grounds creaturely personhood and society. Bavinck’s nuance is crucial: God is not “a” person, for that would suggest a fourth alongside the three; rather, God is **tripersonal being**, the fullness of personal life. This pluriform personality aims to secure both communion and unity without lapsing into either tritheism or an impersonal **substance**.

At Westminster Seminary, **Cornelius Van Til** synthesized Bavinck’s personalism with a presuppositional method. He argued that non-Christian thought cannot account for the **one-and-many** problem, whereas Christian theism, because of the Trinity, secures the equal ultimacy of unity and diversity. In that frame he sometimes wrote that “God is one person,” adding that God is also “three persons,” a claim defended by **Greg Bahnsen** and **John Frame** as analogical predication of the essence’s personal character, not as an assertion of unipersonalism. Sympathizers read Van Til as saying the one essence is **personal** in a way transcending created personhood, while critics worry the phrase is lexically and confessionally **misleading**.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
Roman Catholic theology follows Augustine and **Aquinas**, refusing to name the essence “one person,” while emphasizing **subsistent relations** and one simple nature. **Karl Rahner** in The Trinity (1967) reiterates identity between economic and immanent Trinity, urging that we not treat divine unity as an impersonal substratum; yet he retains the classic “one nature, three **persons**” formula. Catholic ressourcement thus reaches Van Til’s concern by different means: the unity is personal because the persons each fully subsist in the one **deity**.

Lutheran orthodoxy, from **Chemnitz** to **Quenstedt**, likewise confesses one essence and three **persons** with robust attention to *perichoresis* and to the clarity of catechesis. Lutheran symbols do not call God “one person,” preferring the Athanasian Creed’s stark precision and worshipful doxology, preserving **inseparable operations** alongside the personal missions of the Son and the **Spirit**. Their hymnody underscores personal address to Father, Son, and Spirit without collapsing them into a singular personal **subject**.

Modern proposals sharpen the contrast. **Karl Barth** speaks of one God in three **modes of being** (Seinsweisen), which some hear as modalistic but which Barth defended as personal distinctions within one subject of lordship. Social trinitarians like **Jürgen Moltmann** (The Trinity and the Kingdom, 1980), **Wolfhart Pannenberg**, and **John Zizioulas** emphasize communion and arguably risk dividing the unity into three centers of **agency**. In analytic theology, **Richard Swinburne** defends a social model, **Brian Leftow** a strong Latin unity model, and **Brower and Rea** deploy relative identity; these accounts revisit what “person” and “essence” mean, thereby sharpening evaluation of Van Til’s **terminology**.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
The central objection is that “one person” applied to the essence violates conciliar and confessional **grammar** and suggests **modalism** or Sabellian collapse. **Robert Letham** (The Holy Trinity, 2004) argues that Van Til’s phrase is pastorally and doctrinally confusing, since “person” in pro-Nicene usage designates the hypostasis and not the essence. **James Dolezal** (All That Is in God, 2017) warns that personalist rhetoric, untethered from **divine simplicity** and relations of origin, undermines immutability and risks introducing composition or a quaternary **subject**.

Defenders reply that Van Til spoke **analogically**, not univocally. **John Frame** reads the claim as saying that the one God is personal in the sense of being a self-revealing, covenant-making Lord, and that the three persons are not parts but the irreducible triune **subsistences**. **Greg Bahnsen** likewise insists that Van Til never denied three persons; the aim was to oppose impersonal essentialism and to ground apologetics in **triune absoluteness**. On this interpretation, “one person” is shorthand for “the one God is personal,” a predication not of a fourth hypostasis but of **divine being** as living.

A constructive way forward is to tighten terms while keeping Van Til’s insight. We can affirm the **absolute personality of God** and the equal ultimacy of unity and diversity, yet reserve “person” for Father, Son, and Spirit and use “personal” or “tripersonal” for the essence, in line with **Bavinck**. Teaching can stress the classic rule: one essence, three persons, with inseparable operations *ad extra* and distinct relations *ad intra*, so that the apologetic payoff is retained without risking **confessional dissonance**.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
In prolegomena and Bibliology, Van Til’s emphasis on the **personal absolute** relates to revelation as covenantal self-disclosure and Scripture as the principium of **theological knowledge**. If God is absolutely personal, knowledge is dialogical and dependent, rejecting neutral reason. This embeds epistemology within **Trinitarian ontology**, where Father speaks in the Son by the Spirit, and theology is a hearing of personal address rather than analysis of impersonal **being**.

In Christology, we must not transfer idioms across loci: the eternal Son is one **person** in two natures, whereas the Trinity is one essence in three persons. Confusing these structures yields category errors that compound the “one person” issue. In Soteriology, **inseparable operations** ensure that the Father sends, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies one salvation, maintaining both unity and hypostatic **appropriations**. In Anthropology and Ecclesiology, the image of God realizes personal relationality and sociality analogically, grounding human dignity and church communion in **tripersonal** being.

In apologetics, Van Til’s **transcendental argument** hinges on the Trinity’s resolution of the one-and-many problem: only a God whose unity and diversity are equally ultimate can ground universals and particulars, community and individuality, logic and history. When articulated with classical **divine simplicity** and conciliar grammar, this claim avoids idiosyncrasy and invites broader catholic reception, while still pressing the antithesis with **autonomous** thought.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastorally, catechesis should teach the **one essence three persons** formula with biblical texts and confessional lines, explaining why “God is one person” is at best ambiguous and at worst misleading. Prayer is addressed to the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit, which models **inseparable operations** and personal distinctions in worship. Liturgically, the Gloria Patri and trinitarian collects rehearse the grammar of **tripersonal** praise, shaping the church’s imagination so that worship prevents doctrinal drift.

Spiritually, Van Til’s concern reassures believers that the Lord they meet is not an impersonal force but the **absolute personality of God** who covenants, loves, and judges. Missionally, preaching can connect the world’s hunger for meaning and community to the **triune God**, who grounds both unity and diversity without collapse. Pastors can thus harvest Van Til’s apologetic aim while trimming the lexical hedge to stay within catholic **Trinitarian** speech.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
Van Til’s “one person” idiom should be received as a zeal for the **absolute personal** God and refined into tripersonal, pro-Nicene grammar that keeps the apologetic fruit without the terminological thorns of confusion.
