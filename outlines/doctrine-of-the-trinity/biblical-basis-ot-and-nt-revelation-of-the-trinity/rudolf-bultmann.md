# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **biblical revelation of the Trinity** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He argued that both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament** present their witness to God, Christ, and the Spirit in existential terms rather than as systematic **Trinitarian doctrine**, emphasizing the kerygma over metaphysical formulations.

- "The New Testament does not contain a doctrine of the Trinity in the sense of later dogmatic developments." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament
- New Testament and Mythology
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting
- Essays Philosophical and Theological

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scriptural Language**
    - The language of **Father, Son, and Spirit** in the Bible is mythological and must be interpreted existentially.
    - Bultmann sought to uncover the existential meaning behind biblical texts, not their metaphysical claims.
    - He believed the **Trinity** as dogma is a later theological development, not a biblical teaching.
    - The focus is on the proclamation (kerygma), not ontological formulations.
    - "Mythological statements in the New Testament must be interpreted so as to disclose their existential meaning." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter with God**
    - Revelation is not propositional but occurs in the existential encounter with the divine.
    - The biblical witness to God, Christ, and Spirit points to the individual's confrontation with God's call.
    - The **Trinitarian formulae** are secondary to the existential response of faith.
    - The New Testament's significance lies in its call to authentic existence, not in metaphysical speculation.
    - "Faith is the response to the kerygma, not assent to metaphysical doctrine." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Historical-Critical Approach to Scripture**
    - The Old and New Testaments must be read with attention to their historical context.
    - Bultmann distinguished between the historical Jesus and the Christ of faith.
    - He argued that the **Trinity** is not a concept found in the earliest strata of biblical revelation.
    - The development of Trinitarian doctrine reflects the church's later theological reflection.
    - "The New Testament writers do not present a doctrine of the Trinity but speak of God, Jesus, and the Spirit in various ways." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The heart of the New Testament is the proclamation of Christ, not doctrinal formulations.
    - The **Trinitarian language** serves the proclamation, not systematic theology.
    - The transformative power of the gospel is found in the existential decision it demands.
    - The biblical witness is dynamic and existential, not static or metaphysical.
    - "The kerygma is not a doctrine but a summons to decision." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Rejection of Metaphysical Speculation**
    - Bultmann rejected metaphysical explanations of the Trinity as foreign to the biblical message.
    - He viewed later dogmatic developments as products of Hellenistic thought, not biblical revelation.
    - The meaning of biblical references to Father, Son, and Spirit is existential, not ontological.
    - The focus is on the individual's relationship to God as revealed in Christ.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a biblical doctrine but a later theological construction." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **biblical basis of the Trinity** profoundly shaped modern biblical scholarship, especially through his emphasis on **demythologization** and existential interpretation. His work challenged traditional readings of both the Old and New Testaments, insisting that the **Trinitarian doctrine** is a post-biblical development. While controversial, his historical-critical and existential methods continue to influence debates on the nature of biblical revelation and the development of Christian doctrine. Bultmann remains a pivotal figure in discussions about the relationship between biblical texts and later theological formulations.
