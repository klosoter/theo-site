# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til argued that the **doctrine of the Trinity** is not merely a later theological construct but is rooted in both **Old Testament revelation** and **New Testament fulfillment**. He insisted that the **self-revelation of God** as triune is the foundation for all Christian theology, and that both testaments progressively unveil the unity and diversity within the Godhead, culminating in the explicit teaching of the **Trinity** in the New Testament.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a deduction but a revelation, and it is the presupposition of all intelligible predication." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian presupposition in revelation**
   - The **Trinity** is the necessary presupposition for all revelation in both the Old and New Testaments.
   - All biblical revelation reflects the unity and diversity of the triune God.
   - The **ontological Trinity** grounds the possibility of communication between God and creation.
   - The self-contained God of Scripture is revealed as triune from the very beginning.
   - "The whole of Christian theism stands or falls with the doctrine of the ontological Trinity." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Progressive revelation of the Trinity**
   - The Old Testament contains real but less explicit revelation of the triune nature of God.
   - The New Testament brings the **Trinitarian** structure of God’s being into full light.
   - There is continuity between Old and New Testament revelation regarding God’s unity and plurality.
   - The **Trinity** is not imposed on the text but emerges from the unfolding biblical narrative.
   - "The New Testament does not add a new God to the Old but reveals more clearly the triune nature of the one God." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Unity and diversity in the Godhead**
   - The biblical God is both one and many, reflecting **unity and diversity** within the Godhead.
   - Old Testament hints (e.g., plural pronouns, the Angel of the Lord) anticipate fuller New Testament revelation.
   - The New Testament explicitly names **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** as coequal and coeternal.
   - The doctrine of the Trinity safeguards both the oneness and threeness of God.
   - "The equal ultimacy of unity and diversity is found only in the ontological Trinity." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Revelation is covenantal and personal**
   - God’s self-revelation is always **covenantal**, involving personal address to His people.
   - The triune God relates to His creation through covenant in both testaments.
   - The personal distinctions within the Godhead are essential for genuine revelation and relationship.
   - The **Trinity** is the foundation for God’s redemptive acts in history.
   - "God’s covenantal revelation is possible only because God is triune." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Antithesis with non-Christian views of God**
   - Non-Christian philosophies cannot account for the biblical revelation of the **Trinity**.
   - Only the triune God of Scripture provides the precondition for intelligibility and meaning.
   - The biblical doctrine of God stands in antithesis to all forms of unitarianism or polytheism.
   - The **Trinity** is essential for a distinctly Christian worldview and apologetic.
   - "It is the doctrine of the Trinity that alone makes Christianity intelligible and defensible." (Christian Apologetics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of the **Trinity** as the foundation for all revelation has profoundly shaped Reformed theology and apologetics. His insistence on the **presuppositional necessity** of the triune God for intelligible revelation has influenced generations of theologians and apologists. By rooting the doctrine of the Trinity in both Old and New Testament revelation, Van Til provided a framework for understanding the unity of Scripture and the uniqueness of the Christian worldview. His work remains central in discussions of **biblical theology**, revelation, and the defense of the faith.
