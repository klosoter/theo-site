# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **Trinity** as a central doctrine, insisting that both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament** reveal the one God in three persons: **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit**. He emphasized the continuity of **divine revelation** across the Testaments, arguing that the triune nature of God is present from Genesis through the apostolic witness, though more fully disclosed in Christ.

- "Thus the Christian faith is that we worship one God in three persons and three persons in one God." (Large Catechism)

## Key Works

- The Large Catechism (especially the sections on the Apostles’ Creed)
- The Small Catechism
- Lectures on Genesis
- Sermons on John
- Commentary on Galatians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity and Distinction in the Trinity**
    - God is one in essence but three in persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - The Old Testament hints at plurality within the Godhead (e.g., Genesis 1:26).
    - The New Testament reveals the Trinity explicitly, especially in Christ’s baptism and the Great Commission.
    - The persons are coequal and coeternal, sharing the same divine majesty.
    - "We must adore the majesty of God, who is one in essence and three in persons." (Large Catechism)

2. **Christocentric Revelation of the Trinity**
    - Christ is the fullest revelation of the triune God.
    - The New Testament unveils the Trinity most clearly in the person and work of Jesus.
    - The Old Testament anticipates Christ, who reveals the Father and sends the Spirit.
    - Faith in Christ is inseparable from faith in the triune God.
    - "No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him." (Sermons on John)

3. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - The doctrine of the Trinity is grounded in Scripture, not human speculation.
    - Both Testaments provide the basis for Trinitarian confession.
    - Key texts include Genesis 1, Isaiah 6, Matthew 3, and Matthew 28.
    - The church’s creeds summarize, but do not supersede, biblical teaching.
    - "We derive our knowledge of the Trinity from the Word of God alone." (Large Catechism)

4. **Rejection of Rationalistic Speculation**
    - Human reason cannot fully comprehend the mystery of the Trinity.
    - Attempts to explain the Trinity apart from Scripture lead to error.
    - Faith accepts the biblical witness even when it surpasses understanding.
    - The mystery of the Trinity calls for humility and worship.
    - "Where God’s Word is silent, we ought not to speak or speculate." (Large Catechism)

5. **Trinitarian Shape of Christian Life and Worship**
    - Baptism and prayer are explicitly Trinitarian acts.
    - The Christian life is lived in communion with Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The Trinity is confessed in the creeds and liturgy of the church.
    - The believer’s relationship with God is shaped by the triune economy of salvation.
    - "We are baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and thus are made Christians." (Small Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of the **Trinity** shaped Protestant confessional identity and reinforced the continuity of **biblical revelation** from Old to New Testament. His catechetical works ensured that Trinitarian doctrine remained central in the teaching and worship of the Reformation churches. By grounding the doctrine in Scripture and emphasizing its mystery, Luther influenced later Protestant approaches to the doctrine of God and the interpretation of both Testaments.
