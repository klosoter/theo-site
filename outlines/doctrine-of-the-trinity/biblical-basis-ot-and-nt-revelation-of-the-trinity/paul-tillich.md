# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **doctrine of the Trinity** not as a direct result of the **biblical revelation** in the Old and New Testaments, but as a **symbolic expression** of the Christian experience of God. He argued that the **Trinitarian structure** emerges from the existential encounter with the **divine self-manifestation** rather than from explicit scriptural formulations, interpreting biblical texts through the lens of **philosophical theology** and **systematic symbolism**.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a biblical doctrine in the sense that it is explicitly stated in the Bible; it is a theological interpretation of the biblical message." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinity as Symbolic Expression**
    - The Trinity is a symbol pointing to the **depth of the divine life** rather than a literal description.
    - Tillich sees Trinitarian language as necessary for expressing the **Christian experience** of God’s self-disclosure.
    - He maintains that the **biblical witness** provides the foundation for Trinitarian symbols, though not explicit formulations.
    - The Trinity functions as a way to articulate the **unity and diversity** within the Godhead.
    - "The Trinity is a symbol for the dynamic and relational character of the divine life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Biblical Revelation as Existential Encounter**
    - Tillich interprets **revelation** as the event in which the ground of being becomes manifest to human existence.
    - The Old and New Testaments are seen as records of such existential encounters, not as propositional doctrines.
    - He emphasizes the **self-manifestation** of God in history, culminating in the Christ event.
    - The biblical basis for the Trinity is indirect, rooted in the **experience of God as Father, Son, and Spirit**.
    - "Revelation is the manifestation of the ground of being in existential experience." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Christ as the Center of Trinitarian Revelation**
    - For Tillich, the **Christ event** is the decisive moment of divine self-disclosure.
    - The New Testament witness to Christ reveals the **dynamic unity** of God.
    - The relationship between Christ and the Spirit in the New Testament points to the **Trinitarian structure**.
    - The Old Testament prepares for this by its witness to the living God, but does not articulate the Trinity.
    - "The Christological element is the center from which the Trinitarian symbols gain their meaning." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Philosophical Mediation of Biblical Data**
    - Tillich employs **philosophical categories** to interpret biblical revelation.
    - He argues that the Trinity must be understood in existential and ontological terms, not merely biblical or historical.
    - The **Trinitarian formula** arises from the need to express the complexity of the divine-human encounter.
    - The biblical texts are mediated through the lens of **systematic theology** and philosophical reflection.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the result of the encounter between the biblical message and philosophical thought." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Unity and Diversity in God**
    - Tillich stresses the **unity of the divine ground** while affirming the diversity of its manifestations.
    - The Old Testament emphasizes the unity of God; the New Testament introduces relational distinctions.
    - The Trinity expresses the **paradox of unity and differentiation** within the Godhead.
    - This unity-in-diversity is essential for understanding the biblical witness to God’s self-revelation.
    - "The Trinitarian symbols express the unity and diversity of the divine life as experienced in revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to the **Trinity** has significantly influenced modern **systematic theology**, especially in its emphasis on the symbolic and existential dimensions of doctrine. His reading of the **biblical basis** for the Trinity as indirect and mediated by philosophical reflection has shaped contemporary debates about the relationship between **Scripture** and doctrine. While his views have been critiqued for downplaying the explicit biblical witness, Tillich’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to relate classical Christian doctrines to modern existential concerns.
