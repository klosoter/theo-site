# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust **Trinitarian theology** grounded in both **Old Testament** and **New Testament revelation**. They affirm the unity and distinction of the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** as revealed progressively in Scripture, emphasizing the continuity of **divine self-disclosure** from Genesis to Revelation. The confessions draw on biblical texts to defend the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the three persons within the one **divine essence**.

- "We believe in one only God, who is one single essence, in which are three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct according to their incommunicable properties." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 8–11
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Lord’s Days 8–9
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), relevant doctrinal affirmations
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scriptural Foundation for the Trinity**
   - Asserts that both **OT and NT** reveal the one God in three persons.
   - Cites Genesis (creation, plural language) and NT baptismal formulae.
   - Emphasizes the progressive clarity of **Trinitarian revelation**.
   - Rejects any doctrine not founded on the explicit or implicit teaching of Scripture.
   - "This doctrine of the holy Trinity has always been maintained and preserved in the true church, since the time of the apostles to this very day, against Jews, Mohammedans, and some false Christians and heretics." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

2. **Unity of Divine Essence**
   - Affirms that the three persons share the same **divine substance**.
   - Stresses the oneness of God as foundational to biblical monotheism.
   - Denies any division or composition in the divine being.
   - Upholds the simplicity and indivisibility of God.
   - "We believe in one only God, who is one single essence." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

3. **Distinction of Persons**
   - Teaches real, eternal distinctions among **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit**.
   - Grounds these distinctions in **personal properties** (unbegotten, begotten, proceeding).
   - Insists that these distinctions do not divide the essence.
   - Uses biblical texts (e.g., baptism of Jesus, apostolic benediction) as proof.
   - "The Father is the cause, origin, and beginning of all things visible and invisible; the Son is the Word, wisdom, and image of the Father; the Holy Spirit is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father and the Son." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

4. **Biblical Testimony from Old and New Testaments**
   - Identifies **Trinitarian hints** in the OT (e.g., Genesis 1:26, Isaiah 61:1).
   - Asserts full revelation of the Trinity in the NT (e.g., Matthew 3:16–17, 28:19).
   - Argues that the NT clarifies and confirms the OT’s veiled references.
   - Uses Scripture to refute anti-Trinitarian interpretations.
   - "In the Old Testament, therefore, we find that God speaks in the plural, 'Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness'; so also, 'Behold, man is become as one of Us.'" (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

5. **Necessity of Trinitarian Faith for Salvation**
   - Confesses that true knowledge of God requires faith in the **Triune God**.
   - Connects the Trinity to the heart of the gospel and Christian worship.
   - Rejects the salvation of those who deny the Trinity.
   - Catechetical instruction centers on the Trinity as the object of faith.
   - "Since there is but one only divine Being, it follows that whosoever denies the Son, denies also the Father and the Holy Spirit." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed confessional identity**, providing a clear and biblically grounded articulation of the **doctrine of the Trinity**. Their careful use of both Old and New Testament texts has served as a model for subsequent Reformed theology and catechesis. By insisting on the necessity of Trinitarian faith, these confessions have safeguarded the church against heresy and fostered a robust, worshipful understanding of the one true God revealed in Scripture.
