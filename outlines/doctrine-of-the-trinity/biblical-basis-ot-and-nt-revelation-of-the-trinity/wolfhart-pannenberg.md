# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **doctrine of the Trinity** by emphasizing the historical self-revelation of God in both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament**, culminating in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. He argued that the **Trinitarian identity** of God is not fully disclosed until the eschatological fulfillment, but that the biblical witness provides the foundation for understanding God as Father, Son, and Spirit in dynamic relation.

- "The biblical witness to the Trinity is inseparable from the history of revelation that reaches its climax in Jesus Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1
- Jesus—God and Man
- Revelation as History (editor and contributor)
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2
- The Idea of God and Human Freedom

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Historical and Eschatological**
    - God’s self-disclosure unfolds progressively through **salvation history**.
    - The **Old Testament** prepares for, but does not fully reveal, the Trinity.
    - The **New Testament** provides the decisive witness through the event of Christ.
    - Full understanding of the Trinity awaits the eschaton, when God’s identity is fully manifest.
    - "Only in the light of the end can the trinitarian reality of God be fully known." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Christology as the Center of Trinitarian Revelation**
    - The resurrection of Jesus is the key event revealing the divine Son.
    - **Jesus’ relationship to the Father** is the interpretive lens for biblical texts.
    - The Spirit’s role is understood through the mission of the Son and the church.
    - The New Testament’s witness to Jesus’ divinity is foundational for Trinitarian doctrine.
    - "The confession of Jesus as Son is the decisive step toward the doctrine of the Trinity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity between OT and NT**
    - The **Old Testament** reveals God’s unity and hints at plurality (e.g., Spirit, Wisdom).
    - The **New Testament** clarifies and expands these hints into explicit Trinitarian language.
    - Pannenberg resists reading later Trinitarian doctrine directly into the Old Testament.
    - He sees the **Trinity** as the fulfillment of the Old Testament’s preparatory revelation.
    - "The Old Testament does not know the Trinity, but it prepares for its disclosure." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Trinity as the Structure of Divine Revelation**
    - God’s revelation is inherently relational: Father, Son, and Spirit act in history.
    - The biblical narrative is the arena where the triune God is made known.
    - The unity and distinction of the persons are rooted in the biblical witness.
    - The Trinity is not an abstract doctrine but the pattern of God’s saving acts.
    - "The biblical testimony to God’s action is the basis for the doctrine of the Trinity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Scripture and Tradition in Trinitarian Formulation**
    - The **biblical canon** is primary for articulating the Trinity.
    - Later creedal formulations (e.g., Nicene Creed) are judged by their fidelity to Scripture.
    - Pannenberg values the historical development of doctrine but insists on biblical grounding.
    - He maintains a critical stance toward speculative Trinitarianism not rooted in revelation.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity must be derived from the biblical witness, not imposed upon it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to the **biblical basis of the Trinity** influenced contemporary theology by insisting on the primacy of **revelation in history** and the centrality of Christ’s resurrection. His work challenged both traditional dogmatics and modern skepticism by rooting Trinitarian doctrine in the unfolding narrative of Scripture. Pannenberg’s emphasis on the eschatological horizon and the unity of biblical revelation continues to shape discussions on the doctrine of God in both Protestant and ecumenical contexts.
