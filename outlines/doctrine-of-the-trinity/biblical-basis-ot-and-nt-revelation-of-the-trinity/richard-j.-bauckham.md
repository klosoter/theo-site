# Richard Bauckham (1946–)

Richard Bauckham is a leading New Testament scholar whose work has significantly shaped contemporary understanding of the **Trinity** by emphasizing the **biblical foundations** of **monotheism** and the **divine identity of Jesus**. He argues that both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament** reveal a coherent pattern in which Jesus is included within the unique **divine identity** of the one God of Israel, thus providing a robust scriptural basis for the doctrine of the Trinity.

- "The New Testament writers include Jesus in the unique divine identity of the one God of Israel." (Jesus and the God of Israel)

## Key Works

- Jesus and the God of Israel: God Crucified and Other Studies on the New Testament’s Christology of Divine Identity
- God Crucified: Monotheism and Christology in the New Testament
- The Theology of the Book of Revelation
- "Biblical Theology and the Problems of Monotheism" (in The Jewish World Around the New Testament)
- "Paul’s Christology of Divine Identity" (in Jesus and the God of Israel)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Identity Christology**
   - Jesus is included in the unique **divine identity** of the God of Israel.
   - The New Testament does not merely attribute divine functions to Jesus but identifies him with the one God.
   - This inclusion is rooted in the **Old Testament** understanding of God’s unique sovereignty and creatorship.
   - The early church’s **Trinitarian confession** arises from this scriptural pattern.
   - "The highest possible Christology is found in the New Testament, precisely in its inclusion of Jesus in the unique divine identity." (Jesus and the God of Israel)

2. **Continuity of Monotheism**
   - The New Testament maintains **Jewish monotheism** while reconfiguring it around Jesus.
   - There is no abandonment of the Shema; rather, Jesus is understood as sharing in the one divine name.
   - The **Old Testament** background is essential for understanding New Testament claims about Jesus.
   - The **Trinity** is not a later imposition but emerges from the scriptural witness.
   - "New Testament Christology is a development within the strict monotheism of Second Temple Judaism." (God Crucified)

3. **Scriptural Basis for the Trinity**
   - The doctrine of the **Trinity** is grounded in the biblical narrative, not merely in later theological reflection.
   - Key texts (e.g., Philippians 2, 1 Corinthians 8:6, Revelation) show Jesus’ participation in God’s unique prerogatives.
   - The **Holy Spirit** is also depicted as sharing in God’s identity and activity.
   - The **Trinitarian pattern** is implicit in the worship and language of the early church.
   - "The roots of the doctrine of the Trinity lie in the New Testament’s inclusion of Jesus and the Spirit in the unique identity of God." (Jesus and the God of Israel)

4. **Revelation and Divine Self-Disclosure**
   - God’s identity is revealed climactically in Jesus Christ.
   - The **Old Testament** anticipates God’s self-revelation, which is fulfilled in the New Testament.
   - The **Trinity** is not a speculative doctrine but a response to God’s historical self-disclosure.
   - Revelation is both **progressive** and consistent with Israel’s Scriptures.
   - "God reveals his identity in the story of Jesus, which is continuous with the story of Israel’s God." (God Crucified)

5. **Rejection of Mere Functional Christology**
   - Bauckham opposes views that see Jesus as merely functioning on God’s behalf.
   - He insists on an **ontological** inclusion of Jesus in the divine identity.
   - The **Trinitarian confession** is not about roles but about who God is.
   - The New Testament’s **worship** of Jesus is evidence of his divine status.
   - "The worship of Jesus as divine is possible only if he is included in the unique divine identity." (Jesus and the God of Israel)

## Legacy and Impact

Bauckham’s work has been pivotal in re-centering the **biblical basis** for the doctrine of the Trinity, especially by highlighting the continuity between **Old Testament monotheism** and **New Testament Christology**. His emphasis on the **divine identity** framework has influenced both evangelical and broader ecumenical scholarship. Bauckham’s arguments have challenged older models that separated biblical exegesis from dogmatic theology, fostering renewed confidence in the scriptural roots of the **Trinitarian confession**. His scholarship continues to shape debates on the relationship between **Second Temple Judaism** and early Christian doctrine.
