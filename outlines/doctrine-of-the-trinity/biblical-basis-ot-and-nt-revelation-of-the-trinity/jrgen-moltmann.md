# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann grounds his understanding of the **biblical revelation of the Trinity** in the dynamic, relational, and historical self-disclosure of God throughout the **Old Testament** and **New Testament**. He insists that the **Trinitarian God** is revealed not as a static abstraction but through the concrete events of **salvation history**, especially the **cross and resurrection of Christ**, and that the biblical witness points to a God who is inherently communal and open to the world.

- "The history of Jesus is the history of God, and the history of God is the history of Jesus." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Key Works

- The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God
- Theology of Hope
- The Crucified God
- Experiences in Theology
- God in Creation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinity Rooted in Biblical Narrative**
    - The **Trinitarian revelation** is grounded in the biblical witness, not merely in later dogmatic formulations.
    - The **Old Testament** hints at plurality within God through texts like Genesis 1 and prophetic visions.
    - The **New Testament** reveals the Trinity through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and the sending of the Spirit.
    - The biblical narrative unfolds the **relationality** and **mutual indwelling** of Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is nothing other than the conceptual framework for the biblical history of God with the world." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

2. **Economic Trinity as Revelation of the Immanent Trinity**
    - God’s triune being is revealed in the **economy of salvation**.
    - The **cross** and **resurrection** are the central events where the triune God is made known.
    - The sending of the **Spirit** at Pentecost completes the revelation of the Trinity.
    - The **immanent Trinity** is not hidden behind the economic but is disclosed through it.
    - "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

3. **Relational and Social Model of the Trinity**
    - The Trinity is best understood as a **community of persons** in loving relationship.
    - Biblical texts point to the **perichoresis** (mutual indwelling) of Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The **social doctrine** of the Trinity challenges monarchical or solitary conceptions of God.
    - The biblical witness calls the church to reflect this relationality in its own life.
    - "God is not a solitary ruler, but a community of love." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **Suffering and Participation in the Divine Life**
    - The **crucifixion** reveals the depth of God’s involvement in human suffering.
    - The **Father, Son, and Spirit** are all present and active in the event of the cross.
    - The biblical narrative shows God’s openness to the world and capacity to suffer with creation.
    - The Trinity invites believers into participation in the divine life through Christ and the Spirit.
    - "In the cross, the Son suffers abandonment, the Father suffers the loss of the Son, and the Spirit binds them in love." (The Crucified God)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment of Trinitarian Revelation**
    - The full revelation of the Trinity is oriented toward the **eschatological future**.
    - The **biblical promise** points to the consummation of God’s triune fellowship with creation.
    - The Spirit’s presence in the church is a foretaste of the coming **kingdom of God**.
    - The Trinity is the ground and goal of history as revealed in Scripture.
    - "The trinitarian history of God is open to the future and leads creation into the freedom of the children of God." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach to the **biblical basis of the Trinity** has significantly influenced contemporary theology, especially in emphasizing the **relational and social dimensions** of the doctrine. His insistence on rooting Trinitarian theology in the biblical narrative has challenged both classical metaphysical approaches and modern reductionism. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire theologians to read the Old and New Testaments as a unified witness to the dynamic, communal, and redemptive life of the triune God.
