# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. emphasizes that the **doctrine of the Trinity** is rooted in the progressive **revelation** of both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament**. He argues that while the **Trinitarian** reality is present in the Old Testament in **anticipatory** and **veiled** forms, it is fully unveiled in the New Testament through the redemptive work of Christ and the outpouring of the Spirit.

- "The New Testament is the capstone of the Old Testament’s trinitarian foundation, making explicit what was previously implicit." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- The Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "The Trinity in the New Testament" (in The New Dictionary of Biblical Theology)
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Progressive Revelation of the Trinity**
    - The Old Testament contains **anticipatory patterns** and hints of the Trinity, especially in theophanies and the language of God’s Word and Spirit.
    - The New Testament provides the **full disclosure** of the triune God, especially in the missions of the Son and the Spirit.
    - The unity of the testaments is essential for understanding the **organic development** of Trinitarian doctrine.
    - The Trinity is not a later imposition but arises from the **biblical narrative** itself.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not superimposed on Scripture but emerges from its redemptive-historical structure." (New Dictionary of Biblical Theology)

2. **Christocentric Revelation**
    - The person and work of **Jesus Christ** are central to the New Testament’s unveiling of the Trinity.
    - Christ’s resurrection and exaltation are pivotal for understanding his divine identity.
    - The sending of the Son reveals the **eternal relationship** between Father and Son.
    - The New Testament’s witness to Christ’s deity is foundational for Trinitarian confession.
    - "The resurrection is the decisive event in which the Son’s divine identity is revealed." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Pneumatological Fulfillment**
    - The outpouring of the **Holy Spirit** at Pentecost is the climactic revelation of the Spirit’s personhood and deity.
    - The Spirit’s work in the Old Testament anticipates the fuller revelation in the New.
    - The Spirit’s role in the life of Christ and the church demonstrates his distinct personhood.
    - The New Testament’s teaching on the Spirit completes the biblical witness to the Trinity.
    - "Pentecost marks the definitive self-revelation of the Spirit as the third person of the Trinity." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
    - The Trinity is revealed through the unfolding of **redemptive history**, not abstract speculation.
    - Key events—incarnation, resurrection, Pentecost—are the loci of Trinitarian revelation.
    - The Old Testament must be read in light of its fulfillment in Christ and the Spirit.
    - The unity of God’s saving acts reveals the unity and distinction of the divine persons.
    - "Redemptive history is the matrix in which the triune God makes himself known." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Scriptural Authority and Sufficiency**
    - The doctrine of the Trinity is grounded in the **exegesis** of Scripture, not philosophical categories.
    - Both testaments are necessary for a full doctrine of God.
    - The church’s Trinitarian confession is accountable to the biblical witness.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture ensures that the Trinity is a revealed, not constructed, doctrine.
    - "Scripture alone is the source and norm for our knowledge of the triune God." (New Dictionary of Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has reinforced the **Reformed commitment** to the unity of **biblical theology** and systematic doctrine, especially regarding the Trinity. His redemptive-historical approach has shaped contemporary understanding of how the Old and New Testaments together reveal the triune God. By emphasizing the organic development of Trinitarian revelation, Gaffin has influenced both academic and pastoral treatments of the doctrine. His insistence on the sufficiency and authority of Scripture remains a hallmark of his theological legacy.
