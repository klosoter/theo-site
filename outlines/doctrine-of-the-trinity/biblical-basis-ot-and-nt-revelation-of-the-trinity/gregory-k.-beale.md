# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale is a leading evangelical biblical scholar whose work emphasizes the **unity of Scripture** and the **progressive revelation** of the **Trinity** from the Old Testament to the New Testament. Beale argues that the **Trinitarian nature of God** is present in **seed form** in the Old Testament and is made explicit in the New Testament, particularly through the use of **typology**, **intertextuality**, and **divine identity** themes.

- "The Old Testament contains the raw materials for the doctrine of the Trinity, which are then more fully developed and clarified in the New Testament." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- A New Testament Biblical Theology: The Unfolding of the Old Testament in the New
- The Temple and the Church’s Mission: A Biblical Theology of the Dwelling Place of God
- The Book of Revelation (NIGTC)
- Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament (co-edited with D.A. Carson)
- God Dwells Among Us (with Mitchell Kim)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuity of Trinitarian Revelation**
   - The Old Testament provides foundational **hints** and **patterns** that anticipate the fuller revelation of the Trinity.
   - New Testament writers interpret Old Testament texts as referring to **Father, Son, and Spirit**.
   - The **divine plurality** in the Old Testament (e.g., "Let us make man") is not fully explained until the New Testament.
   - The **unity of God** is maintained even as the distinct persons are progressively revealed.
   - "The New Testament authors saw themselves as standing within the trajectory of Old Testament revelation, now clarified in light of Christ and the Spirit." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

2. **Typological Fulfillment in Christ**
   - Old Testament figures and events serve as **types** that are fulfilled in the person and work of Christ.
   - Jesus is portrayed as the **divine Son** who shares in the identity of Yahweh.
   - The **temple motif** is reinterpreted Christologically and Trinitarianly in the New Testament.
   - Typology demonstrates the **organic connection** between the testaments regarding God's triune nature.
   - "Typology is a divinely intended correspondence between persons, events, and institutions in the Old and New Testaments." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

3. **Divine Identity Christology**
   - The New Testament attributes **divine prerogatives** and **titles** to Jesus that belong to Yahweh.
   - Old Testament texts about Yahweh are applied to Jesus, indicating his inclusion in the **divine identity**.
   - The Spirit is also depicted as sharing in the divine identity, especially in relation to the exalted Christ.
   - This approach grounds the doctrine of the Trinity in the **biblical text** rather than later philosophical categories.
   - "The New Testament authors identify Jesus with Yahweh by applying Old Testament Yahweh texts to him." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

4. **Intertextual Exegesis**
   - Beale emphasizes the importance of **Old Testament quotations and allusions** in the New Testament for understanding the Trinity.
   - The New Testament writers use **intertextual methods** to reveal the triune God.
   - Key passages (e.g., Psalm 110, Isaiah 63) are re-read in light of Christ and the Spirit.
   - This method demonstrates the **hermeneutical unity** of Scripture regarding God's triune nature.
   - "The New Testament’s use of the Old Testament is central for understanding the development of Trinitarian doctrine." (Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament)

5. **Eschatological Unveiling of the Trinity**
   - The full revelation of the Trinity is tied to the **eschatological arrival** of Christ and the Spirit.
   - The **outpouring of the Spirit** in the New Testament is seen as a fulfillment of Old Testament promises.
   - The **heavenly temple** imagery in Revelation points to the presence of Father, Son, and Spirit.
   - The **Trinitarian pattern** is especially evident in the worship scenes of the book of Revelation.
   - "The eschatological age brings the clearest revelation of the triune God as Father, Son, and Spirit." (The Book of Revelation)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s scholarship has significantly shaped evangelical understanding of the **biblical foundations of the Trinity**, especially through his emphasis on **typology** and **intertextuality**. His work has encouraged a more robust engagement with the Old Testament as essential for Trinitarian theology. By grounding the doctrine in the **unity of redemptive history**, Beale has provided tools for both academic and pastoral engagement with the doctrine of the Trinity. His influence is evident in contemporary biblical theology and in the renewed appreciation for the Old Testament’s role in Christian doctrine.
