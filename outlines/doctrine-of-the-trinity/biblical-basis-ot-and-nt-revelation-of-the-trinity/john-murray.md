# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the **biblical doctrine of the Trinity** by emphasizing its organic development across both the **Old and New Testaments**, insisting that the **unity and diversity** within the Godhead are progressively revealed. He maintained that the **Trinitarian structure** is foundational to both **redemptive history** and the self-disclosure of God, with the New Testament providing the fullest clarity while the Old Testament contains essential preparatory revelation.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is not the product of speculation but is derived from the data of divine revelation." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "Redemption—Accomplished and Applied"
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT Commentary)
- "The Nature and Authority of Scripture" (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)
- "Christian Baptism" (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Progressive Revelation of the Trinity**
    - The Old Testament contains **anticipations** and **shadows** of Trinitarian distinctions.
    - The New Testament brings **full disclosure** of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - Murray stresses the **continuity** between the Testaments in revealing the Godhead.
    - He rejects any notion that the Trinity is a purely New Testament innovation.
    - "The revelation of the Trinity is not abrupt but is the outcome of the whole process of redemptive revelation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Scriptural Foundation over Speculation**
    - Murray insists that the doctrine arises from **exegesis** of biblical texts, not philosophical constructs.
    - He highlights **key passages** (e.g., Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14) as explicit Trinitarian formulations.
    - The **unity of God** is never compromised by the revelation of three persons.
    - He is critical of approaches that read later dogma into the biblical text without warrant.
    - "We must derive our doctrine of the Trinity from the witness of Scripture itself." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Unity and Distinction within the Godhead**
    - Murray affirms the **oneness of God** as foundational to biblical monotheism.
    - He maintains the **personal distinctions** of Father, Son, and Spirit are real and eternal.
    - The distinctions are revealed in the **economy of redemption** but grounded in the **immanent Trinity**.
    - He rejects modalism and subordinationism as contrary to biblical teaching.
    - "The distinctions within the Godhead are not merely economic but belong to the eternal being of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Christological and Pneumatological Emphasis**
    - The person and work of **Christ** are central to the New Testament revelation of the Trinity.
    - The **Holy Spirit** is presented as a distinct person, not merely an impersonal force.
    - Murray underscores the **interpersonal relationships** revealed in the baptism and mission of Jesus.
    - He sees the **sending** of the Son and Spirit as key to understanding intra-Trinitarian relations.
    - "The New Testament revelation of the Trinity is inseparable from the revelation of Christ and the Spirit." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Context**
    - The doctrine of the Trinity is rooted in the **history of redemption**, not abstract speculation.
    - Murray connects the **covenant** structure of Scripture with the triune God’s self-disclosure.
    - He argues that the **Trinity** is essential for understanding **revelation, redemption, and worship**.
    - The biblical narrative itself is inherently **Trinitarian** in shape and content.
    - "The whole process of redemption is Trinitarian in its structure and execution." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s careful exegesis and commitment to the **biblical foundations** of the Trinity have shaped generations of Reformed theologians. His insistence on the organic unity of **Old and New Testament revelation** provided a robust framework for understanding the progressive disclosure of God’s triune nature. Murray’s work continues to influence discussions on **systematic theology** and the interpretation of Scripture within confessional Reformed circles.
