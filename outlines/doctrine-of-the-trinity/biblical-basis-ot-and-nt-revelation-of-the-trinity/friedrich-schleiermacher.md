# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the **doctrine of the Trinity** by grounding it in the **feeling of absolute dependence** and the communal **religious experience** of the Church, rather than in direct **biblical revelation** from the **Old and New Testaments**. He argued that the Trinity is not explicitly revealed in Scripture but is a later doctrinal development, serving as a symbolic expression of the Christian community’s experience of God in Christ and the Spirit.

- "The dogma of the Trinity did not form part of the original message of Jesus; it was added by the Church." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - Theology is founded on the **feeling of absolute dependence**, not on propositional revelation.
    - The Trinity arises from the communal experience of redemption, not from explicit biblical teaching.
    - Scripture is valued as a witness to religious experience, not as a direct source of dogmatic formulations.
    - The **Old Testament** is preparatory, and the **New Testament** reflects the community’s evolving understanding of God.
    "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Trinity as Post-Biblical Development**
    - The doctrine of the Trinity is not directly taught in either the Old or New Testament.
    - Trinitarian language emerges from the Church’s reflection on the person and work of Christ and the Spirit.
    - The biblical witness is seen as ambiguous or silent regarding the ontological Trinity.
    - The Trinity is a symbolic construct to express the unity and diversity of the divine in Christian experience.
    "The dogma of the Trinity... was a product of reflection, not of immediate Christian consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Christocentric Focus**
    - Christ is central as the mediator of the divine-human relationship.
    - The New Testament’s witness to Christ is foundational for Christian doctrine, but not for metaphysical speculation.
    - The divinity of Christ is affirmed in terms of his unique God-consciousness.
    - The Spirit is understood as the presence of Christ in the community, not as a distinct biblical person.
    "The Redeemer is the one in whom the divine essence is most perfectly revealed." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Scripture as Historical Witness**
    - The Bible is a record of the evolving religious consciousness of the community.
    - Doctrines must be grounded in the lived faith of the Church, not in proof-texting.
    - The Old Testament is not a source for Trinitarian doctrine; the New Testament is ambiguous.
    - The authority of Scripture is subordinate to the authority of religious experience.
    "Scripture is the original document of the religious self-consciousness of the Church." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Doctrine as Expression, Not Explanation**
    - Doctrines like the Trinity are expressions of communal faith, not metaphysical explanations.
    - Theological language is symbolic and functional, not ontological.
    - The Trinity articulates the structure of Christian piety rather than biblical revelation.
    - The value of doctrine lies in its capacity to express the faith of the community.
    "Dogmatic formulas are not explanations, but expressions of the religious life." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to the **Trinity** profoundly shaped modern theology by shifting the focus from **biblical revelation** to **religious experience** and the historical development of doctrine. His views challenged traditional readings of the Old and New Testaments as direct sources for Trinitarian dogma, influencing later liberal and existential theologians. While often criticized by confessional traditions, his emphasis on the experiential and communal dimensions of doctrine remains a significant force in contemporary theological discussions.
