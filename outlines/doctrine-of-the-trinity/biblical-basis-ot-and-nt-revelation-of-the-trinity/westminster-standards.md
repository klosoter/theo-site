# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of the **Trinity** grounded in both **Old Testament** and **New Testament revelation**. They emphasize the unity of the **Godhead** and the co-equality and co-eternity of the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit**, drawing on scriptural testimony to affirm the full deity and distinct personhood of each. The Standards maintain that the doctrine of the Trinity is revealed progressively, with clearer manifestation in the New Testament, yet truly present in the Old.

- "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost." (Westminster Confession of Faith 2.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 2 ("Of God, and of the Holy Trinity")
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 6–11
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 4–6
- The Westminster Assembly’s Annotations on the Old and New Testaments
- The Minutes and Papers of the Westminster Assembly, 1643–1652 (for historical context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity and Simplicity of the Godhead**
   - Asserts that God is one in **essence** and undivided in being.
   - Emphasizes that the three persons are not three gods, but one God.
   - Affirms that all divine attributes are fully possessed by each person.
   - Maintains that the divine essence is not partitioned among the persons.
   - "There is but one only, living, and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection." (WCF 2.1)

2. **Distinction of Persons**
   - Teaches that the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** are distinguished by personal properties.
   - Insists these distinctions do not divide the divine essence.
   - Each person is fully and truly God, not merely a mode or aspect.
   - The persons are distinguished by their relations of origin (begetting, begotten, proceeding).
   - "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity." (WCF 2.3)

3. **Scriptural Foundation in Both Testaments**
   - Affirms that the **Trinity** is revealed in both the Old and New Testaments.
   - Old Testament hints (e.g., plural language, the Angel of the Lord) are seen as preparatory.
   - New Testament revelation (e.g., baptismal formula, apostolic benedictions) is explicit and decisive.
   - The Standards cite specific texts (e.g., Matthew 3:16–17; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14) as proof.
   - "God is revealed to us as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, each with distinct personal properties." (WLC Q.11)

4. **Equality and Co-Eternity of the Persons**
   - Each person of the Trinity is fully God, equal in power and glory.
   - None is before or after another in time or dignity.
   - The Son is eternally begotten, and the Spirit eternally proceeds, not created or subordinate.
   - Rejects all forms of subordinationism or modalism.
   - "The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son." (WCF 2.3)

5. **Necessity of the Trinity for Christian Faith**
   - The doctrine is essential for a right understanding of **God** and salvation.
   - The Trinity is foundational for worship, prayer, and the Christian life.
   - Denial of the Trinity is considered a denial of the Christian faith itself.
   - The Standards urge catechesis and confession of the Trinity as central to orthodoxy.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable dependence on Him." (WLC Q.5, paraphrased)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** and confessional orthodoxy regarding the **Trinity**. Their careful articulation of the biblical basis for the doctrine, rooted in both Old and New Testament revelation, set a benchmark for subsequent Protestant confessions. The Standards’ influence endures in Presbyterian and Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring that the doctrine of the Trinity remains central to Christian faith and practice.
