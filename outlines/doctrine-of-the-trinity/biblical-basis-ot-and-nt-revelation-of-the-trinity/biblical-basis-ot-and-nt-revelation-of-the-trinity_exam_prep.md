### TITLE
Seeing the One Name: Progressive, canonical revelation of the Triune God from Israel’s Scriptures to the apostolic witness

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How the one God of Israel is revealed as Father, Son, and Spirit without compromising monotheism, and how the OT genuinely reveals this reality in seed while the NT brings it to mature light, under **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, and **eternal generation**.
- Decisive figures: Athanasius, Augustine, John Owen, B. B. Warfield, Richard Bauckham.
- Relevant traditions: Nicene patristic exegesis and dogma; Reformed biblical and dogmatic theology; contemporary NT scholarship on Second Temple Jewish monotheism and the inclusion of Jesus and the Spirit in the divine identity.
- Debates:
  - Internal: OT trinitarian reading and theophanies, personification vs hypostasis of Word and Wisdom, biblical basis for **eternal generation** and **procession**, and the scope of **inseparable operations**.
  - External: Arian and Socinian denial of Son and Spirit’s deity, Unitarian and Islamic critiques of Trinity as unbiblical, historical-critical claims of late dogmatic imposition.
  - Contemporary: Social trinitarian revisions, eternal functional subordination, canonical versus atomistic proof-texting, and divine council readings of the OT.
- Position defended: The biblical canon progressively reveals the one God as three persons; the OT gives real though veiled revelation through the Name, Word, Wisdom, Spirit, and the Angel of the Lord, and the NT, without violating Deuteronomic monotheism, unveils the Father, Son, and Spirit in a way that warrants Nicene **divine simplicity**, **eternal generation**, **procession**, and **inseparable operations**.

### ESSAY
The doctrine of the Trinity is not a speculative superstructure laid upon the Bible but the necessary conceptual grammar required by divine self‑disclosure in the canon. To defend the biblical basis of the Trinity across the Testaments, the central question is whether Scripture reveals the one God of Israel as Father, Son, and Spirit in such a way that monotheism is not compromised yet real personal distinctions are affirmed. The answer demands a canonical strategy: not a hunt for an isolated definition verse, but a synthesis of patterns, titles, divine prerogatives, and the economy of revelation that together yield the dogmatic conclusions of **divine simplicity**, **eternal generation**, **procession**, and **inseparable operations**.

The Old Testament establishes the bedrock of the discussion. Israel confesses the Lord our God, the Lord is one, and the prophets mock idols precisely because the Lord alone creates, rules providence, forgives, and receives worship. Yet within this unyielding monotheism, the Lord reveals himself through the Name, the Word, the Wisdom, the Glory, and the Spirit, and in certain narratives a messenger of the Lord appears who is identified as God and yet distinguished from God. The creation account is paradigmatic: God speaks, and by the Word the heavens are made; the Spirit of God hovers over the deep; and God says, let us make man in our image. This is not a cryptic code for three persons in a proof‑text sense, but an inaugural pattern of divine action by Word and Spirit that is never rescinded. Psalms and prophets expand the pattern: by the Word of the Lord the heavens were made and by the breath of his mouth all their host; Wisdom is with God from everlasting, the craftsman at his side; the Spirit rests upon the promised king, is poured out in the last days, and searches and knows in ways proper to God. Daniel sees one like a son of man who receives dominion and worship from all peoples in the presence of the Ancient of Days. Isaiah’s Servant speaks as one sent by the Lord God and his Spirit, and the New Covenant promise of the Spirit turns the hearts of stone to flesh with divine efficacy. These are not stray threads but a woven tapestry of one God whose Word and Spirit do what only God can do, and whose purposes are mediated by a figure who is distinct and yet bears divine identity.

Here Athanasius 296–373 becomes decisive because he forced the church to attend to what Scripture says about the Son in light of this Old Testament matrix. Confronting the Arian claim that the Son is a creature exalted above all others, he argued from the entire canon that the Son is truly God of God. His Orations against the Arians do not rest on metaphysical axioms but on sustained exegesis of John, Hebrews, and the Psalms. When faced with the Arian reading of Wisdom in Proverbs as created, Athanasius shows that Scripture uses the language of begetting for the Son’s relation to the Father and uses created of the works of Wisdom rather than of Wisdom’s divine essence. Psalm 110’s begotten language, the creative prerogatives of the Word in Psalm 33 and in Hebrews 1, and the attribution of worship to the Son all require that he be of one being with the Father. Athanasius’ hermeneutical claim is that Scripture itself compels a distinction of persons without division of the one God. He thus furnishes the crucial pattern for reading the Old Testament not as a rival to the New but as the first movement of a single symphony, and he knits together exegesis and dogma so that **eternal generation** becomes the biblically warranted name for what the texts impute to the Son: from the Father, not made, consubstantial.

Augustine 354–430 consolidates this synthesis with unparalleled rigor by explicating how the one essence is common to the three persons and how the economy of revelation discloses yet does not divide God. De Trinitate argues from Scripture that the operations of God ad extra are undivided. Father, Son, and Spirit work inseparably in creation, providence, and redemption, even as missions manifest the personal distinctions in a fitting way. He insists that the temporal sending of the Son and the Spirit corresponds to their eternal relations, the Son from the Father and the Spirit from the Father and the Son, so that missions reveal **eternal generation** and **procession** without implying subordination of essence or will. This yields the crucial exegetical rule of **inseparable operations** coupled with appropriations. When Scripture says the Father creates, the Son creates, and the Spirit creates, Augustine denies a partition of work. He argues instead that the one simple divine act is the work of all three, while Scripture appropriately attributes certain works to one person to manifest the relations of origin. This forestalls the examiner’s standard challenge: how do you avoid tritheism once you attribute personal operations? Augustine answers that the one divine will is numerically one because of **divine simplicity**; personhood does not carve the essence into thirds but names relations in the simple essence.

Crucially for our topic, Augustine also addresses the Old Testament theophanies. He holds that appearances of God in sight and sound are mediated by created signs, yet he grants that the Son fittingly appears because the Son is the Word by which all such appearances are ordered to reveal the Father. This protects transcendence without vacating the real self‑manifestation of God in the Angel of the Lord and the Glory. The implication is not that we can always identify the person appearing, but that the economy coheres with the immanent Trinity. When asked whether Genesis 18 or the burning bush proves the Son’s preincarnate visibility, the Augustinian answer is measured: the texts render a real divine self‑manifestation that, in the light of Christ, we can say is coordinated by the Word, but the central point is not to fix a face on every theophany; it is to confess the one God revealing himself through Word and Spirit toward the advent of the Son in the flesh.

The New Testament then turns the dimmer to full light, but not by changing gods. It retains Deuteronomic monotheism while placing Jesus and the Spirit within the unique divine identity. Triadic texts are not slogans but liturgical and missionary condensations of the canonical pattern. The baptismal Name is singular and threefold: baptizing into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The apostolic benediction places the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit together as a unitary blessing. The Son is confessed as Lord alongside the one God of Israel, as in the Shema’s reformulation in 1 Corinthians 8, where Paul identifies one God the Father from whom are all things and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things. This is not a slide into ditheism. It is a christological rereading of Israel’s confession that includes Jesus in God’s unique sovereignty over creation. Hebrews 1 attributes Psalm 102, which speaks of the Lord laying the foundation of the earth, to the Son, and commands angels to worship him. John’s prologue names the Word as God, who was with God, through whom all things were made, and who became flesh. John 5 and 10 present the Son as the one who does whatever the Father does and who receives the same honor as the Father. John 14 to 16 promises the Paraclete who is sent by the Father and the Son, who teaches, intercedes, and can be grieved, thus possessing personhood, and whose work is divine illumination and regeneration. Acts 5 equates lying to the Holy Spirit with lying to God. Romans 8 and Galatians 4 depict the Spirit as the Spirit of the Son and of the Father, leading and indwelling as only God does, sealing adoption and inaugurating new creation.

Richard Bauckham stands here as a contemporary decisive figure because he reframes the NT data in terms of divine identity rather than a bare predicate God. By showing how Second Temple Judaism distinguished the one God from all else by unique creator rule and exclusive worship, he tracks how the New Testament authors place Jesus and the Spirit on the Creator side of the line. The application of the Isaiah 40 to 55 divine prerogatives to Jesus, the doxologies to Father and Son and Spirit, and the ascription of worship to the Lamb in Revelation are not marginal embellishments. They are the apostolic confession that Jesus shares the unique identity of the God of Israel. This dismantles the frequent external objection that high Christology is a late development and that Jewish monotheism could not have borne it. It also reinforces that the Spirit’s personhood and deity are not linguistic accidents. The Spirit is the eschatological presence of God, poured out by the exalted Lord, who sanctifies the church as a temple, searches the depths of God, and apportions gifts sovereignly as he wills.

B. B. Warfield adds decisive methodological clarity. He notes that a Bible verse that says God is one in three and three in one would be a curiosity, not a proof. The doctrine arises from the convergence of the entire New Testament witness, which presupposes the deity of the Son and the Spirit everywhere without always defining it. Warfield’s memorable claim that the Old Testament is a chamber richly furnished but dimly lit, and that only with the coming of the Son and the outpouring of the Spirit is the light turned on, captures progressive revelation in a sentence. He insists that the Old Testament does not teach the Trinity in didactic form, but that it contains the structures, roles, and anticipations that the New Testament identifies with the persons. This is not retrospective eisegesis. It is the apostles’ own hermeneutic, authorized by the risen Lord who opened the Scriptures and showed how Moses and the Prophets speak of him and the promise of the Spirit. Warfield also anticipates a Westminster examiner’s probe about method: how do we avoid a circular appeal to dogma when reading Scripture? He answers by distinguishing the order of being and the order of knowing. Scripture’s manifold claims about Father, Son, and Spirit provide the data. Dogma is the church’s disciplined attempt to say what must be true of God if those data are true. The circle is not vicious; it is the virtuous circle of faith seeking understanding under the rule of Scripture.

The Reformed tradition extends these patristic and apostolic patterns with exegetical care, and John Owen is a decisive model. In his Pneumatologia and Communion with God, Owen argues from Scripture for the deity and personhood of the Spirit and for the church’s distinct fellowship with each person. He grounds the Spirit’s deity in divine titles, operations, worship, and attributes in the New Testament, precisely the criteria that the Old Testament had reserved for the Lord alone. The Spirit searches the depths of God, regenerates, sanctifies, gifts, and is lied to as God. Owen also insists that the Spirit’s mission reveals his **procession**, not as a temporal cause but as a biblical name for an eternal relation that eternally orders the persons without implying inferiority. He aligns mission and **federal theology** by showing that the economy of redemption under covenant is trinitarian through and through: the Father elects, the Son accomplishes, the Spirit applies. This is not a division of labor but a manifestation of **inseparable operations** with fitting appropriations. Owen’s devotional conclusion is exegetically grounded doxology: the benediction of 2 Corinthians 13 is not a flourish but the charter of Christian communion with the three persons.

Several internal debates require attention. First, what of reading the Trinity in the Old Testament? Some argue that apart from NT light, the OT yields only strict monotheism and personifications. The reply is to affirm both the integrity of the OT’s original discourse and the providence of inspiration that binds the canon. On its own terms, the OT presents Word and Spirit as divine agents in creation and salvation, the Angel of the Lord as identified with God and yet distinct, and ubiquitous hints of plurality within God’s self‑related life. Yet we do not claim the OT saints articulated a doctrine of three persons. With Warfield and Augustine, we say that God used types, names, and acts that the incarnation and Pentecost would disclose fully. The hermeneutical engine is the NT’s inspired rereading. That protects us against anachronism and against the opposite error of hermeneutical deism in which earlier texts are sealed off from Christ.

Second, is the Wisdom of Proverbs a person or a personification? On a purely literary level, the feminine figure is personified wisdom. The decisive question is canonical. Athanasius shows that the prerogatives ascribed to Wisdom in creation and counsel are ascribed to the Son and to the Spirit in the New Testament, while Proverbs 8’s language about being possessed or brought forth must be read in light of the entire canon to avoid attributing a beginning in time to the Son. Therefore, Wisdom is personification at the level of proverb and personalized in Christ at the level of fulfillment. This is the sensus plenior that the apostles themselves use when they identify Christ as the wisdom and power of God.

Third, do the missions entail subordination? Here Augustine and Owen are decisive. The Son’s obedience in the economy is the human obedience of the incarnate Son and the fitting expression of his eternal relation from the Father, not evidence of an eternal subordination of will. **Inseparable operations** and **divine simplicity** entail one will in God. To posit an eternal subordination of will is to introduce two wills in God and to undermine the unity of essence. The better biblical account grounds taxis in relations of origin. The Father sends the Son because the Son is from the Father. The Spirit is sent by Father and Son because he eternally proceeds from the Father and the Son. Thus we defend **eternal generation** and **procession** as biblical names for these relations, seen in the Johannine fromness and in the double mission of Spirit.

We must also answer external critiques. The Arian and Socinian claim that passages calling Jesus God are rare or ambiguous is belied by the cumulative force of the NT. Jesus creates, receives worship, forgives sins by right, commands the elements, identifies himself with the I am, and is addressed as the Lord in ways reserved for the God of Israel. Likewise, the Spirit’s deity is not a late metaphysical add‑on but required to account for conversion, adoption, and sanctification as divine acts. Unitarian or Islamic accusations of tritheism miss the Augustinian point that monotheism is preserved by confessing one essence and one will in God under **divine simplicity**, while personal distinctions are maintained by relations of origin and the economy of missions. The biblical names and patterns force this confession.

The contemporary debate over social trinitarianism reinforces the need to tether trinitarian claims to biblical bases. Proposals that construct three centers of consciousness risk tritheism and detach theology from the exegesis of missions and identity. The Bible speaks of one God, not an alliance of three beings. At the same time, reducing person to mere modes contradicts the New Testament’s coordinated personal addresses, intercessions, and sendings. The only biblically defensible path is the classical one: three persons, real relations, one essence, one will, with **inseparable operations** and mission‑procession alignment. This secures the gospel’s structure. Election by the Father is not arbitrary power but love; the Son’s atonement is not the pacifying of another god but the self‑offering of God the Son; the Spirit’s indwelling is not a created auxiliary but God himself as the down payment of the inheritance. Soteriology collapses without the Trinity.

How then to present the Old Testament data succinctly to the examiner pressing for textual grounding without overclaiming? We may trace five interlocking lines. First, monotheism is affirmed in texts like Deuteronomy 6, Isaiah 43 to 45, and 1 Kings 8. Second, God’s Word and Spirit are divine in operation: creation by Word and Spirit in Genesis 1 and Psalm 33, regeneration and new heart by the Spirit in Ezekiel, the Spirit poured out with divine prerogatives in Joel. Third, the Angel of the Lord bears God’s name and authority, is called God, receives worship, yet is distinguished from God in dialogues like Genesis 16 and Judges 13. Fourth, royal and priestly figures are elevated to share in God’s rule in ways that pressure monotheism toward a trinitarian resolution, as in Psalm 110 and Daniel 7. Fifth, the Name theology of Deuteronomy and the Temple witness foreshadow the Son as the perfect presence of God with us and the Spirit as God’s eschatological indwelling. Then turn to the New Testament, show how Jesus and the Spirit fill these patterns without erasing monotheism, and close with the triadic formulas as liturgical crystallizations.

Anticipated objections can be answered crisply within this frame. Does Deuteronomy 6 deny plurality? No, it denies rival deities and locates all divinity in Israel’s Lord, and the NT includes Jesus and the Spirit in that unique divinity. Are the New Testament writers inventing theology out of whole cloth? No, they reread Israel’s Scriptures, invoking Yahweh texts for Jesus and the Spirit, and they confess what the resurrected Lord taught them about the Father’s name. Does the lack of an explicit Old Testament trinitarian creed mean the Trinity is not biblical? No, God reveals himself historically; the doctrine names the reality that becomes clear when the Son comes and the Spirit is poured out.

Finally, the doctrine’s biblical basis must be integrated with adjacent loci. The doctrine of Scripture itself is implicated, for only with **analogical knowledge** do we rightly speak of God from accommodated revelation. Christology is inseparable because the Son’s person is the hinge of the canon. Pneumatology is essential because the Spirit’s personhood and deity guarantee that God acts in us as God. The covenant of grace is triune in origin and execution, a point Reformed theology captures in its **federal theology** of Father’s purpose, Son’s mediation, Spirit’s application. Ecclesiology is defined by trinitarian worship, and sacramental practice is governed by the one Name into which we are baptized. Apologetics must show that Christian monotheism is not compromised by triune confession but secured by it.

The position I defend, then, is that Scripture, read canonically and confessing **divine simplicity**, teaches that the one God eternally exists as Father, Son, and Spirit. The Old Testament provides real revelation of this triune life in seed through the patterns of Word, Wisdom, Spirit, the Angel of the Lord, and the Name, without producing a formal doctrine because the economy of salvation had not yet culminated. The New Testament, while vigorously maintaining the Shema, includes Jesus and the Spirit in the divine identity by assigning to them God’s prerogatives, names, and worship, and by presenting their missions as manifestations of **eternal generation** and **procession**. Athanasius, Augustine, Owen, Warfield, and Bauckham do not impose foreign metaphysics; they explicate what the texts require and defend the church against oscillations toward unitarianism or tritheism. If examiners press whether this is circular, I answer that the circle is that of Scripture’s own claims driving dogmatic clarification, and if they press for a single verse, I answer with the Name in Matthew 28, the benediction in 2 Corinthians 13, and the prologue of John, not as isolated proofs but as the mature fruit of the whole canon’s revelation of the God who is one and three. The Trinity is not a postbiblical burden; it is the Bible’s own way of naming the saving God.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Scripture reveals the one God in three persons, under **divine simplicity**, with **eternal generation**, **procession**, and **inseparable operations**; the OT gives real but veiled revelation through Word, Wisdom, Spirit, the Angel, and the Name, and the NT unveils Father, Son, and Spirit while preserving monotheism.
- Decisive figures:
  - Athanasius: exegetical defense of the Son’s deity and **eternal generation**, integrating OT patterns with NT witness against Arianism.
  - Augustine: expounds **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, missions revealing relations, careful account of OT theophanies.
  - John Owen: biblical case for the Spirit’s deity and person, mission reflecting **procession**, trinitarian shape of **covenant** and Christian communion.
  - B. B. Warfield: progressive revelation, OT dimly lit and NT illuminating, method for canonical synthesis.
  - Richard Bauckham: inclusion of Jesus and the Spirit in Israel’s unique divine identity; Yahweh texts applied to Christ.
- Debates:
  - Internal: legitimacy and limits of OT trinitarian readings, Wisdom as personification vs hypostasis, grounding **eternal generation** and **procession**, scope of **inseparable operations**.

  - Contemporary: social trinitarianism, EFS versus classical taxis, divine council interpretations, canonical hermeneutics versus atomistic proof‑texting.
- Defended position: Canonical progressive revelation warrants Nicene classical theism; the NT explicitly includes Jesus and the Spirit in the divine identity, and the OT genuinely prefigures this reality.
- Likely examiner questions and answers:
  - Where in the OT is the Trinity? In the patterned confluence of Word, Wisdom, Spirit, the Angel of the Lord, and divine prerogatives that the NT identifies with the Son and the Spirit.
  - How do you preserve monotheism? By **divine simplicity** and one will, with personal distinctions named by relations of origin and manifested in missions.
