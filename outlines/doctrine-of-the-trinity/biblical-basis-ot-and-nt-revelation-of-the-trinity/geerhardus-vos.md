# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos understood the **Trinity** as progressively revealed through the unfolding of **redemptive history**. He maintained that both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament** bear witness to the triune nature of God, with the doctrine reaching its fullness in the person and work of Christ and the outpouring of the Spirit. For Vos, the Trinity is organically rooted in the development of **biblical revelation**, not a later theological imposition.

- "The Old Testament contains the seeds of the doctrine of the Trinity, which come to full flower in the New Testament." (Biblical Theology, p. 128)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline" (article)
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Trinity" (article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Progressive Revelation of the Trinity**
    - The Old Testament provides foundational hints and anticipations of the Trinity.
    - The New Testament brings clarity and fullness to the doctrine through Christ and the Spirit.
    - Vos sees **revelation** as organically unfolding, not as abrupt innovation.
    - The unity of the testaments is maintained through the continuity of God’s self-disclosure.
    "The later revelation does not contradict the earlier, but brings out what was latent in it." (Biblical Theology, p. 23)

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - The person and work of Christ reveal the distinct persons within the Godhead.
    - Jesus’ relationship to the Father and the sending of the Spirit are central to NT Trinitarian revelation.
    - Vos highlights the Gospels as the locus of explicit Trinitarian teaching.
    - The **incarnation** is the historical climax of Trinitarian revelation.
    "The revelation of the Trinity is inseparably connected with the revelation of the Mediator." (Biblical Theology, p. 317)

3. **Old Testament Anticipation**
    - The Old Testament contains plural references to God (e.g., Genesis 1:26; Isaiah 48:16).
    - The Angel of the Lord and the Spirit are seen as distinct yet divine.
    - Vos interprets these as preparatory, not accidental, for later Trinitarian doctrine.
    - He insists on reading the OT in light of its fulfillment in Christ.
    "The Old Testament is not silent about distinctions within the Godhead, though it speaks in veiled terms." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1, p. 99)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Method**
    - Vos insists that doctrine must be grounded in the unfolding history of redemption.
    - The Trinity is revealed in the acts of God, not merely in abstract propositions.
    - The pattern of revelation is historical, culminating in the NT.
    - This method safeguards against both rationalism and mysticism.
    "Revelation is not a deposit of truths, but a living process in history." (Biblical Theology, p. 5)

5. **Scriptural Authority and Unity**
    - Vos upholds the authority of both OT and NT as the unified Word of God.
    - He rejects any dichotomy between the testaments regarding the doctrine of God.
    - The **Trinity** is not a post-biblical construct but is embedded in the canonical witness.
    - The unity of Scripture is essential for a robust Trinitarian theology.
    "The doctrine of the Trinity is not superimposed upon Scripture, but grows out of its very heart." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1, p. 102)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s redemptive-historical approach deeply influenced Reformed understandings of the **Trinity** as biblically grounded and organically revealed. His insistence on the unity of **Old and New Testament revelation** shaped generations of biblical theologians, especially at Westminster Theological Seminary. Vos’s work remains foundational for those seeking to root systematic theology in the unfolding drama of Scripture, ensuring that the doctrine of the Trinity is seen as both exegetically warranted and central to the Christian faith.
