# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas affirms that the **doctrine of the Trinity** is revealed in both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament**, though the fullness of this mystery is made manifest only in the latter. He maintains that while the **unity of God** is clearly taught in the Old Testament, the **distinction of Persons** becomes explicit through the revelation of **Christ** and the **apostolic witness**. Aquinas insists that the biblical witness, when read in light of the Church’s tradition, provides a firm foundation for the doctrine of the Trinity.

- "The Old Testament suggested the mystery of the Trinity, but the New Testament clearly reveals it." (Summa Theologiae I, q.32, a.1)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Progressive Revelation of the Trinity**
    - The **unity of God** is the primary emphasis in the Old Testament, with hints of plurality.
    - The **distinction of Persons** is more fully disclosed in the New Testament.
    - Aquinas sees **typological** and **veiled references** to the Trinity in the Old Testament (e.g., Genesis 1:26; Isaiah 6:3).
    - The **New Testament** provides explicit testimony to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, especially in the baptismal formula and Christ’s teaching.
    - "In the Old Testament, the Trinity is foreshadowed; in the New, it is openly proclaimed." (Summa Theologiae I, q.32, a.1)

2. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Aquinas grounds the doctrine in **biblical texts**, not merely philosophical speculation.
    - He appeals to **Christ’s baptism** (Matthew 3:16–17) and the **Great Commission** (Matthew 28:19) as clear New Testament evidence.
    - Old Testament passages are interpreted in light of the fuller New Testament revelation.
    - He insists that **Scripture** is the ultimate authority for Trinitarian doctrine, though clarified by reason and tradition.
    - "We must believe in the Trinity on the authority of the New Testament, which reveals what was hidden in the Old." (Summa Contra Gentiles IV, ch. 2)

3. **Analogy and Appropriation in Trinitarian Exegesis**
    - Aquinas uses **analogy** to explain how scriptural language about God can refer to distinct Persons without implying division.
    - He employs the concept of **appropriation**, attributing certain works or names to one Person for pedagogical clarity.
    - Old Testament theophanies and plural references are interpreted as **preparatory** for the full revelation of the Trinity.
    - He cautions against reading later doctrinal clarity back into ambiguous Old Testament texts.
    - "Certain things are appropriated to the Persons, not because they belong to them alone, but to manifest the distinction." (Summa Theologiae I, q.39, a.7)

4. **Rationality and Mystery in Trinitarian Faith**
    - Aquinas affirms that the Trinity is a **mystery of faith** beyond unaided reason, yet not contrary to reason.
    - He argues that reason can show the **non-contradictory** nature of the doctrine, though not its full content.
    - The **biblical revelation** is necessary for knowledge of the Trinity; philosophy alone cannot attain it.
    - He upholds the **coherence** of biblical testimony with rational reflection, integrating faith and reason.
    - "That God is triune is known only by revelation, not by natural reason." (Summa Theologiae I, q.32, a.1)

5. **Role of the Church and Tradition in Interpretation**
    - Aquinas maintains that the **Church’s creeds** and tradition guide the proper reading of Scripture regarding the Trinity.
    - He sees the **patristic consensus** as confirming the biblical witness to the triune God.
    - The Church’s doctrinal formulations serve to **safeguard** the biblical teaching from heretical misinterpretation.
    - He insists that the **biblical basis** for the Trinity is clarified and defended through the Church’s teaching office.
    - "The Church, instructed by the Holy Spirit, has faithfully handed down the doctrine of the Trinity drawn from Scripture." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s careful articulation of the **biblical basis for the Trinity** has profoundly shaped both Roman Catholic and broader Christian theology. His integration of **Scripture**, **reason**, and **tradition** set a standard for subsequent Trinitarian reflection. Later theologians have drawn on his exegetical methods and philosophical clarity to defend the doctrine against both ancient and modern challenges. Aquinas remains a central figure in discussions of how the Old and New Testaments together witness to the triune nature of God.
