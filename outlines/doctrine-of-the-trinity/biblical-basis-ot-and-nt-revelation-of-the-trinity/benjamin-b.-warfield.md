# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield argued that the **doctrine of the Trinity** is firmly rooted in both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament**, though it is only fully revealed in the latter. He maintained that the **unity and plurality** of the Godhead are progressively disclosed, with the **Trinitarian structure** of divine revelation becoming explicit in the person and work of Christ and the apostolic witness. Warfield emphasized that the **biblical basis** for the Trinity is not the result of speculative theology but arises organically from the scriptural witness.

- "The Old Testament was written before this revelation was made, and it contains no suggestions of it; but the New Testament is saturated with it from beginning to end." (The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity)

## Key Works

- "The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Person and Work of Christ"
- "The Revelation of God in Scripture"
- "The Idea of Systematic Theology"
- Selected articles in The Presbyterian and Reformed Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Progressive Revelation of the Trinity**
   - The **Old Testament** contains hints and anticipations of plurality within the Godhead.
   - The **New Testament** provides the full unveiling of the **Trinitarian** nature of God.
   - Warfield sees the doctrine as "latent" in the Old and "patent" in the New.
   - He insists that the Trinity is not imposed on Scripture but emerges from its unfolding narrative.
   - "The Old Testament may be likened to a chamber richly furnished but dimly lighted." ("The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity")

2. **Scriptural Foundation over Speculation**
   - Warfield rejects extra-biblical philosophical speculation as the basis for the Trinity.
   - He grounds the doctrine in the exegesis of **biblical texts**.
   - The **Trinitarian formula** (e.g., Matthew 28:19) is central to his argument.
   - He highlights the organic connection between **revelation** and **doctrine**.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a speculative doctrine, but a summary of the scriptural teaching." ("The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity")

3. **Unity and Distinction in the Godhead**
   - Warfield affirms the **unity of essence** and **distinction of persons** within the Godhead.
   - He shows that both unity and plurality are present in the biblical witness.
   - The **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** are co-equal and co-eternal.
   - He resists both modalism and tritheism as unbiblical distortions.
   - "There is but one God, but in the unity of the Godhead there are three coequal and coeternal persons." ("The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity")

4. **Christological Center of Revelation**
   - The person and work of **Jesus Christ** are pivotal for the disclosure of the Trinity.
   - The incarnation and the sending of the Spirit reveal the inner life of God.
   - Warfield highlights the **apostolic witness** to Christ’s divinity and the Spirit’s personhood.
   - The **Trinitarian pattern** is especially clear in the New Testament epistles.
   - "It was through what Christ was and did that men came to know God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." ("The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity")

5. **Continuity with Historic Orthodoxy**
   - Warfield aligns his doctrine with the **Nicene Creed** and historic confessions.
   - He sees the creedal formulations as faithful summaries of biblical teaching.
   - The **Reformed tradition** is presented as upholding the scriptural Trinity.
   - He defends the doctrine against both modernist and anti-Trinitarian critiques.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity belongs to the very heart of the Christian faith." ("The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **biblical doctrine of the Trinity** has shaped Reformed and evangelical theology, especially in its insistence on the primacy of Scripture for doctrinal formulation. His articulation of **progressive revelation** and the organic unity of the Old and New Testaments continues to influence systematic theology and biblical studies. Warfield’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to ground the doctrine of the Trinity in the **exegetical and redemptive-historical** witness of Scripture.
