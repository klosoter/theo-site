# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirms the **Trinity** as a doctrine revealed progressively in both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament**, insisting that the unity and distinction of the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** are rooted in the biblical witness. He maintains that the **divinity of Christ** and the **personhood of the Spirit** are not later theological inventions but are grounded in the **Scriptures** themselves, even if more clearly disclosed in the New Testament.

- "Scripture, moreover, clearly distinguishes the Father from the Word, and the Word from the Spirit." (Institutes I.13.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 13–14)
- Commentaries on Genesis, Isaiah, and Psalms
- Commentary on the Gospel of John
- Sermons on Deuteronomy
- The Bondage and Liberation of the Will

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Divine Essence**
    - Asserts that **God is one in essence**, with no division in substance.
    - The Old Testament affirms the oneness of God, which is foundational for understanding the Trinity.
    - Emphasizes that the three persons do not undermine the unity of God.
    - The divine essence is fully possessed by the Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - "We, indeed, say that the persons are distinct, not divided, but distinguished among themselves by their peculiar properties." (Institutes I.13.6)

2. **Progressive Revelation of the Trinity**
    - The Old Testament contains **shadows and hints** of the Trinity, such as plural references to God.
    - The New Testament brings **fuller clarity** to the distinctions among the persons.
    - Calvin sees continuity between the testaments, not contradiction.
    - The doctrine is not imposed on Scripture but drawn from its unfolding narrative.
    - "The Old Testament gives not so clear an exhibition of the three persons as the New." (Institutes I.13.8)

3. **Biblical Foundation for the Deity of Christ**
    - Affirms that Christ’s divinity is evident in both testaments.
    - Old Testament theophanies and titles point to the pre-incarnate Son.
    - New Testament passages explicitly identify Christ as God.
    - The Son is eternally begotten, not created.
    - "The Son is called God, and his eternity is clearly declared." (Institutes I.13.9)

4. **Personhood and Deity of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit is not a mere force but a distinct person within the Godhead.
    - Old Testament references to the Spirit’s work are foundational.
    - New Testament teaching on the Spirit’s role in redemption and sanctification is decisive.
    - The Spirit is worshiped and glorified together with the Father and the Son.
    - "The Spirit is truly God, and yet is distinct from the Father and the Son." (Institutes I.13.14)

5. **Scripture as the Norm for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Rejects speculative philosophy in favor of **biblical testimony**.
    - Insists that all Trinitarian language must be governed by Scripture.
    - The church’s creedal formulations are valuable insofar as they reflect the biblical witness.
    - The mystery of the Trinity is to be received in humility, not rationalized away.
    - "Let us, therefore, willingly leave to God the knowledge of himself." (Institutes I.13.21)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust articulation of the **biblical basis for the Trinity** shaped Reformed confessions and catechisms, grounding the doctrine in both Old and New Testament revelation. His exegetical method, emphasizing the unity of Scripture and the progressive clarity of **Trinitarian revelation**, influenced generations of theologians and pastors. Calvin’s insistence on the sufficiency of Scripture for doctrinal formulation remains a hallmark of Reformed theology, ensuring that the doctrine of the Trinity is seen as both a mystery and a revealed truth.
