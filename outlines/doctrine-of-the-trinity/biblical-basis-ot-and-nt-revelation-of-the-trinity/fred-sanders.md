# Fred Sanders (1968– )

Fred Sanders emphasizes that the **doctrine of the Trinity** is deeply rooted in both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament** revelation, insisting that the full disclosure of the triune God is a uniquely Christian reading of Scripture. He argues that while the **Trinity** is most clearly revealed in the **incarnation** and **Pentecost**, the **unity and distinction** of the divine persons is anticipated in the Old Testament and made explicit in the New. Sanders maintains that the biblical witness is foundational for all **systematic formulations** of the Trinity.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Primary Witness to the Trinity**
    - The **Trinity** is revealed through the progressive narrative of the entire Bible.
    - Both **Testaments** contribute to the full disclosure of the triune God.
    - The **New Testament** provides the clearest articulation, but the **Old Testament** contains real anticipations.
    - The **biblical canon** is the authoritative source for trinitarian doctrine.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not deduced from a few proof texts but is the result of reading the whole Bible as a unified witness." (The Deep Things of God)

2. **Old Testament Hints and Patterns**
    - The Old Testament contains **patterns, types, and hints** of plurality within the Godhead.
    - Passages such as Genesis 1:26 and Isaiah 48:16 are seen as anticipatory.
    - The **Angel of the Lord** and **Spirit of God** motifs foreshadow later revelation.
    - These patterns are only fully understood retrospectively, in light of Christ.
    - "The Old Testament is full of clues and patterns that only make sense once the Trinity is revealed in Christ." (The Triune God)

3. **New Testament Clarity and Fulfillment**
    - The **incarnation** and **sending of the Spirit** bring the Trinity into focus.
    - Key texts (e.g., Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14) explicitly name the three persons.
    - The **apostolic witness** interprets Jesus’ identity and mission in trinitarian terms.
    - The **New Testament** provides the vocabulary and framework for later doctrinal development.
    - "The New Testament is the place where the Trinity is made manifest, not invented." (The Deep Things of God)

4. **Reading Scripture with Trinitarian Eyes**
    - Christian readers are called to interpret Scripture in light of the **Trinity**.
    - The **rule of faith** guides the church in recognizing trinitarian patterns.
    - The **unity of Scripture** means that both Testaments are read together.
    - Trinitarian interpretation is not imposed but arises from the text’s own logic.
    - "We read the Bible as Christians, and that means reading it with the Trinity in view." (How to Read the Bible and See the Trinity)

5. **Biblical Revelation Grounds Systematic Theology**
    - All **systematic formulations** of the Trinity must be accountable to Scripture.
    - The **economic Trinity** (God’s actions in history) reveals the **immanent Trinity** (God’s eternal being).
    - The biblical narrative provides the grammar for doctrinal articulation.
    - The **Trinity** is not a speculative doctrine but a revealed mystery.
    - "Systematic theology must always return to the biblical witness as its source and norm." (The Triune God)

## Legacy and Impact

Fred Sanders has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical understanding of the **biblical basis of the Trinity**, emphasizing the continuity between **biblical revelation** and doctrinal formulation. His work has encouraged renewed attention to the **unity of Scripture** and the importance of reading both Testaments in light of the triune God. Sanders’ accessible yet rigorous approach has influenced pastors, scholars, and lay readers, helping to recover the centrality of the Trinity for Christian faith and practice.
