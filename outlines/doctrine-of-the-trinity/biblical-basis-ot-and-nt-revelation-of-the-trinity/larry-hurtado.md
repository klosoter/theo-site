# Larry Hurtado (1943–2019)

Larry Hurtado argued that the **New Testament** reveals a distinctive **devotional pattern** toward Jesus that is rooted in **Second Temple Jewish monotheism** yet signals a profound **revelatory shift**. He maintained that the **Trinitarian** understanding of God emerges from the earliest Christian worship and scriptural interpretation, rather than from later theological imposition, and that the **Old Testament** provides the essential monotheistic framework into which Jesus is uniquely included.

- "The origins of the worship of Jesus are to be found in the earliest circles of the Jesus movement, not as a later, gentile, or pagan development." (Lord Jesus Christ, p. 3)

- At the Origins of Christian Worship (1999)
- Honoring the Son: Jesus in Earliest Christian Devotional Practice (2018)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Jewish Monotheism as the Matrix**
    - Early Christian beliefs about Jesus are rooted in the **monotheistic** convictions of the **Old Testament**.
    - The **Shema** and other OT affirmations of one God are not abandoned but reinterpreted in light of Jesus.
    - The inclusion of Jesus in worship is seen as a remarkable development within a **strictly monotheistic** context.
    - Hurtado emphasizes the continuity and transformation of **Jewish revelation** in the NT.
    - "The earliest Christians did not see themselves as abandoning Jewish monotheism but as expressing it in a new way." (One God, One Lord, p. 98)

2. **Early Devotional Practice as Evidence**
    - The **worship of Jesus** in prayer, hymn, and confession is attested in the earliest NT documents.
    - Such devotion is not a late innovation but appears within decades of Jesus’ death.
    - This practice signals a **revelatory shift** in the understanding of God’s identity.
    - Hurtado argues that this worship is the seedbed of later **Trinitarian** doctrine.
    - "The place of Jesus in early Christian devotional practice is unparalleled in the religious environment of the time." (Lord Jesus Christ, p. 2)

3. **Revelation of Jesus’ Divine Status**
    - The NT presents Jesus as sharing in **divine prerogatives** (e.g., receiving worship, the divine name).
    - NT texts (e.g., Philippians 2, Revelation) reveal a **high Christology** from the earliest stages.
    - Jesus is depicted as the unique agent of **God’s revelation** and redemptive work.
    - Hurtado sees this as a development of **OT revelation**, not a contradiction.
    - "Jesus is reverenced as uniquely linked with God, yet distinguished from God." (How on Earth Did Jesus Become a God?, p. 53)

4. **Scriptural Reinterpretation in Light of Christ**
    - Early Christians reread the **Old Testament** in light of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.
    - OT texts are applied to Jesus, identifying him with **YHWH** in certain contexts.
    - This hermeneutic is foundational for the NT’s **Trinitarian** implications.
    - Hurtado highlights the creative, yet reverent, use of Scripture in early Christian communities.
    - "The earliest Christian texts show a remarkable readiness to apply OT passages about God to Jesus." (Lord Jesus Christ, p. 613)

5. **Trinitarian Impulse Precedes Formal Doctrine**
    - The NT does not present a fully articulated **doctrine of the Trinity**, but its **revelation** is implicit in worship and confession.
    - The **Father, Son, and Spirit** are regularly associated in NT formulas (e.g., baptism, benedictions).
    - Hurtado contends that the **Trinitarian pattern** is a natural outgrowth of early Christian experience and revelation.
    - Later creedal formulations codify what was already present in **NT revelation** and practice.
    - "The roots of later Trinitarian doctrine are to be found in the devotional and confessional patterns of the earliest Christians." (Honoring the Son, p. 45)

## Legacy and Impact

Hurtado’s scholarship has profoundly shaped the study of **early Christian devotion** and the **biblical basis** for the Trinity. By situating the NT’s presentation of Jesus within the context of **Jewish monotheism**, he challenged older evolutionary models of Christology and highlighted the continuity between **Old and New Testament revelation**. His work remains a touchstone for understanding how the **Trinitarian** pattern arose from the earliest Christian experience and scriptural interpretation. Hurtado’s careful historical and exegetical method continues to influence both academic and confessional discussions of the doctrine of the Trinity.
