# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the **biblical revelation of the Trinity** by emphasizing the continuity between the **economic Trinity** revealed in salvation history and the **immanent Trinity** of God's eternal being. He argued that both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament** provide the foundation for Trinitarian doctrine, though the full articulation emerges only in the light of Christ and the apostolic witness. Rahner’s hallmark is his insistence that the **self-communication of God** in history is the true basis for understanding the Trinity.

- "The 'economic' Trinity is the 'immanent' Trinity and the 'immanent' Trinity is the 'economic' Trinity." (The Trinity)

## Key Works

- The Trinity (1970)
- Foundations of Christian Faith (1976)
- Hearers of the Word (1941)
- Theological Investigations, Vol. I–IV (esp. essays on revelation and Trinity)
- "Remarks on the Dogmatic Treatise 'De Trinitate'" (Theological Investigations I)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuity of Economic and Immanent Trinity**
    - The revelation of God in **salvation history** (economy) is identical with God’s eternal triune being.
    - The biblical witness, especially in the NT, reveals the Trinity through the actions of **Father, Son, and Spirit**.
    - There is no hidden God behind the God revealed in Scripture.
    - The **self-communication** of God is the basis for all Trinitarian knowledge.
    - "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and vice versa." (The Trinity)

2. **Progressive Revelation in Scripture**
    - The OT contains **preparatory forms** and hints of Trinitarian revelation, especially in God’s Word and Spirit.
    - The NT provides the decisive witness to the **Trinitarian structure** of God’s self-revelation.
    - Full Trinitarian doctrine is not explicit in the OT but is rooted in its witness.
    - The NT’s presentation of Jesus and the Spirit is the culmination of biblical revelation.
    - "The New Testament is the decisive witness for the doctrine of the Trinity." (The Trinity)

3. **Christocentric Focus**
    - The revelation of the Trinity is inseparable from the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ is the definitive self-expression of God in history.
    - The NT’s testimony to Christ’s divinity and the sending of the Spirit grounds Trinitarian belief.
    - The **incarnation** is the key event in the biblical unveiling of the Trinity.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is a theological articulation of the experience of salvation in Christ." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Pneumatological Emphasis**
    - The Holy Spirit’s presence and activity are central to the NT’s Trinitarian witness.
    - The Spirit is not a mere force but a divine person revealed in the life of the church.
    - The Spirit’s role in revelation and sanctification is essential for understanding the Trinity.
    - The NT’s language about the Spirit complements and completes the Trinitarian pattern.
    - "The Spirit is the mode in which God is present and active in the world." (The Trinity)

5. **Anthropological Orientation**
    - Human experience of God’s self-communication is the starting point for understanding biblical revelation.
    - The Trinity is not an abstract doctrine but the structure of God’s relationship with humanity.
    - The biblical narrative is interpreted through the lens of **God’s self-gift** to humanity.
    - The doctrine of the Trinity arises from the lived encounter with God in history.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the expression of the Christian experience of God’s self-communication." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s approach to the **biblical basis of the Trinity** has shaped modern Catholic and ecumenical theology, especially through his famous "Rahner’s Rule" on the identity of the economic and immanent Trinity. His insistence on grounding Trinitarian doctrine in **biblical revelation** and salvation history has encouraged renewed engagement with Scripture in systematic theology. Rahner’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of the Trinity, revelation, and the relationship between doctrine and experience.
