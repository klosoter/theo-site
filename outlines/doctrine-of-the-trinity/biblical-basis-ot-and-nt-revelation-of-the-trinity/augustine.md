# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine developed a profound and influential doctrine of the **Trinity**, grounding his understanding in both **Old Testament theophanies** and the **New Testament revelation** of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He emphasized the unity of the divine essence while distinguishing the three **persons** through their relations, insisting that the **Scriptures** progressively unveil the triune nature of God, culminating in the clarity of the New Testament.

- "In the Old Testament the New is concealed, in the New the Old is revealed." (De Catechizandis Rudibus)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Confessiones (Confessions)
- Enarrationes in Psalmos (Expositions on the Psalms)
- De Doctrina Christiana (On Christian Doctrine)
- Sermones (Sermons)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Progressive Revelation of the Trinity**
    - The **Trinity** is present in the Old Testament in veiled forms and types.
    - Full clarity about the three persons emerges only in the New Testament.
    - Augustine interprets OT theophanies as hints of the triune God.
    - He sees the NT as the definitive disclosure of the Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - "The Old Testament is the New Testament concealed; the New Testament is the Old Testament revealed." (De Catechizandis Rudibus)

2. **Unity of Essence, Distinction of Persons**
    - God is one **substance** or essence, shared equally by Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The three persons are distinguished by their relations, not by essence or degree.
    - Scriptural revelation affirms both unity and distinction without contradiction.
    - Augustine uses analogies (e.g., mind, knowledge, love) to illustrate this unity-in-distinction.
    - "They are each one, not three gods but one God, because they are of one substance." (De Trinitate I.7)

3. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Augustine appeals to both OT and NT texts to support the doctrine.
    - He reads Genesis 1:26 ("Let us make man") as a plural hint of the Trinity.
    - NT passages (e.g., Matthew 28:19; John 1:1-18) are central to his argument.
    - He insists that the doctrine is not a philosophical imposition but a biblical truth.
    - "We believe in the Trinity, not because we have invented it, but because we have read it in the Scriptures." (De Trinitate I.4)

4. **Economic and Immanent Trinity**
    - Augustine distinguishes between the **immanent Trinity** (God in himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s actions in history).
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit in redemption reveal eternal relations.
    - OT appearances (e.g., the Angel of the Lord) are interpreted as temporary manifestations, not incarnations.
    - The NT clarifies the sending of the Son and Spirit as rooted in eternal processions.
    - "The sending of the Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit reveal what is eternal in God." (De Trinitate II.9)

5. **Use of Analogies to Illuminate Mystery**
    - Augustine employs psychological analogies (memory, understanding, will) to reflect the Trinity.
    - These analogies are drawn from Scripture’s own language about humanity as God’s image.
    - He warns that all analogies are limited and cannot fully capture divine mystery.
    - The analogies serve to show the reasonableness, not the comprehensibility, of the doctrine.
    - "If you see charity, you see the Trinity." (De Trinitate VIII.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **biblical basis for the Trinity** shaped Western theology’s approach to both exegesis and doctrinal formulation. His insistence on the unity of essence and distinction of persons became foundational for later **Reformed** and Catholic thought. Augustine’s careful reading of both Old and New Testaments as progressively revealing the triune God remains a touchstone for systematic theology, and his analogical method continues to influence theological reflection on the mystery of the Trinity.
