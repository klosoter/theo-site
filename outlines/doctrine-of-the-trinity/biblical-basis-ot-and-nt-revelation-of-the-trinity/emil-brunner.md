# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **doctrine of the Trinity** by emphasizing the existential encounter with **divine revelation** rather than a systematic metaphysical formulation. He acknowledged the presence of **Trinitarian patterns** in both the Old and New Testaments but argued that the full doctrine emerges only in the light of the **Christ-event** and the **self-disclosure of God** in Jesus Christ. Brunner was critical of speculative Trinitarianism, insisting that the biblical witness points primarily to the **personal God** revealed in history.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a speculative construction, but the expression of the fact that God reveals Himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Truth as Encounter
- The Divine-Human Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Personal and Historical**
    - God’s self-disclosure occurs in concrete historical events, not abstract propositions.
    - The **Trinity** is known through God’s acts in history, especially in Christ.
    - The Old Testament anticipates but does not articulate the Trinity.
    - The New Testament reveals the triune God through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
    - "God reveals Himself as He is, not in abstract ideas, but in His acts in history." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Christocentric Focus of Trinitarian Revelation**
    - The person and work of Jesus Christ are central to understanding God’s triune nature.
    - The New Testament’s witness to Christ’s divinity and the sending of the Spirit grounds Trinitarian belief.
    - The doctrine of the Trinity arises from reflection on the Christ-event.
    - The unity and distinction within the Godhead are revealed in the mission of the Son and Spirit.
    - "It is only in the light of Christ that we can speak of God as Trinity." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

3. **Critical Reception of Classical Trinitarian Formulations**
    - Brunner critiques speculative and metaphysical approaches to the Trinity.
    - He insists that biblical revelation, not philosophical categories, should shape Trinitarian doctrine.
    - The early church’s formulations are valuable but must be tested by Scripture.
    - The doctrine must remain rooted in the biblical witness to God’s self-revelation.
    - "The dogma of the Trinity must be derived from the biblical revelation, not from philosophical speculation." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity between OT and NT**
    - The Old Testament reveals the one God but contains hints of plurality (e.g., Spirit, Wisdom).
    - The New Testament clarifies and fulfills these hints in the revelation of Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - There is both continuity (one God) and discontinuity (full Trinitarian revelation) between the Testaments.
    - The doctrine of the Trinity is not imposed on Scripture but arises from its witness.
    - "The Old Testament prepares for, but does not contain, the doctrine of the Trinity; it is the New Testament which brings it to light." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

5. **Existential Encounter with the Triune God**
    - Knowledge of the Trinity is not merely intellectual but involves personal encounter.
    - Faith is response to God’s self-revelation as Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The Trinity is experienced in the life of the church and the believer.
    - The doctrine expresses the relational nature of God’s being and action.
    - "The Trinity is not a theory about God, but the way in which God meets us and saves us." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to the **biblical basis of the Trinity** influenced modern theology by emphasizing the existential and historical dimensions of **revelation** over speculative metaphysics. His insistence on rooting Trinitarian doctrine in the **biblical witness** challenged both liberal reductionism and overly abstract orthodoxy. While sometimes criticized for underplaying the ontological aspects of the Trinity, Brunner’s work remains significant for those seeking a Christ-centered, scripturally grounded understanding of the triune God.
