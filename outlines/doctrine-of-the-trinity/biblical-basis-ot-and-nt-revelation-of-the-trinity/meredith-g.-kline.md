# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the **biblical doctrine of the Trinity** by emphasizing the organic unity of **Old and New Testament revelation**. He argued that the **covenantal structure** of Scripture provides a framework for understanding the progressive unveiling of the **Triune God**, with **theophany** and **divine agency** in the Old Testament anticipating the fuller revelation in the New Testament.

- "The Old Testament theophanies are not merely anticipations but actual revelations of the divine persons." (Images of the Spirit)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenantal Revelation of the Trinity**
    - The **Trinity** is progressively revealed through the unfolding of the **covenant** in redemptive history.
    - Old Testament covenants contain implicit references to **divine plurality**.
    - The New Testament clarifies and fulfills the covenantal hints of **Father, Son, and Spirit**.
    - The unity of the covenantal narrative underscores the continuity of **Trinitarian revelation**.
    - "The covenantal structure of Scripture is itself a revelation of the triune God." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Theophany as Trinitarian Disclosure**
    - Old Testament **theophanies** are appearances of the divine persons, not merely generic manifestations.
    - The **Angel of the Lord** is interpreted as a pre-incarnate appearance of the Son.
    - The **Spirit** is active in creation, prophecy, and empowerment, foreshadowing New Testament roles.
    - Theophanic events point to the interpersonal relationships within the Godhead.
    - "The theophanic Glory is the visible revelation of the triune presence." (Images of the Spirit)

3. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Progression**
    - **Typology** in the Old Testament anticipates the full revelation of the Trinity in Christ and Pentecost.
    - Key figures and events (e.g., Moses, Exodus, tabernacle) serve as types of the **Son** and **Spirit**.
    - The **redemptive-historical method** highlights the organic development of Trinitarian doctrine.
    - The New Testament interprets Old Testament types as fulfilled in the **Triune God’s** work.
    - "Typology is the Spirit’s own method of revealing the deeper realities of the Godhead." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Divine Agency and Plurality in the Old Testament**
    - Old Testament texts use plural language (e.g., "Let us make man") to hint at **divine plurality**.
    - The distinction between **Yahweh** and the **Angel of Yahweh** suggests intra-divine relationships.
    - The **Spirit of God** is depicted as a distinct agent in creation and prophecy.
    - These patterns prepare for the explicit Trinitarian teaching of the New Testament.
    - "The Old Testament’s divine agents are not mere functions but persons within the Godhead." (Images of the Spirit)

5. **Christological Fulfillment and Pneumatological Consummation**
    - The incarnation of the **Son** and the outpouring of the **Spirit** are the climax of Trinitarian revelation.
    - Jesus’ baptism and transfiguration reveal the **Father, Son, and Spirit** together.
    - Pentecost marks the eschatological arrival of the Spirit, fulfilling Old Testament promises.
    - The New Testament’s explicit Trinitarian formulas are rooted in Old Testament patterns.
    - "The New Testament’s Trinitarian witness is the consummation of the Old Testament’s anticipations." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s work has shaped contemporary **Reformed biblical theology** by insisting on the organic unity of **Trinitarian revelation** across both Testaments. His emphasis on **covenantal structure** and theophany has influenced how scholars trace the development of the doctrine of the Trinity from Genesis to Revelation. Kline’s typological and redemptive-historical approach continues to inform exegetical and theological discussions on the biblical basis for the Trinity.
