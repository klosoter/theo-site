# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth approached the **biblical revelation of the Trinity** by emphasizing the self-disclosure of God in both the **Old and New Testaments**, culminating in the person of **Jesus Christ**. For Barth, the doctrine of the **Trinity** is not a speculative construct but arises from the **biblical witness** to God's one essence in three modes of being, revealed supremely in the history of salvation.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is what basically distinguishes the Christian doctrine of God as Christian." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Church Dogmatics I/2: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Church Dogmatics II/1: The Doctrine of God
- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- The Göttingen Dogmatics

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Basis for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - The **Trinity** is known only because God has revealed Himself as such in Scripture.
    - Both **Old and New Testaments** are unified in their witness to the one God who reveals Himself in threefold form.
    - The **self-revelation** of God is actualized in the history of Israel and fulfilled in Christ.
    - Barth rejects natural theology as a source for knowledge of the Trinity.
    - "We have to do with the doctrine of the Trinity only because it is given with the revelation of God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Christocentric Reading of Scripture**
    - The **incarnation** of the Son is the central event in which the triune God is made known.
    - The **New Testament** explicitly names Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the context of salvation.
    - The **Old Testament** is read in light of Christ, revealing anticipatory forms of Trinitarian revelation.
    - All biblical revelation is oriented toward the person and work of Jesus Christ.
    - "In Jesus Christ God reveals Himself as the Lord, the One who loves in freedom." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

3. **Unity and Distinction in the Godhead**
    - God is one in **essence** but exists in three distinct **modes of being** (Seinsweisen).
    - The biblical narrative presents God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit acting in unity.
    - The distinctions are not three gods but three ways in which the one God is revealed.
    - Barth uses biblical language to safeguard both unity and distinction.
    - "God reveals Himself. He reveals Himself through Himself. He reveals Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

4. **Scriptural Economy of Revelation**
    - The **economy of salvation** in Scripture is the arena in which the Trinity is made manifest.
    - The **baptism of Jesus** and the apostolic benedictions are key New Testament texts for Trinitarian doctrine.
    - The Old Testament prepares for and anticipates the fuller Trinitarian revelation in the New.
    - Barth insists that the doctrine must arise from the biblical narrative, not from abstract speculation.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is grounded in the biblical witness to the acts of God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

5. **Rejection of Speculative Trinitarianism**
    - Barth opposes any formulation of the Trinity not rooted in **biblical revelation**.
    - He critiques traditional metaphysical approaches that go beyond the scriptural witness.
    - The doctrine is always subordinate to and derived from the **Word of God**.
    - Barth insists on the priority of **exegesis** over philosophical categories.
    - "We must not construct the Trinity out of our own thoughts, but let it arise from the biblical revelation." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s approach to the **biblical basis of the Trinity** reinvigorated modern Trinitarian theology by insisting on the primacy of **revelation** and the centrality of **Christ** in both Testaments. His rejection of natural theology and speculative metaphysics shifted the focus of Trinitarian doctrine back to the **biblical narrative**. Barth’s influence is seen in contemporary discussions of the **economic and immanent Trinity**, and his work remains foundational for theologians seeking to ground doctrine in Scripture.
