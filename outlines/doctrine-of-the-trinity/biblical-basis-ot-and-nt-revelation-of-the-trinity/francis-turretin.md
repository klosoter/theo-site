# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin rigorously defended the **doctrine of the Trinity** by grounding it in both **Old Testament** and **New Testament revelation**. He argued that while the **Trinitarian mystery** is more clearly revealed in the New Testament, the **unity and plurality** of the Godhead are already present in the Old Testament, and that both Testaments together provide the full biblical basis for the orthodox doctrine.

- "Although the mystery of the Trinity is more clearly revealed in the New Testament, the seeds and beginnings of it are found in the Old." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, III.23.5)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Book III, Questions 23–25)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Theological Questions (Quaestiones Theologicae Selectae)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of God in Both Testaments**
   - The **unity of the divine essence** is foundational and is consistently affirmed in both Old and New Testaments.
   - Turretin emphasizes **Deuteronomy 6:4** ("Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one") as the bedrock of biblical monotheism.
   - He insists that the **Trinity** does not compromise the unity of God but clarifies it.
   - The **oneness** of God is never set aside by later revelation.
   - "The unity of God is so clearly taught in the Old Testament that it is the foundation of all subsequent revelation." (Institutes, III.23.2)

2. **Plurality of Persons Hinted in the Old Testament**
   - Turretin identifies **plural references** (e.g., "Let us make man" in Genesis 1:26) as early indications of plurality within the Godhead.
   - He notes the appearance of the **Angel of the Lord** as a distinct divine person.
   - The use of **Elohim** in the plural form is seen as suggestive of more than one person.
   - He argues that these hints are not explicit but are clarified by later revelation.
   - "The Old Testament contains the seeds of the Trinity, though the doctrine is not fully unfolded until the New." (Institutes, III.23.5)

3. **Full Revelation in the New Testament**
   - The **New Testament** provides explicit teaching on the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** as distinct persons.
   - Passages such as the **baptismal formula** (Matthew 28:19) and the **benediction** (2 Corinthians 13:14) are central.
   - The **incarnation** and **mission of the Spirit** make the distinctions within the Godhead unmistakable.
   - Turretin sees the New Testament as the "light" that makes the Old Testament "shadows" clear.
   - "The New Testament brings to light what was veiled in the Old, namely, the distinct persons in the one divine essence." (Institutes, III.23.6)

4. **Continuity and Progression of Revelation**
   - Turretin affirms a **progressive revelation**, where the Trinity is revealed "from seed to flower."
   - He denies any contradiction between the Testaments, insisting on their **organic unity**.
   - The Old Testament prepares for, and the New Testament fulfills, the doctrine of the Trinity.
   - He maintains that the **Trinitarian doctrine** is not a novelty but the culmination of biblical teaching.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not new, but more clearly revealed as the history of redemption unfolds." (Institutes, III.23.7)

5. **Scriptural Sufficiency for the Trinity**
   - Turretin insists that **Scripture alone** is the sufficient and final authority for the doctrine of the Trinity.
   - He rejects any reliance on **philosophical speculation** apart from biblical revelation.
   - The **biblical texts** are to be interpreted in their canonical context, with clear passages illuminating the obscure.
   - He upholds the **analogy of faith** in interpreting Trinitarian texts.
   - "We do not invent the Trinity by human reason, but receive it from the mouth of God in Scripture." (Institutes, III.23.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful articulation of the **biblical basis for the Trinity** became a standard for later Reformed orthodoxy. His exegetical method, which harmonized **Old and New Testament revelation**, influenced generations of theologians and confessional documents. By insisting on the sufficiency of Scripture and the organic unity of biblical revelation, Turretin provided a robust defense against both anti-Trinitarian and rationalist critiques. His work remains a touchstone for those defending the classical doctrine of the Trinity on exegetical grounds.
