# Michael S. Heiser (1963–2023)

Michael S. Heiser argued that the **Trinity** is rooted in both **Old Testament** and **New Testament revelation**, emphasizing the presence of a **divine plurality** in the Hebrew Scriptures and its fulfillment in the person of **Jesus Christ** and the **Holy Spirit** in the New Testament. Heiser’s scholarship highlights the continuity between the **Second Temple Jewish context** and early Christian formulations of the **triune God**, challenging the notion that the Trinity is a purely post-biblical development.

- Supernatural: What the Bible Teaches About the Unseen World—and Why It Matters
- "Monotheism, Polytheism, Monolatry, or Henotheism? Toward an Assessment of Divine Plurality in the Hebrew Bible" (Bulletin for Biblical Research)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Plurality in the Old Testament**
   - Argues that passages like Genesis 1:26 and Psalm 82 indicate a plurality within the Godhead.
   - Emphasizes the "two powers in heaven" tradition in Second Temple Judaism.
   - Sees the "Angel of the Lord" as a visible Yahweh distinct from but identified with God.
   - Maintains that Israelite religion was not strictly **unitarian**.
   - "The Old Testament Godhead is not a later Christian invention, but a biblical reality." (The Unseen Realm)

2. **Continuity Between Testaments**
   - Asserts that the New Testament writers drew on Old Testament categories to articulate the Trinity.
   - Identifies Jesus as the embodied Yahweh anticipated in the Hebrew Bible.
   - Highlights the role of the Spirit as present and active in both Testaments.
   - Argues that early Christians did not invent but inherited their **Trinitarian** framework.
   - "The New Testament writers saw Jesus and the Spirit as fulfilling Old Testament expectations of divine plurality." (The Unseen Realm)

3. **Second Temple Jewish Context**
   - Utilizes Jewish literature to show acceptance of divine plurality before Christianity.
   - Points to the "two powers" doctrine as evidence of pre-Christian Trinitarian thought.
   - Argues that later rabbinic Judaism suppressed these ideas in response to Christianity.
   - Emphasizes the importance of understanding the Bible in its ancient context.
   - "Second Temple Judaism was not uniformly opposed to the idea of multiple divine persons." (The Unseen Realm)

4. **Rejection of Strict Monotheism**
   - Distinguishes between **monotheism** and **monolatry** in Israel’s faith.
   - Argues that biblical monotheism allows for a complex unity within the Godhead.
   - Critiques the modern assumption that biblical faith is strictly unitarian.
   - Shows that the biblical God is unique, but not solitary.
   - "Biblical monotheism is not threatened by the presence of other divine beings or persons." (The Unseen Realm)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for the Trinity**
   - Grounds the doctrine of the Trinity in exegesis of both Old and New Testaments.
   - Highlights key texts (e.g., Isaiah 48:16; Matthew 28:19; John 1:1) as evidence.
   - Argues that the Trinity is not a later theological imposition but a biblical teaching.
   - Emphasizes the necessity of reading Scripture in its own terms, not through later dogmatic lenses.
   - "The Trinity is a biblical doctrine, not merely a product of church councils." (The Unseen Realm)

## Legacy and Impact

Heiser’s work has significantly influenced contemporary evangelical scholarship on the **biblical foundations of the Trinity**, especially by recovering the importance of **divine plurality** in the Old Testament. His research has encouraged a re-examination of traditional assumptions about **monotheism** and the development of Christian doctrine. By situating the Trinity within its ancient Jewish context, Heiser has provided new avenues for dialogue between biblical studies and systematic theology. His accessible writing and popular-level works have broadened the conversation beyond the academy, shaping how pastors and laypeople approach the doctrine of the Trinity.
