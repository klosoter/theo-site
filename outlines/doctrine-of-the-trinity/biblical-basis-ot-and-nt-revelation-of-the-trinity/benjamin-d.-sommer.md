# Benjamin D. Sommer (b. 1964)

Benjamin D. Sommer is a Jewish biblical scholar whose work explores the **revelation of God** in the **Old Testament**, particularly focusing on the **divine plurality** and the **fluidity of divine selfhood**. Sommer argues that the **Hebrew Bible** contains complex and sometimes paradoxical depictions of God that anticipate later **Trinitarian** discussions, though from within a distinctively Jewish context. He contends that the **New Testament**'s revelation of the Trinity develops themes already present in Israel's Scriptures, especially regarding God's presence and multiplicity.

- "The fluidity model of divinity, which is so prominent in the Hebrew Bible, is not a form of polytheism but a way of describing the one God’s presence in multiple forms." (The Bodies of God, p. 145)

## Key Works

- The Bodies of God and the World of Ancient Israel (2009)
- Revelation and Authority: Sinai in Jewish Scripture and Tradition (2015)
- "Monotheism and the Language of Divine Plurality in the Hebrew Bible" (Journal of Biblical Literature, 2008)
- "The Fluidity of Divine Selfhood" (in The Jewish Study Bible, 2nd ed., 2014)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Divine Plurality in the Old Testament**
    - The Hebrew Bible presents God as manifesting in multiple forms or personae.
    - Passages such as Genesis 18 and Exodus 24 depict God’s presence in more than one location or form simultaneously.
    - This plurality is not polytheism but a complex monotheism.
    - The concept of **angelic mediators** and the "Name of God" reflects this multiplicity.
    - "Ancient Israelites could imagine a single deity who had several bodies or localized presences." (The Bodies of God, p. 32)

2. **Continuity Between Old Testament and Later Trinitarian Thought**
    - The fluidity model in the Hebrew Bible provides conceptual space for later Christian Trinitarianism.
    - Early Christian claims about Jesus and the Spirit are not as foreign to biblical monotheism as often assumed.
    - Both traditions wrestle with the problem of divine transcendence and immanence.
    - Jewish and Christian readings diverge in application but share underlying biblical motifs.
    - "The New Testament’s talk of the Word or Spirit as divine hypostases is not a radical break from Israelite religion." (The Bodies of God, p. 135)

3. **Revelation as Ongoing and Multifaceted**
    - Revelation in the Hebrew Bible is not a single event but a process involving multiple encounters.
    - Sinai is paradigmatic but not exhaustive of God’s self-disclosure.
    - Prophetic and theophanic experiences reveal different aspects of God’s character.
    - The diversity of revelation anticipates later theological developments.
    - "Revelation in the Bible is not a monolithic event but a series of encounters with the divine." (Revelation and Authority, p. 41)

4. **Rejection of Simple Monotheism**
    - Sommer critiques the notion that biblical monotheism is strictly unitary.
    - The biblical God is not confined to a single, indivisible form.
    - Ancient Israelite religion allowed for complexity within the divine identity.
    - This complexity is compatible with later theological reflection on the Trinity.
    - "Biblical monotheism is not the same as philosophical monotheism; it is more dynamic and complex." (The Bodies of God, p. 145)

5. **Hermeneutical Openness to Christian Trinitarian Claims**
    - Sommer acknowledges that Christian Trinitarian theology is a legitimate interpretation of biblical data, though not the only one.
    - He maintains a Jewish reading but recognizes the biblical roots of Trinitarianism.
    - The Old Testament’s language about God’s presence and agency supports multiple theological trajectories.
    - Respectful dialogue between Jewish and Christian interpretations is possible and fruitful.
    - "Christian Trinitarianism is one possible, though not necessary, reading of the Hebrew Bible’s theology." (The Bodies of God, p. 145)

## Legacy and Impact

Sommer’s scholarship has significantly influenced contemporary discussions of **biblical monotheism** and the **theological interpretation of Scripture**. His analysis of divine plurality in the Old Testament has opened new avenues for dialogue between Jewish and Christian theologians, particularly regarding the roots of Trinitarian thought. By highlighting the complexity and richness of biblical revelation, Sommer has challenged simplistic readings and encouraged deeper engagement with the text’s theological dimensions. His work remains a touchstone for those exploring the intersection of ancient Israelite religion and later doctrinal developments.
