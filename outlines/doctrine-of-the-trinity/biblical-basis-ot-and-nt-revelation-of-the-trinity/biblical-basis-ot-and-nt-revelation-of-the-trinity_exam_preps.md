### TITLE
One God, Three Persons: Reading Old and New Testament Revelation as a Unified Trinitarian Witness

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How the one God of Israel is revealed in both Old and New Testaments as Father, Son, and Spirit without breaking **monotheism** or collapsing into subordinationism or modalism, and how this shapes a canonical doctrine of the **Trinity**.
- Decisive figures: Athanasius, Augustine, John Calvin, B. B. Warfield, Herman Bavinck.
- Relevant traditions: Nicene and pro‑Nicene patristic theology, Augustinian Latin trinitarianism, Reformed confessional theology, with attention to modern historical‑critical challenges.
- Debates:
  - Internal: pro‑Nicene exegesis versus more speculative models, differing emphases among Reformed on **economic** and **immanent Trinity**.
  - External: Jewish and Islamic criticisms of the Trinity as betrayal of **Old Testament monotheism**; liberal and subordinationist readings of New Testament Christology and pneumatology.
  - Contemporary: “incipient binitarianism,” narrative-historical readings of Jesus, revisionist proposals on **eternal functional subordination**, and questions about **progressive revelation** and biblical theology.
- Defended position: The Old and New Testaments together, when read canonically and christologically, give a coherent and sufficient revelatory basis for the confession of one simple God in three coequal, coeternal persons, with the New Testament providing explicit clarity that is already genuinely, though typologically and often veiledly, present in the Old.

### ESSAY
The question of the biblical basis of the Trinity presses immediately on the relation of **monotheism** and Christology, of Israel’s Scriptures and the gospel, and of **progressive revelation** and dogmatic formulation. To say that God is one essence in three persons is to speak in conceptual terms that transcend the explicit vocabulary of either Testament, and yet the Christian claim is that this dogma is not a speculative superstructure but the necessary conceptual grammar demanded by the way God has acted and spoken in redemptive history. The task, then, is to show how the Old and New Testaments, in their own idiom, jointly bear witness to Father, Son, and Spirit as the one Lord, and to defend that claim against both internal and external critics.

Athanasius stands at the hinge between biblical exegesis and dogmatic precision. His struggle with Arianism was not merely about a metaphysical point regarding the Son’s essence but about the biblical portrayal of salvation, worship, and revelation. Against Arius’s claim that the Son was a creature exalted above others, Athanasius insisted, on exegetical grounds, that only if the Son is truly God from God can he deify those he redeems. He read key New Testament texts such as John 1, Colossians 1, and Hebrews 1 as ascribing to the Son the divine prerogatives of creation, providence, and worship that in the Old Testament belong to YHWH alone. When Hebrews 1 applies Psalm 102’s address to YHWH, “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth,” to the Son, Athanasius argued, Scripture itself is identifying the Son with the Lord of Israel. To deny the Son’s full deity is thus to divide the Lord of Psalm 102 from the Lord of Hebrews 1, which is to rupture the unity of God’s self-revelation.

But Athanasius also read the Old Testament itself as already thick with trinitarian contours. His polemical treatises repeatedly return to Old Testament theophanies and wisdom texts. The Angel of the Lord who speaks as God, receives worship, yet is distinguished from God, as in Exodus 3 and Judges 13, cannot for Athanasius be a created angel without collapsing the distinction between Creator and creature in Israel’s worship. Likewise, the Wisdom of God in Proverbs 8, personified as eternally with God, delighting in his presence, Athanasius reads as a figure of the eternal Son. Critical examiners might object that this collapses literary personification into hypostatic identity, but Athanasius does not argue syllogistically from personification to person. He argues that the convergence of Old Testament themes of divine Word, Wisdom, and Glory, when read in light of their New Testament fulfillment, reveals a divine person who is with God and is God. His method is fundamentally canonical: the same God who inspires the Old Testament discloses more of himself in Christ, and this fuller light retrospectively illumines earlier shadows. Athanasius’s significance for our topic is that he taught the church to see Christ not as imposed on Israel’s Scriptures but as their key, so that an Old Testament already marked by inner distinctions within the one God is properly read as a preparatory revelation of the **Trinity**.

Augustine deepened this canonical approach by articulating a more reflective account of how the two Testaments relate in their trinitarian witness. He is decisive not mainly because of speculative analogies but because of his insistence that the missions of Son and Spirit in time reveal what is eternally true of God. In De Trinitate Augustine argues from the economy to the immanent life of God while rigorously guarding **divine simplicity** and unity. The Father sends the Son and the Spirit in history, but this temporal sending corresponds to the Son’s eternal being from the Father and the Spirit’s eternal procession from Father and Son. Examiners will press here: does this not illegitimately project temporal distinctions into God’s eternal life? Augustine’s response is to stress that we only know God from his acts, and yet God is not other in himself than he is in his saving works. If we deny that the temporal missions signify eternal relations, we risk making the Trinity in history a mere mask. If we confuse the temporal with the eternal, we make God dependent on the world. Augustine’s solution is to maintain that God’s external works are undivided, yet certain acts are fittingly appropriated to particular persons according to their eternal relations of origin. Hence the Son’s incarnation reveals him as the one eternally begotten, not because incarnation is necessary to his being Son, but because only a begotten Son can be sent as Word and Image.

Augustine’s famous exegesis of Old Testament theophanies also matters. Against those who would say that the appearing Lord or Angel of the Lord is the preincarnate Son in visible form, Augustine argues that all creaturely appearances are manifestations of the entire Trinity, since no divine person is ever absent from any divine act. Yet the language of Scripture at times focuses on one person to teach us relational distinctions within the one God. This strategy is important for resisting cruder forms of reading Christ directly into every Old Testament phenomenon while still insisting that the Old Testament is truly trinitarian in content. Augustine’s handling of texts like Genesis 1 shows this balance. “Let us make man in our image” is not decisive proof text for plurality of persons, yet, together with the already strict affirmation of one God and the later revelation of Father, Son, and Spirit, it coheres elegantly within a trinitarian reading. For Augustine, the Old Testament provides the grammar of **monotheism**, divine Word, Spirit, and theophany; the New Testament articulates with clarity that the Word and the Spirit are divine persons, and the church’s dogma supplies the needed conceptual terms.

The Reformed tradition, particularly in Calvin, receives and sharpens this patristic and Augustinian heritage with an even more pronounced concern for **exegesis**. Calvin is a decisive figure because his Institutes and commentaries show how a rigorously textual approach yields a robust trinitarian confession without speculative flights. Calvin insists that the doctrine of the Trinity is “scripturally derived,” not a philosophical overlay. Yet he is acutely aware that the technical language of ousia and hypostasis is extra-biblical. His strategy is to argue that while these terms are not in Scripture, their referents are, and we adopt the terms to safeguard Scripture’s teaching against heresy.

On Old Testament revelation, Calvin is more restrained than many medievals. He criticizes “unwise” readings that find Christ in every Old Testament passage, but he does not retreat into a flat unitarian reading. The Angel of the Lord narratives he identifies as manifestations of the Son, precisely because these figures function with divine authority and receive worship. On Genesis 1 and the plural “let us,” Calvin does not rest heavily on the grammatical plurality but sees it as compatible with what is made explicit later, namely that the Father creates through the Son and by the Spirit. This is consistent with his broader biblical-theological argument: the covenant God of Abraham is the Father of Jesus Christ, and the same Spirit who hovered over the waters is poured out at Pentecost. Calvin’s emphasis on the unity of the **covenant of grace** means that the trinitarian God is not a New Testament novelty but the continuous agent of redemptive history. His accounts of Word and Spirit in revelation are decisive: the external word of Scripture and the internal witness of the Spirit together effect saving knowledge, and these are distinct yet inseparable operations of the Son as Word and the Spirit as illuminator. This epistemological dimension shows how the doctrine of the Trinity coordinates with **revelation** and **soteriology**.

Critically, Calvin avoids both subordinationism and modalism. The Son is autotheos, God of himself as to essence, although as person he is from the Father. This nuanced position preempts some contemporary confusions in debates over the so-called eternal functional subordination of the Son. Examiners may ask whether such Reformed emphases find explicit basis in the text. Calvin will point to the New Testament’s double pattern: Christ is both subordinate as incarnate mediator and yet repeatedly identified with YHWH. For example, in Romans 10, Joel 2’s “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord” is applied to Jesus. Likewise, Philippians 2 culminates with every knee bowing and every tongue confessing Jesus as Lord, echoing Isaiah 45’s exclusive claim for YHWH. Calvin treats such intertextual moves as intentional apostolic identifications of Jesus with Israel’s God, not as mere honorifics. This is one core plank in the biblical basis for confessing the Son as fully divine.

B. B. Warfield brings this trajectory into explicit focus by asking how the two Testaments together reveal the Trinity. His famous formulation that in the Old Testament the Trinity is “contained” and in the New “revealed” has sometimes been misused to flatten the Old Testament into an almost unitarian document. But Warfield’s actual argument, in “The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity,” is more subtle. The Old Testament, he notes, rigorously affirms one God, yet also presents a complex picture of divine Word, Wisdom, and Spirit that is not easily reduced to mere impersonal attributes. The Spirit in the Old Testament is not yet clearly a distinct person but is more than a mere force. The “word of the Lord” comes, speaks, creates, and is personified in ways that exceed abstract quality. Moreover, texts like Isaiah 63 already narrate the Lord, his angel of his presence, and his Spirit in a triadic pattern. Warfield’s point is that the Old Testament prepares categories and patterns into which the New Testament’s explicit trinitarian revelation naturally fits. It does not give a complete doctrine of three persons, but it does sow seeds and set coordinates.

Warfield is especially helpful at the New Testament level because he reads across the canon rather than privileging a few high-christology texts. He notes that in the synoptic Gospels, the baptismal scene already presents Father, Son, and Spirit together in an economic manifestation: the Father’s voice, the descending Spirit, the beloved Son. There is no doctrinal disquisition, but the narrative presupposes real distinction and coordinated action. In the Great Commission, baptism is commanded into the one name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Warfield asks: what kind of being must the Son and the Spirit be for believers to be baptized into their single name together with the Father? Such liturgical and doxological patterns, repeated in Pauline benedictions such as 2 Corinthians 13, signal that the New Testament church functioned with a trinitarian consciousness, even if not yet with Nicene vocabulary. Against external objections from Judaism or Islam that the Trinity destroys monotheism, Warfield insists that the New Testament writers are fiercely monotheistic, precisely by reserving the divine name and functions for Father, Son, and Spirit alone. The challenge is not that monotheism is abandoned, but that it is now understood as triune monotheism.

Herman Bavinck synthesizes much of this earlier work and situates the biblical basis of the Trinity within a richly integrated Reformed dogmatics. Bavinck is decisive because he refuses both rationalistic proofs and purely historical reconstructions. He argues that the Trinity is the “foundational mystery” of the Christian religion because the entire order of creation, revelation, and redemption is trinitarian. The Father is the source, the Son the mediator, and the Spirit the perfecter, in one undivided divine work. For Bavinck, the Old Testament already bears this threefold pattern in narrative and cultic form, even if the terms Father, Son, and Spirit are not yet consciously understood as hypostases within the one God. He points to texts where God, his Word, and his Spirit are jointly operative, to the divine wisdom of Proverbs, and to the eschatological promises in prophets like Ezekiel and Joel where the Spirit is poured out by the Lord in a manner that presupposes personal agency.

Bavinck is keenly aware of internal debates within the Reformed tradition and beyond. He knows speculative schemes that overly allegorize the Old Testament or find explicit Trinity in every triad, and he rejects them. Yet he also critiques modern historical-critical scholarship that severs Old and New Testaments so radically that any canonical trinitarian reading is deemed illegitimate. His answer is to insist on **organic revelation**: God’s self-disclosure unfolds historically and progressively, but the same triune God is at work throughout. If the ontological Trinity is not truly present in the Old Testament, then the God of Israel and the God of the New Testament would differ in being, not merely in degree of revealedness. That is impossible. Therefore the Old Testament, read in canonical context, must be truly trinitarian in content, even if economically and typologically.

The external debate with Judaism and Islam sharpens this point. Both traditions limit legitimate Jewish monotheism to something like a strict unipersonalism and reject New Testament claims about Jesus and the Spirit as later distortions. In response, one must show that the New Testament does not add other gods alongside YHWH but identifies Jesus and the Spirit within the unique divine identity. Richard Bauckham’s language of “divine identity,” though not a decisive figure in the same sense as those already treated, captures what Warfield and Bavinck in effect practice: reading New Testament Christology and pneumatology as including Jesus and the Spirit within the unique prerogatives of the Lord of Israel rather than relativizing them beneath him. When Philippians 2 places Jesus at the eschatological center of every knee bowing and every tongue confessing, in the very terms Isaiah uses of YHWH’s exclusive glory, the text demands that worship be given to Jesus in the very sense due to God alone. The same logic applies to the Spirit, who searches the depths of God and distributes gifts as he wills, who can be grieved, lied to, and blasphemed in ways that presuppose personal deity.

Internal Christian debates have recently centered on the relation of the **economic** and **immanent Trinity** and the so-called eternal functional subordination of the Son. Some evangelicals have argued that the New Testament pattern of the Son’s obedience and submission to the Father grounds an eternal relation of authority and submission between the persons. Examined carefully, this proposal threatens to reopen Arian or subordinationist trajectories. The biblical economy clearly distinguishes the Son’s incarnate obedience from his eternal deity. Passages like John 5, which affirm the Son’s doing nothing of himself but only what he sees the Father doing, simultaneously affirm that whatever the Father does the Son does likewise and that all must honor the Son as they honor the Father. The submission in view is that of the incarnate Son in the form of a servant, not an ontological inferiority or eternal hierarchy of authority within the divine essence. Calvin’s careful distinction between the Son’s mediatorial office and his essential equality, Augustine’s doctrine of missions and processions, and Bavinck’s warnings against dividing the will of God among three centers all converge to insist that while the Son is eternally from the Father, he is not less than the Father in authority or power as God. The New Testament’s economic pattern cannot be simplistically projected back into the immanent Trinity without qualification.

Another contemporary challenge comes from narrative-historical readings of the New Testament that treat divine titles and honors given to Jesus and the Spirit as functions within Israel’s story rather than as indicators of metaphysical identity. According to such readings, Jesus is vindicated and exalted as messianic agent of God and thus shares in God’s rule but is not himself truly YHWH. This view fails to take seriously the ways New Testament authors deliberately echo Old Testament texts about YHWH and apply them to Jesus and the Spirit in contexts of worship and invocation. For example, calling upon the name of the Lord in Acts 2, understood in the light of Joel 2, is a cultic act directed now to Jesus. Similarly, the benedictions that place the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit on equal footing are not mere rhetorical flourishes but liturgical crystallizations of a trinitarian consciousness. The early church did not feel free to distribute divine honors in this way unless compelled by the reality of Christ’s resurrection, the giving of the Spirit, and the scriptural patterns that framed these events. Athanasius’s point becomes relevant again: if the Son and Spirit were not truly God, to worship them would be idolatry, and Scripture would lead us into idolatry.

Throughout, the theme of **analogical knowledge** must be kept in view. Scripture does not give us a univocal description of God as if our concepts could capture his being. It speaks analogically, yet truly. When the Bible calls God Father, Son, and Spirit, when it ascribes to them actions and relations, it does so in a way accommodated to us, yet revealing of who God really is. The doctrine of the Trinity is the church’s effort, following figures like Augustine, Calvin, Warfield, and Bavinck, to formulate faithfully what these analogical patterns imply. The Old Testament’s strict **monotheism**, its intense narratives of the Angel of the Lord, its personified Word and Wisdom, its pervasive Spirit, combine with the New Testament’s explicit confession of Jesus as Lord and the Spirit as Lord and giver of life, to yield a coherent picture: the one God of Israel eternally exists as Father, Son, and Spirit, consubstantial and coequal, distinguished by relations of origin, revealed through missions in redemptive history.

In defending this position, one must resist two opposite errors. On one side, a proof-texting that imagines the Trinity to be simply stated in some isolated Old Testament verse ignores the historical unfolding of revelation. On the other, a historicism that denies any real trinitarian content to the Old Testament and treats Nicene dogma as a post-biblical construction severs the unity of Scripture and destroys the continuity of God’s self-revelation. The path charted by Athanasius, Augustine, Calvin, Warfield, and Bavinck navigates between these extremes by affirming **progressive revelation** of the same triune God. The Old Testament is genuinely trinitarian in its content, though shadowy and preparatory; the New Testament is lucidly and explicitly trinitarian, not by inventing new deities but by manifesting in history the Son and the Spirit who were already at work from the beginning.

This doctrine in turn stabilizes other loci. **Christology** presupposes that the one person of Christ is the eternal Son who assumed a human nature. **Pneumatology** rests on the Spirit as distinct person who perfects the work of Christ. **Soteriology** depends on the Father’s electing love, the Son’s accomplished redemption, and the Spirit’s applicatory work. If the biblical basis of the Trinity were weak, these doctrines would be speculative. But the same canonical patterns that undergird the Trinity also structure the entire economy of salvation.

For oral defense, then, the crucial move is to show how representative Old Testament texts already manifest complex unity in God’s self-presentation, and how New Testament texts, read against that backdrop, compel us to say that the God of Israel is now known in the face of Jesus Christ and in the presence of the Spirit, without ceasing to be one God. The doctrine of the Trinity is not an abstract puzzle tacked onto Scripture; it is the church’s confession of what Scripture, Old and New, inexorably presses upon us when read in the light of Christ.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The Bible reveals one simple, indivisible God who eternally exists as three coequal, coeternal persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with the Old Testament giving a genuine but veiled trinitarian pattern and the New Testament giving explicit clarity through the missions of Son and Spirit.
- Decisive figures:
  - Athanasius: reads Old and New Testaments canonically, insisting that the Son shares YHWH’s identity and that salvation and worship demand full deity of Son and Spirit.
  - Augustine: develops relation of **economic** to **immanent Trinity**, arguing that temporal missions reveal eternal relations, and offers nuanced exegesis of theophanies and plural language.
  - Calvin: grounds trinitarian dogma in strict exegesis, stresses unity of covenant history, and distinguishes the Son’s mediatorial subordination from his essential equality.
  - Warfield: articulates “contained in the Old, revealed in the New,” showing Old Testament complexity and New Testament triadic patterns as basis for Nicene confession.
  - Bavinck: synthesizes tradition in a Reformed key, emphasizing organic, progressive revelation and the Trinity as the structural mystery of creation, revelation, and redemption.
- Debates:
  - Internal: degree and mode of Old Testament trinitarian presence, the relation of missions to processions, and the legitimacy of appeals to eternal functional subordination.
  - External: Jewish and Islamic objections that the Trinity violates **Old Testament monotheism**, and liberal or narrative-historical claims that New Testament honors to Jesus and the Spirit are merely functional.
  - Contemporary: “binitarian” readings of the New Testament, historicist denials of Old Testament trinitarian content, and disputes over projecting economic patterns into the immanent life of God.
- Defended position: The one God of Israel is eternally triune; the Old Testament truly, though often typologically and veiledly, reveals Father, Son, and Spirit, and the New Testament, in continuity with that revelation, explicitly includes Jesus and the Spirit within the unique divine identity, so that Nicene trinitarian dogma is a faithful conceptual summary of the Bible’s own witness.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - “Where is the Trinity in the Old Testament?”  
    In the complex presentation of God’s Word, Wisdom, and Spirit, and in texts like the Angel of the Lord and Isaiah 63, which, read canonically, show real plurality within the one God.
  - “Does the New Testament abandon Jewish monotheism?”  
    No, it intensifies it by identifying Jesus and the Spirit within YHWH’s unique identity, not alongside him as other gods.
  - “Are economic subordination texts proof of eternal subordination?”  
    No, they describe the incarnate Son’s mediatorial obedience, while the same texts assert his equality and shared divine prerogatives.
  - “Is Nicene language biblical?”  
    The terms are extra-biblical, but they are necessary to safeguard the realities Scripture teaches about Father, Son, and Spirit as one God in three persons.
  - “How does progressive revelation avoid implying two different gods?”  
    Because the same triune God acts throughout; revelation progresses in clarity, not in the being of God, so what is explicit in the New was genuinely, though dimly, present in the Old.
