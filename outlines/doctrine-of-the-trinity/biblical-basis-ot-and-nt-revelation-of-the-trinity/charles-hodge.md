# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge maintained that the **doctrine of the Trinity** is firmly rooted in both **Old Testament revelation** and the **New Testament fulfillment**, insisting that the full clarity of the Trinity emerges only with the coming of Christ. He argued that while the **unity of God** is explicit in the Old Testament, the **distinctions of persons**—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—are progressively revealed and fully disclosed in the New Testament, all under the authority of **inspired Scripture**.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is not so much taught in the Old Testament as presupposed, while in the New Testament it is clearly revealed." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially chapters on the Trinity and Scripture)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on the Trinity

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Only Infallible Rule**
   - The **Trinity** must be derived solely from the **inspired Scriptures**.
   - Both **Old and New Testaments** are authoritative for doctrine.
   - Human reason is subordinate to divine revelation.
   - All theological formulations must be tested by the biblical text.
   - "The Bible, and the Bible alone, is the religion of Protestants." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Progressive Revelation of the Trinity**
   - The **unity of God** is the dominant theme in the Old Testament.
   - Hints of plurality (e.g., Elohim, the Angel of the Lord) anticipate fuller revelation.
   - The **New Testament** explicitly reveals the three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
   - The doctrine is not a later invention but the culmination of biblical revelation.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity underlies the whole New Testament." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Equality and Distinction of Persons**
   - Each person of the Trinity is fully **God**, possessing the same divine essence.
   - The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct, not merely modes or manifestations.
   - The distinctions are personal, not essential or subordinate in deity.
   - The **Son** and **Spirit** are revealed as co-equal with the Father in the New Testament.
   - "The distinction of the persons is as clearly revealed as their unity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Old Testament Anticipation**
   - The Old Testament contains **types, theophanies, and plural references** that foreshadow the Trinity.
   - Passages like Genesis 1:26 and Isaiah 6:8 suggest plurality within the Godhead.
   - The **Angel of the Lord** is identified with God yet distinguished from Him.
   - Full doctrinal clarity is reserved for the New Testament era.
   - "The Old Testament is full of adumbrations and predictions of the doctrine." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **New Testament Fulfillment**
   - The **baptismal formula** (Matthew 28:19) and apostolic benedictions reveal the triune name.
   - Jesus’ teaching and the apostolic writings make explicit the personal distinctions.
   - The **incarnation** and **Pentecost** are pivotal events for Trinitarian revelation.
   - The New Testament church confesses one God in three persons as the foundation of faith.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all revealed religion." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **biblical doctrine of the Trinity** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially through his influential role at Princeton Seminary. His insistence on the **primacy of Scripture** and the organic unity between Old and New Testament revelation provided a model for evangelical engagement with biblical theology. Hodge’s work remains a standard reference for understanding the exegetical and theological grounding of the Trinity in the Reformed tradition. His careful articulation of the equality and distinction of the divine persons continues to inform contemporary systematic theology.
