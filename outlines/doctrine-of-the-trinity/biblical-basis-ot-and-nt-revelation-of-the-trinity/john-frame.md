# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the **biblical basis for the Trinity** by emphasizing the unity and diversity of God's self-revelation in both the **Old and New Testaments**. He argues that the **Trinitarian nature of God** is progressively revealed, with the **New Testament** providing the fullest disclosure, yet rooted in the **monotheistic framework** of the Old Testament. Frame insists that **Scripture** itself, rather than philosophical speculation, is the foundation for understanding the Trinity.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is not the result of speculative philosophy, but of the church’s effort to be faithful to the teaching of Scripture." (The Doctrine of God)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Norm for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - The doctrine of the Trinity must be derived from **biblical revelation**, not external philosophy.
    - Both **Old and New Testaments** are essential for a full understanding of God's triune nature.
    - The **unity and diversity** in the biblical presentation of God point toward the Trinity.
    - Frame emphasizes the sufficiency and clarity of **Scripture** for doctrinal formulation.
    - "We must seek to derive our doctrine of God from Scripture alone." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Progressive Revelation of the Trinity**
    - The **Old Testament** contains hints and anticipations of plurality within the Godhead.
    - The **New Testament** reveals the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit distinctly, yet as one God.
    - Frame sees the **incarnation** and **Pentecost** as climactic moments in Trinitarian revelation.
    - He stresses the continuity between the testaments in revealing the one true God.
    - "The New Testament brings the hints of the Old Testament to their full clarity." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Monotheism and Trinitarian Distinctions**
    - The **oneness of God** is foundational and never compromised in Trinitarian doctrine.
    - The **three persons** are fully and equally God, yet personally distinct.
    - Frame rejects both **modalism** and **tritheism** as unbiblical distortions.
    - He highlights the relational dynamics within the Godhead as revealed in Scripture.
    - "The biblical God is both one and three, and we must affirm both aspects." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Covenantal Lordship and the Trinity**
    - Frame’s **triperspectivalism** sees God's lordship expressed in three interrelated perspectives: authority, control, and presence.
    - He connects these perspectives to the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** in redemptive history.
    - The Trinity is not an abstract doctrine but is central to God's covenantal dealings with his people.
    - Frame argues that the Trinity grounds the **personal and relational** nature of God's lordship.
    - "God’s lordship is triune, and each person of the Trinity is involved in all his works." (The Doctrine of God)

5. **Christological and Pneumatological Fulfillment**
    - The **incarnation of Christ** and the sending of the **Holy Spirit** are the clearest revelations of the Trinity.
    - Jesus’ relationship with the Father and the Spirit in the Gospels demonstrates Trinitarian dynamics.
    - The **Great Commission** (Matthew 28:19) is a key text for the explicit Trinitarian formula.
    - Frame sees the work of redemption as the unified mission of the triune God.
    - "The redemptive work of God is the work of the Father, Son, and Spirit together." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by grounding the doctrine of the Trinity in the entirety of **biblical revelation**. His emphasis on **triperspectivalism** and the covenantal context of God's triune lordship has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to the doctrine. Frame’s insistence on the sufficiency of Scripture and his clear articulation of the Trinity’s biblical basis continue to serve as a resource for students, pastors, and theologians seeking a robust, scripturally-rooted understanding of the triune God.
