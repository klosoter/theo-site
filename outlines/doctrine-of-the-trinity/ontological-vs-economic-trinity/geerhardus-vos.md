# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos distinguished carefully between the **ontological Trinity** (God as He is in Himself, ad intra) and the **economic Trinity** (God as revealed in redemptive history, ad extra). He emphasized that while the **persons of the Godhead** are eternally distinct in their **subsistence**, their roles in **revelation** and **redemption** reflect the eternal order without dividing the divine essence. Vos’s biblical-theological method highlighted how the **self-revelation of God** in history presupposes and is grounded in the eternal relations within the Godhead.

- "The revelation of God in history presupposes a trinitarian background in the being of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Ontological and Economic Trinity**
    - The **ontological Trinity** refers to God’s eternal, internal relations—Father, Son, and Spirit as one essence.
    - The **economic Trinity** concerns God’s actions and roles in creation, redemption, and revelation.
    - Vos insists that the economic does not introduce new distinctions but reveals what is eternally true in God.
    - The historical unfolding of redemption reflects, but does not alter, the eternal triune relations.
    - "The Trinity in revelation is the Trinity of being; the Trinity of being is the Trinity in revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Unity of Essence, Distinction of Persons**
    - The three persons share the same **divine essence** without division or separation.
    - Each person is fully God, yet personally distinct in relation and role.
    - The **personal properties** (paternity, filiation, procession) are eternal and foundational for economic roles.
    - The unity of God is never compromised by the diversity of persons or their works.
    - "There is but one divine essence, yet in it subsist three persons." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Revelation Rooted in Eternal Trinitarian Relations**
    - God’s self-revelation in history is grounded in His eternal triune being.
    - The **Father** sends, the **Son** is sent and accomplishes redemption, the **Spirit** applies redemption.
    - The economic missions reflect the eternal processions within the Godhead.
    - Vos’s biblical theology traces the progressive unveiling of the Trinity in redemptive history.
    - "The missions of the Son and Spirit presuppose their eternal relations in the Godhead." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

4. **Biblical-Theological Method and the Trinity**
    - Vos’s approach emphasizes the unfolding of the Trinity in the history of revelation.
    - He resists speculative theology detached from **biblical revelation**.
    - The economic Trinity is discerned through the acts of God in Scripture.
    - The **unity of Scripture** is seen in the consistent triune pattern of God’s redemptive work.
    - "Biblical theology shows how the triune God reveals Himself in the progress of redemption." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Safeguarding Divine Simplicity and Immutability**
    - Vos upholds that God’s essence is simple and unchanging, even as He acts in history.
    - The economic distinctions do not imply change or composition in God.
    - The **immutability** of God is compatible with the temporal missions of the Son and Spirit.
    - The ontological Trinity is the necessary ground for the reliability of God’s redemptive acts.
    - "God remains the same in Himself, though He reveals Himself in manifold ways." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s careful distinction between the **ontological** and **economic Trinity** has shaped Reformed approaches to the doctrine of God, ensuring that the unity and simplicity of God are preserved alongside the richness of His self-revelation. His biblical-theological method provided a model for integrating systematic and redemptive-historical perspectives on the Trinity. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of Trinitarian theology, especially regarding the relationship between God’s eternal being and His works in history.
