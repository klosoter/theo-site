# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **ontological** and **economic Trinity** through his distinctive **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing the unity and diversity within the Godhead as foundational to all theology. He affirms the classical distinction between **God’s immanent being** and **His actions in redemptive history**, while insisting that our knowledge of the Trinity is always shaped by God’s self-revelation in Scripture. Frame’s work highlights the inseparability of the **ontological** and **economic** aspects, arguing that the economic Trinity truly reveals the ontological Trinity.

- "The economic Trinity is not a mere mask for the ontological Trinity, but the true revelation of who God is." (The Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- No Other God: A Response to Open Theism (2001)
- Perspectives on the Word of God (1990)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Triperspectival Approach to the Trinity**
    - God’s unity and diversity are best understood through normative, situational, and existential perspectives.
    - Each person of the Trinity can be viewed as a “perspective” on the whole Godhead.
    - This model resists both modalism and tritheism by emphasizing interdependence.
    - The perspectives are not mere analogies but reflect real distinctions in God.
    - "The three persons are not parts of God, but each is the whole God, viewed from a different perspective." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Ontological and Economic Distinction Affirmed**
    - The **ontological Trinity** refers to God as He is in Himself, eternally Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The **economic Trinity** refers to God’s actions in creation and redemption.
    - Frame affirms the classical distinction but warns against separating them too sharply.
    - The economic reveals the ontological; God’s acts in history show who He truly is.
    - "The economic Trinity is the ontological Trinity in action." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Revelation as the Basis for Trinitarian Knowledge**
    - Our knowledge of the Trinity is grounded in **Scripture**, not speculation.
    - God’s self-revelation in redemptive history is trustworthy and sufficient.
    - The economic Trinity is not a lesser or secondary truth but the means by which God makes Himself known.
    - The ontological Trinity is not accessible apart from God’s revelation in history.
    - "We know the ontological Trinity only because God has revealed Himself in the economy of redemption." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Unity of Essence, Distinction of Persons**
    - Frame upholds the **consubstantiality** of the three persons.
    - The persons are distinguished by their relations, not by essence or rank.
    - The economic roles of Father, Son, and Spirit reflect their eternal relations.
    - There is no subordination of essence, only of role within the economy.
    - "The distinctions among the persons are real, but they do not compromise the unity of God’s being." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Practical Implications for Worship and Life**
    - The doctrine of the Trinity shapes Christian worship, prayer, and ethics.
    - Understanding both the ontological and economic Trinity grounds assurance of salvation.
    - The triune God’s unity and diversity provide a model for human relationships and community.
    - Trinitarian theology is not abstract but vital for the Christian life.
    - "The Trinity is not a speculative doctrine, but the very heart of Christian faith and practice." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s **triperspectival** approach has significantly influenced contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of the **Trinity**. His insistence on the inseparability of the ontological and economic Trinity has encouraged theologians to ground doctrinal reflection in Scripture and redemptive history. Frame’s work continues to shape evangelical thought on the nature of God, worship, and the practical outworking of Trinitarian doctrine in the church.
