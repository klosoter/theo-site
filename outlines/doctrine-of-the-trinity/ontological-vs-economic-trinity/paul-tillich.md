# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the distinction between the **ontological Trinity** and the **economic Trinity** through his existential and philosophical framework, emphasizing the **symbolic** and **dynamic** nature of Trinitarian language. For Tillich, the Trinity expresses the **self-manifestation of the divine Ground of Being** in history, with the **immanent** (ontological) and **economic** (historical) aspects reflecting the dialectic between God's eternal nature and God's revelation in time.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity expresses symbolically the self-manifestation of the divine ground of being in the process of revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinity as Symbolic Expression**
   - The Trinity is not a literal description but a **symbol** pointing to the mystery of the divine life.
   - Trinitarian language mediates between **God’s transcendence** and **immanence**.
   - The ontological Trinity represents the **eternal structure** of the divine life.
   - The economic Trinity refers to God’s **self-revelation** in history.
   - "The Trinity is a symbol for the dynamic and relational character of the divine life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Ground of Being and Trinitarian Structure**
   - God is the **Ground of Being**, not a being among others.
   - The ontological Trinity reflects the **depth, power, and meaning** within the divine Ground.
   - The Father, Son, and Spirit symbolize **self-relatedness**, **self-manifestation**, and **self-integration**.
   - The economic Trinity is the historical realization of these ontological relations.
   - "The trinitarian symbols point to the structure of the divine life as it is manifest in revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Substantialist Ontology**
   - Tillich rejects classical **substance metaphysics** in favor of existential ontology.
   - The ontological Trinity is not about three substances but about **relations within the divine life**.
   - The economic Trinity is the **actualization** of these relations in time and history.
   - This approach avoids **tritheism** and **modalism**.
   - "The trinitarian doctrine must be interpreted in terms of existential and relational categories." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Unity of Ontological and Economic Trinity**
   - The ontological and economic Trinity are **inseparable** in Tillich’s thought.
   - The economic Trinity is the **manifestation** of the ontological Trinity in the world.
   - Revelation is the point where the **eternal** and the **temporal** intersect.
   - The unity of the Trinity preserves the **dynamic** and **living** character of God.
   - "The economic Trinity is the appearance of the ontological Trinity in the process of history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Trinity and Existential Revelation**
   - The Trinity is a **symbolic expression** of existential revelation.
   - The economic Trinity is experienced in the **event of revelation** and salvation.
   - The ontological Trinity grounds the possibility of **personal encounter** with God.
   - Trinitarian doctrine serves the existential needs of faith, not metaphysical speculation.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity is meaningful only as it expresses the existential revelation of God to man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to the **ontological and economic Trinity** has influenced modern theology by reframing Trinitarian doctrine in existential and symbolic terms. His emphasis on the **Ground of Being** and the dynamic, relational character of the Trinity challenged traditional metaphysical categories and encouraged dialogue with philosophy and culture. While some critics argue that his symbolic interpretation risks undermining classical orthodoxy, Tillich’s work remains a significant resource for theologians seeking to articulate the Trinity in contemporary contexts.
