# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner distinguished between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal being as Father, Son, and Spirit) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s self-revelation and work in salvation history), but he prioritized the latter as the true ground of Christian knowledge of God. Brunner was skeptical of speculative metaphysics and insisted that the **Trinitarian revelation** is accessible only through God’s acts in history, not through abstract essence. For Brunner, the doctrine of the Trinity is rooted in the **encounter with God in Christ**, rather than in philosophical reflection on divine substance.

- "We know the Trinity only because we know the God who reveals Himself as Father, Son, and Spirit in the history of salvation." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation over metaphysics**
   - Brunner rejects speculative accounts of the **ontological Trinity** apart from revelation.
   - He insists that knowledge of God is grounded in **God’s self-disclosure** in history.
   - The Trinity is not a philosophical puzzle but a reality encountered in **divine action**.
   - The economic Trinity is the only legitimate basis for Trinitarian doctrine.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a metaphysical speculation, but a confession of faith in the God who acts." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Christocentric approach to the Trinity**
   - Brunner centers the doctrine of God on the revelation in **Jesus Christ**.
   - The relationship between Father, Son, and Spirit is known through the work of Christ.
   - The **economic Trinity** is the starting point for all theological reflection.
   - The ontological distinctions are meaningful only as they are revealed in Christ.
   - "All our knowledge of God as Trinity is mediated through Christ." (The Mediator)

3. **Cautious affirmation of the ontological Trinity**
   - Brunner affirms the eternal distinctions within God but with reservation.
   - He warns against projecting human categories onto the divine being.
   - The **immanent Trinity** is confessed, not explained.
   - The mystery of God’s being remains beyond human comprehension.
   - "We must not try to look behind the revelation to speculate about the divine essence." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

4. **Personal encounter and relationality**
   - Brunner emphasizes the **personal** nature of God’s self-revelation.
   - The Trinity is experienced in the believer’s relationship with God.
   - The doctrine expresses the dynamic, relational character of God.
   - The focus is on encounter, not abstract substance.
   - "God is not a concept, but the living One who meets us as Father, Son, and Spirit." (Truth as Encounter)

5. **Critique of classical Trinitarian metaphysics**
   - Brunner critiques the influence of Greek metaphysics on Trinitarian doctrine.
   - He argues that traditional formulations often obscure the biblical witness.
   - The language of **substance** and **person** must be subordinated to revelation.
   - The Trinity is a mystery to be confessed, not a problem to be solved.
   - "The Trinity is not a logical construction, but the expression of the living God’s self-giving." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s emphasis on the **economic Trinity** and his suspicion of speculative metaphysics influenced 20th-century Protestant theology, especially in the context of **dialectical theology**. His work contributed to renewed focus on revelation and the relational character of God, challenging classical formulations that prioritized the **ontological Trinity**. While sometimes criticized for downplaying the eternal distinctions within God, Brunner’s approach remains significant for discussions on the relationship between God’s being and God’s acts. His legacy endures in debates about the proper grounding of Trinitarian doctrine in revelation rather than abstract philosophy.
