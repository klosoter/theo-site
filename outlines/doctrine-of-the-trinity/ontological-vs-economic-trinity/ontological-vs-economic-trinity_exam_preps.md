### TITLE
One God in Three Persons: Distinguishing and Uniting the Ontological and Economic Trinity

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How to distinguish the **ontological Trinity** from the **economic Trinity** without positing two Trinities or collapsing God’s inner life into his temporal works, thereby safeguarding both **divine simplicity** and the full **revelatory adequacy** of the economy.
- Decisive figures: Athanasius, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Karl Rahner, Karl Barth.
- Traditions: Pro-Nicene patristic theology, Latin Augustinian trinitarianism, medieval scholasticism, Reformation and post-Reformation orthodox trinitarianism, modern theology since Rahner and Barth, analytic and social trinitarian proposals as contemporary pressure points.
- Debates:
  - Internal: relations of origin and **processions**, the role of **Divine simplicity**, the meaning of **appropriations**, the status of **eternal relations of authority**.
  - External: Arian and subordinationist construals, unitarian and Islamic critiques, modern social trinitarianism and process theology, analytic denials of simplicity.
  - Contemporary: Rahner’s Rule and its limits, the “two Trinities” worry, eternal functional subordination, and questions about divine freedom and immutability in light of the economy.
- Defended position: The **ontological Trinity** and the **economic Trinity** are numerically one and the same God, with the economy truly revealing who God is, yet under the conditions of created history and according to the **missions** that manifest but do not constitute the **processions**; the distinctions are real but formal, not between two different Trinities.

### ESSAY
The distinction between the **ontological Trinity** and the **economic Trinity** arose in modern terminology, yet it names a deep and indispensable pattern in classic Christian dogma: the one **triune God** as he is in himself from all eternity, and the same triune God as he is toward us in creation, redemption, and consummation. For Reformed and broader catholic dogmatics formed by the Nicene and pro-Nicene settlement, the central task is to affirm both that the economy truly reveals the triune God and that God’s inner life is not constituted or altered by temporal events. The ontological Trinity is the one simple, immutable God in his eternal **processions** and relations of origin: the Father unbegotten, the Son eternally begotten, and the Spirit eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. The economic Trinity is this very God in his missions and works: the Father sending the Son and the Spirit, the Son incarnate, crucified, risen, and the Spirit poured out on the church. The conceptual challenge is to safeguard the identity of ontological and economic Trinity without erasing the Creator–creature distinction or turning God’s eternal being into a function of the historical drama.

Athanasius of Alexandria, though not using the later terminology, is decisive for fixing the basic grammar that will control this distinction. In his struggle with Arianism, especially in Orations against the Arians and On the Incarnation, Athanasius insists that the Son who appears in the economy is none other than the eternal, consubstantial Son who is from the Father before all ages. His anti-Arian polemic revolves around a refusal to let economic subordination or temporal sending redefine the Son’s eternal being. When Arians pointed to Christ’s ignorance, growth, and obedience as evidence that he is a creature, Athanasius replied that these belong to the assumed human nature, not to the eternal Logos according to his **divine simplicity** and consubstantiality with the Father. In doing so he articulates a crucial principle: economic features that presuppose creaturely conditions must be interpreted through the lens of the ontological Trinity and the incarnation, not used to reconstruct God’s eternal life from below.

An examiner might press: “If the Son is sent and obeys in the economy, does that not indicate a lesser ontological status?” Athanasius’ answer, which provides a template for later orthodoxy, is that mission reflects procession without entailing subordination of essence. The Son is eternally from the Father; therefore he can be temporally sent. But being from the Father does not make him less than the Father, for what is from God is God, as light from light. Economic submission, then, is a function of the assumed humanity in the mediatorial office, not an index of ontological inferiority. Athanasius thereby establishes an early form of the later claim that the **economic Trinity** is the **ontological Trinity** in self-communication, but under the veiling and condescension of the incarnation.

Augustine deepens this pro-Nicene consensus by giving a systematic account of the relation between **processions** and missions in De Trinitate. For Augustine, the Father eternally begets the Son and eternally spirates the Spirit; these **internal processions** are the basis of all divine missions and all temporal operations. The missions are grounded in, and manifest, the eternal relations. The Son’s visible mission in the incarnation and the Spirit’s visible mission at Pentecost, together with their invisible missions in indwelling and sanctification, reveal the eternal Trinity. Yet Augustine refuses to say that God becomes Trinity in the economy or that the relations arise out of the missions. Instead, the missions are the temporal “extension” by which God, who is eternally triune, comes to be known by creatures.

Augustine’s doctrine of **appropriations** is also central here. Because God in his essence is one and simple, all external works are indivisible and common to the three persons. Yet for the sake of theological understanding and scriptural exegesis, certain works are “appropriated” to one person: creation to the Father, wisdom to the Son, love to the Spirit. An examiner might challenge: “Do appropriations not suggest that the economic Trinity does not really match the ontological Trinity, since we attribute certain works to one person which actually belong to all?” Augustine’s careful answer is that appropriations do not introduce ontological differentiation but pedagogical clarity. They presuppose **divine simplicity** and the unity of the external works. The same act of God by which he creates, redeems, and sanctifies is one act of the one God, though it can be contemplated under distinct relations as from the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit. The **ontological Trinity** is one simple essence with three relations of origin; the **economic Trinity** is that same God in his one external operation, unfolded in a manner suitable to finite creatures. Appropriations therefore prevent us from multiplying gods while also preventing us from collapsing the real personal distinctions into indistinct monotheism.

Thomas Aquinas receives Augustine and the broader Latin tradition, sharpening the metaphysical underpinnings of the ontological–economic relation. In the Summa Theologiae, Thomas insists on **divine simplicity**, immutability, and impassibility: in God there is no composition, no real accidents, no change. The persons are distinguished solely by their relations of origin, which are subsistent relations. The Son is the Word eternally spoken by the Father, the Spirit is the Love or Gift proceeding from Father and Son. From this point, Thomas develops a precise account of missions. A divine person is sent when he is made present in a new mode in a rational creature, yet this new mode of presence does not introduce change in God but only in the creature. The mission presupposes the procession: because the Son proceeds as Word, he can be sent to dwell in us by faith; because the Spirit proceeds as Love, he can be sent to us as the indwelling gift of charity.

An objector could say: “If God is simple and immutable, how can he genuinely act in history? Does this not make the economic Trinity a mere appearance, with all motion and relation located only on the creaturely side?” Aquinas’ answer is subtle but crucial for this locus. Because God is pure act, his eternal willing of himself includes in one simple decree the willing of creatures and their histories. The distinction between ontological and economic Trinity is therefore not a distinction in God, as if God had two modes of being, but a distinction in the relation of creatures to God’s one eternal act. The same simple, triune God is Lord of creation and redemption; the economy is the temporal realization of what God eternally wills. The economic Trinity is not an illusion or mere mask. It is God truly acting ad extra, yet that temporal action is the effect of his timeless willing, not an alteration of his being. The missions are the historical expression of the **processions**, and the processions are the inner-trinitarian ground of the missions.

Reformed orthodoxy appropriates this patristic and scholastic inheritance and tightens it within a fully developed doctrine of **federal theology** and Christ’s **mediatorial office**. While not tied to our named decisive figures, this context is important for Westminster examiners because it governs how we read the economy. The Son’s humiliation, obedience, and exaltation are understood primarily according to his office as the second Adam and federal head of the covenant of grace, not as windows into a supposed eternal subordination within the immanent Trinity. This provides a robust dogmatic shield against reading the economic subordination of Christ into the very **ontological Trinity**, an error that has resurfaced in some contemporary evangelical circles under the terminology of eternal functional subordination. Here, classic Reformed theology stands with Athanasius and Augustine: what is economic and mediatorial is determined by incarnation and office, not by the eternal divine processions.

In the twentieth century, Karl Barth and Karl Rahner have become decisive for reframing the discourse. Barth, in the Church Dogmatics, rejects the language of ontological versus economic Trinity as potentially misleading but effectively reconstructs the issue under the heading of God’s self-revelation. For Barth, God’s being is in his act and his act is in his being. The God who reveals himself is the God who is revealed and the God who reveals. Barth thereby assaults any notion of a hidden God behind the God revealed in Christ. When God elects, becomes incarnate, and speaks his Word, this is not an external, accidental role-taking but the triune God being himself. Barth’s famous formula that “the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity” is often cited, though he does not use exactly Rahner’s later phrasing. For Barth, the inner-trinitarian relations are known only through and in God’s saving acts, and these saving acts are fully revelatory of who God eternally is.

An examiner will almost certainly ask: “Does Barth endanger **divine freedom** or metaphysical stability by identifying God’s being with his historical act?” The Reformed critic worries that if God’s being is in his act and the decisive act is the history of Jesus Christ, then God would be ontologically dependent on a contingent history, collapsing the distinction between **ontological Trinity** and **economic Trinity**. Barth wants to avoid this: he insists that God is free in his decision to be God for us and that this decision is eternal, not an afterthought. Yet his strong identification formulas generate debate. A classicist will respond that Barth’s insight into the identity of the one God who acts and who is cannot override the Creator–creature distinction and the distinction between God’s eternal act ad intra and his free decision to create and redeem ad extra. A Reformed position should appreciate Barth’s protest against any “fourth” hidden God lurking behind revelation, yet maintain against him that God’s essential triune life would be what it is even if he had not created or redeemed. Otherwise we risk making God’s very being correlative to the world.

Karl Rahner, in The Trinity and other works, coins the famous “Rahner’s Rule”: “The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity.” Rahner’s intention is to combat a de facto modalism and practical unitarianism in Roman Catholic piety and theology, where the Trinity is largely ignored in favor of a generic monotheism. He insists that the God who really acts in the economy is the triune God, and there is no gap between the “real” God and the “revealed” God. The first half of his rule guards against an unknown God behind the economy: the economic Trinity is nothing other than the immanent Trinity. The second half guards against treating the inner-trinitarian relations as speculative surplus: the immanent Trinity is not something beyond or above what is revealed in the missions of Son and Spirit.

Yet Rahner’s Rule raises hard questions that pierce to the heart of our topic. If the economic Trinity “is” the immanent Trinity, how do we account for the economic features that seem tied to sin and history, such as the cross, dereliction, and glorification? Are these also simply who God is in himself? Does the **ontological Trinity** become cruciform? Rahner himself attempts to safeguard **divine freedom** and transcendence, but his followers often press his language in ways that blur the ontological–economic distinction. Process theologians and some political theologies, for example, speak of God becoming or suffering in himself in and through history, effectively making the economy constitutive of God’s being. Against this, classical trinitarianism must insist that while the missions truly reveal the processions, not every economic feature is directly predicable of the divine nature or inner-trinitarian relations. The cross reveals the love of the triune God and the relations of sender and sent, but it does so through the assumed humanity in the one person of the Son. God does not become passible in his essence.

At this juncture, one must address internal debates within contemporary Reformed and evangelical theology, particularly around eternal functional subordination and social trinitarianism. Advocates of eternal functional subordination appeal to the economic obedience of the Son and the language of sending to argue for an eternal taxis of authority and submission within the **ontological Trinity**. They often appeal to Rahner’s Rule, arguing that if the economic relations of authority and submission do not correspond to the immanent Trinity, then the economy is not truly revelatory of God. The classical response, drawing on Athanasius, Augustine, and Thomas, is that correspondence is analogical, not univocal. The economy does reveal the ontological Trinity, but through the medium of the incarnation and the pactum salutis. Thus the Son’s mediatorial obedience manifests his eternal sonship, but does not map straightforwardly onto an eternal submission of will. The Son’s will is numerically one divine will; his obedience is according to his human nature and office.

Similarly, social trinitarians, influenced by modern personalism and often drawing on Barth and Rahner, argue that the Trinity should be construed as three centers of consciousness in perichoretic communion, with the economic cooperation and mutual love among Father, Son, and Spirit reflecting and constituting a social ontology within God. Here the danger is to project creaturely patterns of society back into the **ontological Trinity**, or to use the economy as a direct anthropological model for politics and community. Classical theism responds that while perichoretic communion is real, **divine simplicity** and numerical identity of essence forbid construing the three as three subjects of consciousness in the way human persons are. The economic narratives of mutual sending and glorifying truly reflect eternal relations of origin and love, but they do so on the stage of salvation history where human and created mediations shape the form of revelation.

External critiques also abound. Unitarian and Islamic theologians argue that the ontological Trinity is speculative and incoherent, and that the economic Trinity is simply the story of a prophet or created mediator elevated to divine status by later dogma. They often attack the distinction itself as a way of immunizing trinitarianism from falsification: any dissonance between economic appearances and ontological claims is blamed on mystery or hiddenness. The orthodox reply is that the ontological Trinity was not a later philosophical accretion but the necessary inference from the biblical economy rightly understood. The New Testament forces us to say that the one God of Israel acts as Father speaking in the Son and pouring out the Spirit, and that the Son and Spirit bear divine names, attributes, and operations while being personally distinct from the Father. The distinction between ontological and economic Trinity is not a retreat into hiddenness but a disciplined way of saying that the same God who acts in Jesus Christ and sends the Spirit is eternally Father, Son, and Spirit, and that the economy is the means by which we come to know the eternal God in a way suited to creatures.

At the same time, classical orthodoxy resists any suggestion that we possess a univocal blueprint of God’s inner life directly from the economy. Our knowledge is **analogical knowledge**: true but proportioned to finite creatures, governed by revelation, and disciplined by the rule that what is said of God must not contradict his unity, simplicity, and aseity. Thus, when examiners ask whether the ontological Trinity and economic Trinity are “identical” or “different,” the best answer is to say that they are identical as to the subject, numerically the same triune God, yet distinct as to mode of consideration. The distinction is formal, not real, existing on the side of our knowledge and of God’s relation to creatures, not as two states of God. To deny this distinction collapses God into history; to harden it into two Trinities fractures revelation from reality.

This ontological–economic relation cannot be isolated from adjacent loci. In Christology, the communication of idioms ensures that what is done and suffered in the humanity of Christ is predicated of the person of the Son, who is consubstantial with the Father. The economy thus truly reveals the eternal Son, yet always through the hypostatic union. In soteriology, union with Christ and the gift of the Spirit mean that the missions bring us into fellowship with the triune God as he is in himself, not with a mere role-playing deity. In the doctrine of Scripture, the inspiration of the Spirit and the centrality of the Son as the interpretive key mean that the biblical economy is the authoritative medium by which we know the ontological Trinity, though never exhaustively.

The position to be defended, therefore, is that the **ontological Trinity** and the **economic Trinity** are not two Trinities but one and the same triune God, identical in subject and attributes, distinguished only in that the former names God’s eternal, necessary being ad intra and the latter names his free, temporal self-communication ad extra. The economy truly reveals God as he is, because the missions express the processions. Yet the economy does not constitute God as triune, nor do all economic features map univocally onto God’s eternal life. This position secures **divine simplicity**, immutability, and freedom, while avoiding the specter of a hidden God behind revelation. It appropriates Athanasius’ insistence that the Son who saves is the eternal Son, Augustine’s account of missions and appropriations, Thomas’s metaphysical clarity about processions and missions, and the legitimate insight of Barth and Rahner that God is indeed as he reveals himself, without surrendering the classical distinction between God’s necessary inner being and his contingent external works.

An examiner may conclude by probing: “If the economic Trinity is revelatory but not constitutive, are we then left in apophatic agnosticism?” The answer, following the catholic and Reformed tradition, is no. We truly know God, not merely his effects, for in the Son and Spirit he gives us himself. Yet we know him **analogically** and under the veil of the economy, never comprehending his essence. The ontological–economic distinction is thus not an evasion but a confession of both God’s self-giving and his incomprehensible majesty.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The **ontological Trinity** is the one simple, eternal God in his inner **processions** and relations of origin; the **economic Trinity** is this same triune God in his free, temporal missions and works ad extra, the distinction being formal on the side of relation and our knowing, not a division into two Trinities.
- Decisive figures:
  - Athanasius: Linked the economic Christ to the eternal, consubstantial Son, resisting any use of economic subordination to deny full deity.
  - Augustine: Grounded missions in **processions**, unified external works, and used **appropriations** to relate the economic to the ontological Trinity.
  - Thomas Aquinas: Clarified **divine simplicity**, immutability, and the notion of missions as new modes of presence without change in God, securing the ontological–economic relation.
  - Karl Barth: Stressed the identity of God’s being and act, pressing against any gap between revealed and real God, yet raising questions about divine freedom and aseity.
  - Karl Rahner: Formulated Rahner’s Rule, insisting that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa, combating practical unitarianism but tempting some to collapse ontology into economy.
- Debates:
  - Internal: How missions manifest **processions**; the legitimacy and limits of **appropriations**; whether to affirm eternal functional subordination; how strictly to articulate **divine simplicity** in trinitarian terms.
  - External: Arian and subordinationist readings of the economy; unitarian and Islamic critiques of the ontological Trinity as speculative; social trinitarian and process accounts that make the economy constitutive of God.
  - Contemporary: Interpretation and scope of Rahner’s Rule; the “two Trinities” worry; social trinitarianism as political model; eternal functional subordination vs classical Reformed Christology; divine freedom and immutability under historical revelation.
- Defended position: The **ontological** and **economic Trinity** are numerically the same triune God; the economy truly and analogically reveals God’s inner life because missions manifest processions, yet God’s triune being is not constituted or altered by the economy; the distinction is real in relation and knowledge, not a division in God.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - “Are there two Trinities?” One triune God only; the distinction is between God ad intra and ad extra, not between two realities.
  - “How do missions relate to processions?” Missions manifest and presuppose processions; a person is sent because he proceeds.
  - “Does Rahner’s Rule overturn the ontological–economic distinction?” Properly qualified, it guards identity of God in revelation and in himself but must not be used to make the economy constitutive of God’s being.
  - “Does the Son’s economic obedience imply eternal subordination?” No; it belongs to his human nature and mediatorial office, though it reflects his eternal sonship.
  - “How is **divine simplicity** compatible with real personal distinctions and economic differentiation?” Simplicity concerns essence and attributes; persons are distinct by subsistent relations of origin, and all external works are of the one simple God, though revealed through distinct missions.
