# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann addressed the **doctrine of the Trinity** through his method of **demythologization**, insisting that the Trinity is meaningful only as it relates to the existential encounter with God in **Jesus Christ** and the **Spirit** as proclaimed in the kerygma. He rejected the **ontological Trinity** of classical dogmatics, focusing instead on the **economic Trinity** as experienced in the life of faith.

- "We can know nothing of a pre-existent Son of God except that which is revealed in the event of Christ." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)
- Essays Philosophical and Theological

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Trinitarian Language**
    - Interprets Trinitarian terms existentially rather than metaphysically.
    - Argues that the **ontological Trinity** is not accessible or meaningful for modern faith.
    - Focuses on the proclamation (**kerygma**) rather than speculative doctrine.
    - Sees the Trinity as expressing the encounter with God in Christ and Spirit.
    "The real meaning of the doctrine is to be found in the experience of salvation, not in metaphysical speculation." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Primacy of the Economic Trinity**
    - God is known through His actions in history, not through eternal relations.
    - The **economic Trinity** is the self-revelation of God in Christ and the Spirit.
    - The New Testament presents God as Father, Son, and Spirit within salvation history.
    - Emphasizes God's address to the believer rather than divine ontology.
    "The New Testament knows nothing of a metaphysical Trinity, but only of the God who acts in Christ and the Spirit." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Christology as Existential Encounter**
    - Jesus is the locus of God's self-revelation, not a pre-existent divine person.
    - The meaning of Christ is found in the existential call to faith.
    - The **Son** is not a metaphysical category but a proclamation event.
    - The Trinity is meaningful only as it relates to the believer's response.
    "Christology is not a doctrine about a divine being, but a proclamation of the event in which God encounters us." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Spirit as Present Reality, Not Hypostasis**
    - The **Spirit** is the power of new life experienced in faith.
    - The Spirit is not a distinct person within the Godhead.
    - The work of the Spirit is inseparable from the proclamation of Christ.
    - The Trinity expresses the dynamic presence of God, not ontological distinctions.
    "The Spirit is the power of God’s word as it addresses us here and now." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Rejection of Speculative Metaphysics**
    - Rejects classical metaphysical formulations of the Trinity.
    - Values the doctrine only insofar as it expresses existential truth.
    - Argues the **ontological Trinity** is a product of Hellenistic thought, not biblical revelation.
    - Faith is oriented toward the event of God's self-giving, not eternal divine relations.
    "The problem of the Trinity arises only when the biblical message is interpreted in terms of Greek metaphysics." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **Trinity** has significantly shaped modern theology’s focus on the **economic Trinity** and the existential dimension of Christian faith. By prioritizing proclamation and experience over metaphysical speculation, he challenged traditional formulations and influenced subsequent debates on the relevance of the **ontological Trinity**. His legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the relationship between biblical revelation and doctrinal development, especially within existential and hermeneutical theology.
