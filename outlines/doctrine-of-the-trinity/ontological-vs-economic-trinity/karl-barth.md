# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s doctrine of the **Trinity** is foundational for his entire theological project, emphasizing the inseparability of the **ontological Trinity** (God in Himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s self-revelation in history). Barth insists that we know the triune God only through His **self-revelation** in Jesus Christ, and thus the economic Trinity is the mode by which the ontological Trinity is made known, without collapsing one into the other.

- "The revelation of God is identical with God Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Basis for Trinitarian Knowledge**
    - All knowledge of the **Trinity** is grounded in God’s self-revelation, not human speculation.
    - The **economic Trinity** is the only access point to the **ontological Trinity**.
    - Revelation is a personal event in Jesus Christ, not a static deposit.
    - The triune God reveals Himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the history of salvation.
    - "God reveals Himself. He reveals Himself through Himself. He reveals Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Unity of Ontological and Economic Trinity**
    - Barth rejects any separation between the **immanent** (ontological) and **economic Trinity**.
    - The God who acts in history is the same God who exists eternally as Trinity.
    - The economic Trinity is truly the ontological Trinity in action, not a mere appearance.
    - There is no “hidden God” behind the God revealed in Christ.
    - "The God who reveals Himself is the God who is." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **Christocentric Trinitarianism**
    - Jesus Christ is the center and content of all Trinitarian revelation.
    - The **Son** is both the Revealer and the Revealed, mediating knowledge of the Father and Spirit.
    - The doctrine of the Trinity is inseparable from the doctrine of **reconciliation**.
    - The triune God is known only in and through the person and work of Christ.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is what basically distinguishes the Christian doctrine of God as Christian." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

4. **Rejection of Subordinationism**
    - All three persons of the Trinity are fully and equally God.
    - There is no ontological hierarchy among Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - The distinctions among the persons are relational, not substantial.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit reflect their eternal relations, not inferiority.
    - "In God Himself there is neither a first nor a last, neither a more nor a less." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

5. **Doctrine of Modes of Being (Seinsweisen)**
    - Barth uses the term **modes of being** to describe the distinctions within the Trinity.
    - The one God exists eternally as three distinct modes of being: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - This language avoids tritheism while affirming real distinctions.
    - The modes of being are not mere roles or manifestations, but eternal realities.
    - "God is One in three distinctive modes of being, and He is three in the unity of His being." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s robust articulation of the **unity of the ontological and economic Trinity** has profoundly shaped modern Trinitarian theology, especially in the Reformed tradition. His insistence that God is known only through His self-revelation in Christ has influenced both Protestant and Catholic theologians. Barth’s rejection of speculation apart from revelation and his Christocentric approach continue to be central points of reference in contemporary discussions of the doctrine of God. His work remains a touchstone for debates on the relationship between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.
