# John Zizioulas (1931–2023)

John Zizioulas is renowned for his distinctive approach to the **Trinity**, emphasizing the relational and personal character of divine existence. He draws a strong distinction between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal being as communion of persons) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s self-revelation in history), arguing that the latter is grounded in the former and that **personhood** is the fundamental category for understanding both.

- "The being of God is relational being; without the concept of communion it would not be possible to speak of the being of God." (Being as Communion)

## Key Works

- Being as Communion: Studies in Personhood and the Church (1985)
- Communion and Otherness: Further Studies in Personhood and the Church (2006)
- Lectures on Christian Dogmatics (2008)
- "The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity: The Significance of the Cappadocian Contribution" (in various collections)
- "Communion and Otherness: The Unity and Diversity of the Trinity" (various essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Personhood as Ontological Principle**
   - The **Father** is the source of the Trinity, establishing personhood as the foundation of divine being.
   - The **ontological Trinity** is defined by the eternal relationships of Father, Son, and Spirit.
   - Personhood is not secondary to substance; it is constitutive of divine existence.
   - The divine unity is a unity of persons in communion, not of abstract essence.
   - "The person, not the substance, constitutes the ultimate ontological category." (Being as Communion)

2. **Distinction and Unity of Ontological and Economic Trinity**
   - The **ontological Trinity** refers to God’s eternal, internal life.
   - The **economic Trinity** is God’s manifestation in creation and redemption.
   - The economic Trinity reveals but does not exhaust the mystery of the ontological Trinity.
   - The two are inseparable but must be distinguished to avoid modalism or subordinationism.
   - "The economic Trinity presupposes and reveals the ontological Trinity, but does not define it." (Communion and Otherness)

3. **Relational Ontology**
   - Being is constituted by **communion**; there is no being without relationship.
   - The Trinity is the archetype of all relational existence.
   - The distinction of persons is maintained without division of essence.
   - Human personhood finds its ground and fulfillment in the relational being of God.
   - "Communion is an ontological category, not simply a moral or psychological one." (Being as Communion)

4. **Cappadocian Influence**
   - Zizioulas draws heavily on the **Cappadocian Fathers** for his trinitarian theology.
   - The Cappadocians emphasized the monarchy of the Father and the relationality of the divine persons.
   - Their insights allow for a robust distinction between **hypostasis** and **ousia**.
   - This patristic framework undergirds Zizioulas’s distinction between ontological and economic Trinity.
   - "The Cappadocians made it possible to speak of God as communion without dissolving the unity of God." (Being as Communion)

5. **Ecclesial Implications**
   - The Church mirrors the **Trinitarian communion** in its own life and structure.
   - Ecclesiology is grounded in the ontological reality of the Trinity.
   - The unity and diversity of the Church reflect the unity and diversity of the divine persons.
   - Participation in the life of the Trinity is realized through sacramental and communal life.
   - "The Church is an image of the Trinity because it is a communion of persons." (Being as Communion)

## Legacy and Impact

Zizioulas’s trinitarian theology has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **personhood**, **communion**, and the relationship between the **ontological** and **economic Trinity**. His retrieval of patristic sources, especially the Cappadocians, has revitalized Eastern Orthodox contributions to systematic theology. By grounding ecclesiology and anthropology in the relational being of God, Zizioulas has influenced ecumenical dialogue and the broader field of **systematic theology**. His work continues to provoke debate on the nature of divine unity and the significance of personhood for both theology and the life of the Church.
