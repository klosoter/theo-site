# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner is renowned for his influential articulation of the relationship between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s inner life) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s self-revelation in history). He famously asserted the essential unity between these two, insisting that what God reveals in salvation history truly corresponds to God’s eternal being. Rahner’s approach challenged traditional distinctions and shaped modern discussions of **Trinitarian theology**.

- "The 'economic' Trinity is the 'immanent' Trinity and the 'immanent' Trinity is the 'economic' Trinity." (The Trinity)

## Key Works

- The Trinity (1970)
- Foundations of Christian Faith (1976)
- Theological Investigations, Vol. I: God, Christ, Mary and Grace
- Hearer of the Word (1941)
- "Remarks on the Dogmatic Treatise 'De Trinitate'" in Theological Investigations, Vol. IV

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Ontological and Economic Trinity**
    - Rejects a strict separation between God’s eternal being and God’s actions in history.
    - Argues that God’s self-communication in salvation history is a true revelation of God’s inner life.
    - Maintains that the **economic Trinity** is not merely a temporal mask but reveals the real **ontological Trinity**.
    - Sees the doctrine as vital for understanding the reality of **revelation**.
    - "The 'economic' Trinity is the 'immanent' Trinity and vice versa." (The Trinity)

2. **Primacy of Revelation**
    - Emphasizes that all knowledge of the Trinity comes through God’s self-revelation in history.
    - Holds that human experience of salvation is the basis for understanding the Trinity.
    - Asserts that speculative theology must be grounded in the economy of salvation.
    - Views **revelation** as both the source and norm for Trinitarian doctrine.
    - "We have no access to the immanent Trinity except through the economic Trinity." (The Trinity)

3. **Rejection of Mere Modalism**
    - Insists that the economic Trinity is not simply a set of modes or roles.
    - Affirms the real distinction of **Persons** within the one God.
    - Argues that the historical missions of the Son and Spirit reflect true distinctions in God’s eternal being.
    - Avoids reducing the Trinity to functional manifestations.
    - "The economic self-communication of God is not a mere appearance." (The Trinity)

4. **Anthropological Orientation**
    - Connects Trinitarian doctrine to human experience of grace and salvation.
    - Sees the Trinity as foundational for understanding the human relationship with God.
    - Emphasizes the existential dimension of encountering the Triune God.
    - Integrates **Trinitarian theology** with his broader theological anthropology.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not an abstract speculation but a truth of salvation." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Pastoral and Ecumenical Sensitivity**
    - Seeks to make Trinitarian doctrine accessible and relevant for the church.
    - Engages with both Catholic tradition and Protestant concerns.
    - Aims to overcome the practical neglect of the Trinity in Christian life.
    - Encourages renewed liturgical and spiritual focus on the Triune God.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity must become a living reality for Christians." (The Trinity)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s formulation of the **Rahnerian axiom**—the identity of the economic and ontological Trinity—has become a central reference point in contemporary Trinitarian theology. His work prompted renewed attention to the relationship between God’s eternal being and historical revelation, influencing both Catholic and Protestant thought. Rahner’s approach has shaped ecumenical dialogue and inspired further exploration of the **doctrine of the Trinity** as foundational for Christian faith and practice.
