# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirmed the **unity of the divine essence** and the **distinction of persons** within the **Trinity**, carefully distinguishing between the **ontological Trinity** (God as He is in Himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God as He reveals Himself in redemptive history). Calvin insisted that the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** are coequal and consubstantial, yet their personal distinctions are revealed in their **relations of origin** and their roles in **salvation**.

- "For in each hypostasis the whole divine nature is understood, and the only difference is in the mutual relations." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, I.13.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 13–14)
- Commentary on the Gospel of John
- Catechism of the Church of Geneva
- Sermons on the Deity of Christ
- Theological Treatises (selected letters and tracts)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Essence, Distinction of Persons**
    - The **one divine essence** is fully possessed by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - The **distinctions** among the persons are real but do not divide the substance.
    - The persons are distinguished by their **relations of origin**: the Father unbegotten, the Son begotten, the Spirit proceeding.
    - Calvin rejects any **subordinationism** within the Trinity.
    - "We, indeed, say that the distinction is a real one, but does not imply a division." (Institutes I.13.2)

2. **Ontological Trinity: Immanent Relations**
    - The **ontological Trinity** refers to God’s eternal existence as three persons.
    - The personal properties are not merely roles but are intrinsic to each person.
    - The Son is eternally begotten, and the Spirit eternally proceeds, apart from creation.
    - These distinctions are not dependent on God’s works in history.
    - "We must observe the distinction, so as not to confound the persons, nor to divide the essence." (Institutes I.13.17)

3. **Economic Trinity: Revelation in Redemptive History**
    - The **economic Trinity** concerns how God reveals Himself in the work of **creation and redemption**.
    - The Father sends the Son, and the Father and Son send the Spirit.
    - The roles in salvation history reflect, but do not exhaust, the eternal distinctions.
    - The economic actions are always the work of the whole Trinity, though appropriated to one person.
    - "The Father is called the Author, the Son the Wisdom, and the Spirit the Power, yet the whole work belongs equally to the one God." (Institutes I.13.18)

4. **Guarding Against Modalism and Tritheism**
    - Calvin opposes **modalism**, which denies real personal distinctions.
    - He also rejects **tritheism**, which divides the Godhead into three gods.
    - The **names** Father, Son, and Spirit are not mere titles or modes, but real persons.
    - The unity of essence ensures monotheism, while the distinction of persons preserves the Trinity.
    - "Let us not imagine three Gods, but rather three persons in one essence." (Institutes I.13.16)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Calvin grounds his doctrine in the **progressive revelation** of Scripture.
    - He emphasizes the clarity of the New Testament in revealing the Trinity.
    - The Old Testament contains **veiled references** to the Trinity, fully unveiled in Christ.
    - The doctrine is not a philosophical speculation but a biblical truth.
    - "Scripture speaks thus: there are three persons in one essence." (Institutes I.13.20)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s careful articulation of the **ontological and economic Trinity** shaped subsequent **Reformed theology**, providing a framework that balanced the unity and diversity within the Godhead. His insistence on the **biblical foundation** for Trinitarian doctrine influenced confessional standards and catechisms throughout the Reformed tradition. Calvin’s approach remains a touchstone for discussions on the Trinity, especially in guarding against both **modalism** and **tritheism**. His legacy endures in the ongoing theological emphasis on the inseparable operations of the triune God in both being and action.
