# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield offered a rigorous defense of the **Trinity**, emphasizing the distinction between the **ontological Trinity** (God as He is in Himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God as He reveals Himself in history). He insisted that all Trinitarian doctrine must be grounded in **Scripture**, and that the unity and equality of the divine persons are essential to orthodox Christianity.

- "The Trinity is not merely an economic, but an ontological fact." ("Biblical Doctrines")

## Key Works

- "Biblical Doctrines" (especially the essay "The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity")
- "The Person and Work of Christ"
- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"
- "Calvin and Calvinism"
- "The Idea of Systematic Theology"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Trinity: Eternal Distinctions**
    - The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinguished by **eternal relations of origin**: begetting, begotten, and proceeding.
    - These distinctions are intrinsic to the Godhead and not dependent on creation or redemption.
    - Warfield rejects any notion of subordination in **essence** among the persons.
    - The unity of **divine essence** is absolute and indivisible.
    "The distinctions in the Trinity are not temporal but eternal." ("Biblical Doctrines")

2. **Economic Trinity: Revelation in History**
    - The economic Trinity refers to the roles the persons assume in **creation, redemption, and sanctification**.
    - These roles are the historical outworking of the eternal relations, not arbitrary assignments.
    - The economic distinctions do not imply inferiority or superiority among the persons.
    - Warfield insists that the economic Trinity reveals, but does not constitute, the ontological Trinity.
    "The revelation of the Trinity in redemption is grounded in the eternal being of God." ("Biblical Doctrines")

3. **Unity of Essence and Equality of Persons**
    - All three persons share the same **divine essence** and attributes.
    - There is no gradation of deity or power among the persons.
    - The distinctions are of person, not of nature or substance.
    - Warfield upholds the **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** formulations as faithful expressions of biblical truth.
    "There is but one God, and the Father, Son, and Spirit are each that one God." ("Biblical Doctrines")

4. **Rejection of Modalism and Subordinationism**
    - Warfield opposes any view that collapses the persons into mere modes or manifestations.
    - He also rejects any form of ontological subordination within the Trinity.
    - The persons are co-equal and co-eternal, each fully God.
    - The economic roles do not reflect differences in essence or value.
    "The doctrine of the Trinity safeguards both the unity and the diversity of the Godhead." ("Biblical Doctrines")

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Distinctions**
    - Warfield grounds both ontological and economic distinctions in **biblical revelation**.
    - He argues that the New Testament reveals the Trinity most fully, especially in the context of redemption.
    - The economic missions of the Son and Spirit are rooted in their eternal relations to the Father.
    - Scripture, not speculative philosophy, is the ultimate authority for Trinitarian doctrine.
    "The doctrine of the Trinity is given to us in Scripture, not in creeds or confessions." ("Biblical Doctrines")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s careful articulation of the **ontological and economic Trinity** has shaped Reformed and evangelical theology, providing a robust framework for understanding unity and diversity within the Godhead. His insistence on the equality of the divine persons and the grounding of Trinitarian distinctions in **Scripture** has influenced generations of systematic theologians. Warfield’s legacy endures in the ongoing defense of orthodox Trinitarianism against both ancient and modern errors.
