# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—affirm the classical distinction between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal being as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s self-revelation and work in creation and redemption). These confessions uphold the **unity of essence** and **distinction of persons** within the Godhead, while emphasizing that the divine persons act inseparably in the works of salvation. The Three Forms maintain that the **order of operations** in redemption reflects, but does not compromise, the eternal relations within the Trinity.

- "In this one only Godhead there are three persons, distinguished by their properties, namely, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Divine Essence**
    - God is one in **essence**, undivided and eternal.
    - The three persons share the same divine substance.
    - The unity of God is foundational to all Trinitarian doctrine.
    - Any distinction among persons does not divide the essence.
    - "We believe in one only God, who is one single essence, in which are three persons." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

2. **Distinction of Persons**
    - The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are truly and eternally distinct.
    - Each person is identified by unique **personal properties** (unbegotten, begotten, proceeding).
    - The distinctions are not merely modes or roles, but real and eternal.
    - The persons are not confused or mixed, preserving true distinction.
    - "The Father is the cause, origin, and beginning of all things visible and invisible; the Son is the Word, wisdom, and image of the Father; the Holy Ghost is the eternal power and might." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

3. **Ontological Trinity: Eternal Relations**
    - The **ontological Trinity** refers to God as He is in Himself, apart from creation.
    - The relations of origin (begetting, proceeding) are eternal and internal to God.
    - The divine persons are co-equal and co-eternal.
    - The order among the persons does not imply subordination of essence.
    - "The Son is neither made, nor created, but begotten of the Father alone; the Holy Ghost is of the Father and the Son." (Belgic Confession, Art. 10)

4. **Economic Trinity: Divine Works**
    - The **economic Trinity** concerns God’s actions in creation, providence, and redemption.
    - The persons act inseparably, yet each is manifested according to His personal property.
    - The Father sends the Son, and the Father and Son send the Spirit in the work of salvation.
    - The economic order reflects, but does not alter, the eternal relations.
    - "The Father has created us by His power, the Son has redeemed us by His blood, the Holy Ghost sanctifies us by His dwelling in our hearts." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 24)

5. **Inseparable Operations**
    - All external works of God are undivided, performed by the one divine essence.
    - Each person is fully involved in every divine action.
    - The distinction of persons is preserved in the mode of operation, not in division of labor.
    - The unity of operation safeguards the unity of God while honoring personal distinctions.
    - "These three persons, thus distinct, are one only true God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have provided a confessional anchor for the doctrine of the Trinity in the Reformed tradition, shaping the understanding of both the **ontological** and **economic Trinity** for generations. Their careful articulation of the unity and distinction within the Godhead has influenced Reformed theology, catechesis, and worship. By maintaining the classical categories, these confessions have helped guard against both modalism and tritheism, ensuring a robust and orthodox Trinitarianism in Reformed churches worldwide.
