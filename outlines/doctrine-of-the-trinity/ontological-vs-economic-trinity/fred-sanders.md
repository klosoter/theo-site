# Fred Sanders (1968– )

Fred Sanders is a leading contemporary theologian whose work emphasizes the vital distinction and relationship between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal being as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s actions in salvation history). Sanders insists that the **economic missions** of the Son and Spirit reveal, but do not exhaust, the eternal **immanent relations** within the Godhead, and he warns against collapsing one into the other. His approach is marked by a retrieval of **Nicene orthodoxy** and a commitment to grounding all trinitarian reflection in **Scripture**.

- "The missions of the Son and the Spirit are the key to the doctrine of the Trinity, but they are not the whole doctrine." ("The Deep Things of God")

## Key Works

- The Deep Things of God: How the Trinity Changes Everything (2010)
- The Triune God (New Studies in Dogmatics, 2016)
- "The Trinity" in The Oxford Handbook of Systematic Theology (2007)
- "The Trinity Is Not Just for Trinity Sunday" (Christianity Today, 2017)
- Wesley on the Christian Life: The Heart Renewed in Love (2013) [for broader trinitarian themes]

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Ontological and Economic Trinity**
    - Asserts that the **ontological Trinity** refers to God’s eternal, internal life, while the **economic Trinity** concerns God’s actions in creation and redemption.
    - Warns against conflating the two, which can lead to **modalism** or **subordinationism**.
    - Emphasizes that the economic reveals but does not constitute the ontological.
    - Grounds this distinction in the **Nicene tradition** and careful exegesis.
    - "The immanent Trinity is not a fourth person behind the economic Trinity, but the same God known in a different way." (The Deep Things of God)

2. **Scriptural Basis for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Argues that all trinitarian theology must be rooted in **biblical revelation**.
    - Highlights the **missions** of the Son and Spirit as the scriptural pattern for understanding the Trinity.
    - Rejects speculative approaches that go beyond what is revealed in Scripture.
    - Advocates for a **biblically saturated** trinitarianism.
    - "The Trinity is not a doctrine constructed by theologians, but a reality revealed in the gospel." (The Deep Things of God)

3. **Economic Missions Reveal the Immanent Relations**
    - Teaches that the **sending** of the Son and Spirit in history reflects their eternal relations of origin.
    - The **Father’s sending** of the Son and Spirit corresponds to their eternal generation and procession.
    - The economic Trinity is the "window" into the ontological Trinity, not a separate reality.
    - Maintains that the **order of missions** mirrors the **order of processions**.
    - "The missions are the processions given in time." (The Triune God)

4. **Guarding Divine Simplicity and Unity**
    - Upholds the **unity of God** as foundational to trinitarian doctrine.
    - Rejects any suggestion that God’s being is divided between the ontological and economic Trinity.
    - Affirms **divine simplicity**: God is not composed of parts or temporal states.
    - Insists that the three persons are fully and equally God, sharing the same divine essence.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not a compromise with polytheism, but the perfection of monotheism." (The Deep Things of God)

5. **Retrieval of Nicene Orthodoxy**
    - Advocates for a return to the **Nicene and pro-Nicene** categories in trinitarian theology.
    - Critiques modern tendencies to innovate apart from the historic creeds.
    - Emphasizes the enduring value of **homoousios** and the doctrine of eternal generation.
    - Sees the **creedal tradition** as a safeguard against trinitarian error.
    - "Nicene trinitarianism is not a relic, but a living confession for the church today." (The Triune God)

## Legacy and Impact

Fred Sanders has played a pivotal role in the contemporary **trinitarian revival**, especially among evangelical and Reformed theologians. His clear articulation of the **ontological-economic distinction** has helped correct common misunderstandings and fostered a deeper appreciation for classical trinitarian doctrine. Sanders’s work has influenced both academic theology and popular Christian teaching, making the doctrine of the Trinity accessible and vital for the church’s worship and mission. His retrieval of **Nicene orthodoxy** continues to shape discussions on the Trinity in the twenty-first century.
