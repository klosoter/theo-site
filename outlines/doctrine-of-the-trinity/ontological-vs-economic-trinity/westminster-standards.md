# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a classical doctrine of the **Trinity**, carefully distinguishing between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal being as three persons) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s actions in creation and redemption). The Standards uphold the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, while also affirming the distinct roles each person assumes in the **economy of salvation**. This distinction safeguards both the unity of the divine essence and the real personal distinctions within the Godhead.

- "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost." (Westminster Confession of Faith II.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 4–6

- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith (commentary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Trinity: One Essence, Three Persons**
    - God is one in **essence** but exists eternally as three distinct **persons**: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - Each person is fully and equally **God**, sharing the same divine attributes.
    - The distinctions among the persons are not in essence or degree but in **personal properties**.
    - The persons are distinguished by **relations of origin**: the Father unbegotten, the Son begotten, the Spirit proceeding.
    - "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity." (WCF II.3)

2. **Economic Trinity: Distinct Roles in Redemption**
    - The three persons act inseparably in all divine works, yet each assumes distinct roles in the **economy of salvation**.
    - The Father is especially associated with **election** and sending the Son.
    - The Son is sent to accomplish **redemption** through incarnation and atonement.
    - The Holy Spirit applies the benefits of redemption to the elect.
    - "It is the Father who sends, the Son who is sent and redeems, and the Spirit who applies." (WLC Q.8–11)

3. **No Subordination of Essence**
    - The Standards reject any **ontological subordination** among the persons.
    - All three persons are equally **almighty**, **eternal**, and **worthy of worship**.
    - Any subordination is only in terms of **role** or **function** in the economy, not in being.
    - This guards against both **tritheism** and **modalism**.
    - "The Son is of the Father alone, not by creation, nor by any dependence, but by eternal generation." (WLC Q.10)

4. **Personal Properties Distinguish the Persons**
    - The Father is characterized by **paternity** (unbegotten).
    - The Son is characterized by **filiation** (eternally begotten of the Father).
    - The Spirit is characterized by **procession** (proceeding from the Father and the Son).
    - These properties are eternal and do not imply inferiority or division.
    - "The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son, proceeding from both from all eternity." (WLC Q.11)

5. **Unity of Divine Operations**
    - All external works of God (creation, providence, redemption) are **undivided** and performed by the whole Trinity.
    - Each person participates fully in every divine act, though with distinct personal appropriations.
    - The unity of operation reflects the unity of **essence**.
    - The economic distinctions do not compromise the **simplicity** and unity of God.
    - "The works of creation and providence are common to all three persons." (WSC Q.8)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology’s** articulation of the **Trinity**, providing a careful framework for distinguishing the **ontological** and **economic** aspects without confusion or division. Their precise language has influenced confessional documents and catechesis across Presbyterian and Reformed traditions. The Standards’ robust Trinitarianism continues to serve as a bulwark against both ancient and modern errors, ensuring the church’s worship and doctrine remain rooted in the biblical revelation of the triune God.
