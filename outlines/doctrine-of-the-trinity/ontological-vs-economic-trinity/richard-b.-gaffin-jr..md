# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a Reformed theologian who emphasizes the inseparable unity of the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal being as Father, Son, and Spirit) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s self-revelation and work in history). Gaffin insists that while the **immanent** and **economic** distinctions must be maintained, the economic actions of God reveal, but do not exhaustively define, the eternal relations within the Godhead. His approach is marked by a careful avoidance of subordinating the Son or Spirit in the **immanent Trinity**, while affirming the distinct roles in **redemptive history**.

- "The economic Trinity is the ontological Trinity in action." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Tradition" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Trinity and the Gospel" (in The Glory of the Atonement, ed. Hill & Letham)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction without Separation**
    - Maintains a clear distinction between the **ontological** and **economic Trinity**.
    - Argues that the economic Trinity reveals but does not redefine the ontological Trinity.
    - Warns against collapsing the economic into the ontological, which risks modalism.
    - Insists that the eternal relations of the persons are not altered by their historical missions.
    - "The economic Trinity is not a different Trinity from the ontological Trinity." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

2. **Revelation of the Trinity in Redemptive History**
    - Emphasizes that God’s triune nature is disclosed through the acts of redemption.
    - The **incarnation**, **resurrection**, and **Pentecost** are central events revealing the triune God.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit correspond to their eternal relations.
    - Revelation is progressive but always rooted in the eternal being of God.
    - "The history of redemption is the history of the self-revelation of the triune God." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **No Eternal Subordination of the Son**
    - Rejects any notion of ontological subordination within the Trinity.
    - Affirms the full equality and deity of the Son and Spirit with the Father.
    - Economic submission of the Son is voluntary and historical, not eternal.
    - Upholds Nicene orthodoxy regarding the eternal generation of the Son.
    - "The subordination of the Son is functional and redemptive-historical, not ontological." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Scripture as the Norm for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Insists that all Trinitarian distinctions must be grounded in **biblical revelation**.
    - Warns against speculative theology not rooted in exegesis.
    - Highlights the progressive unfolding of the Trinity in the canon.
    - Uses biblical theology to clarify the relationship between the economic and ontological Trinity.
    - "Our doctrine of the Trinity must be shaped by the contours of Scripture itself." ("Biblical Theology and the Westminster Tradition")

5. **Unity of Divine Action**
    - Stresses the inseparability of the persons in all divine works (opera ad extra).
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit act in unity, though with distinct roles.
    - The economic missions reflect, but do not divide, the one will and essence of God.
    - The unity of divine action safeguards against tritheism and modalism.
    - "All the works of God in history are the works of the triune God, undivided yet distinct." ("The Trinity and the Gospel")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s careful articulation of the **ontological** and **economic Trinity** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of **biblical theology** and the doctrine of God. His insistence on grounding Trinitarian distinctions in Scripture has influenced generations of pastors and scholars at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. Gaffin’s work continues to serve as a bulwark against both subordinationism and speculative Trinitarianism, reinforcing the unity and equality of the divine persons in both being and action.
