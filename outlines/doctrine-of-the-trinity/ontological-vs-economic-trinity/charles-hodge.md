# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge distinguished carefully between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal, immanent being as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s self-revelation and work in creation and redemption). He affirmed the **unity of essence** and **distinction of persons** in the Godhead, insisting that the economic roles do not imply any subordination of essence or being within the Trinity.

- "The distinction between the ontological and the economical Trinity is of great importance." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially chapters on the Trinity)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons
- “The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity” (Princeton Review article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Trinity: Unity of Essence**
    - The three persons share one **divine essence**; there is no division in being.
    - The distinctions among Father, Son, and Spirit are real but do not compromise unity.
    - Each person possesses the fullness of the **Godhead**.
    - The ontological Trinity is eternal and necessary, not dependent on creation or redemption.
    - "The three are the same in substance and equal in power and glory." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Economic Trinity: Distinction in Roles**
    - The economic Trinity refers to God’s actions in **creation, redemption, and revelation**.
    - The Father sends, the Son is sent and incarnate, the Spirit applies redemption.
    - These roles are temporal and voluntary, not essential to the divine nature.
    - The economic distinctions reveal, but do not create, the ontological distinctions.
    - "The subordination of the Son to the Father is only official and economical." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Rejection of Ontological Subordination**
    - Hodge denies any **inferiority** or subordination of essence among the persons.
    - Subordination is only in the order of operation, not in being or attributes.
    - The Son and Spirit are fully and equally God with the Father.
    - Any subordination language is interpreted in light of the economic Trinity.
    - "There is no subordination as to essence, only as to mode of subsistence and operation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Distinctions**
    - Hodge grounds the doctrine in **biblical revelation** rather than speculative philosophy.
    - He appeals to both Old and New Testament texts for the plurality and unity of God.
    - The economic Trinity is revealed progressively in redemptive history.
    - The ontological Trinity is inferred from the economic, but not reducible to it.
    - "The Scriptures teach both the unity of God and the trinity of persons." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Safeguarding Orthodox Trinitarianism**
    - Hodge defends the **Nicene** and **Augustinian** formulations of the Trinity.
    - He opposes both **modalism** (denial of real distinctions) and **tritheism** (denial of unity).
    - The distinction between ontological and economic Trinity protects against heresy.
    - Proper understanding preserves the mystery and majesty of the Godhead.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity, as held by the Church, is the only doctrine that does justice to all the facts of Scripture." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s careful distinction between the **ontological** and **economic Trinity** became a standard feature in Reformed systematic theology, shaping generations of Princeton and Westminster theologians. His insistence on the unity of essence and equality of persons provided a robust defense against both subordinationism and modalism. Hodge’s approach continues to influence contemporary discussions on Trinitarian doctrine, especially in debates over the relationship between the immanent and economic Trinity.
