# Lane Tipton (1972– )

Lane Tipton emphasizes the vital distinction and inseparable unity between the **ontological Trinity** (God as He is in Himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God as revealed in redemptive history). He insists that the **personal relations** within the Godhead are foundational for understanding all of **revelation** and **redemption**, and that the economic works of God never compromise or reveal change in the divine essence. Tipton’s approach is deeply informed by **Reformed confessional theology** and the legacy of **Cornelius Van Til**.

- "The ontological Trinity is the absolute precondition for the economic Trinity, and the economic Trinity is the exclusive self-revelation of the ontological Trinity." (The Trinitarian Theology of Cornelius Van Til)

## Key Works

- The Trinitarian Theology of Cornelius Van Til (2014)
- "The Function of Perichoresis and the Divine Incomprehensibility" (WTJ, 2012)
- "The Gospel and Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutics" (in Confident of Better Things, 2011)
- "Van Til and the Trinity" (in Revelation and Reason, 2007)
- Westminster Confession of Faith (as a confessional standard Tipton frequently references)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Trinity as Absolute Foundation**
    - The **ontological Trinity** refers to God’s eternal, immutable being apart from creation.
    - The three persons—Father, Son, and Spirit—subsist in one undivided essence.
    - The **personal properties** (paternity, filiation, spiration) are not derived from God’s works but are intrinsic to His being.
    - Any knowledge of God’s works presupposes this ontological reality.
    - "The ontological Trinity is the absolute precondition for all revelation and redemption." (The Trinitarian Theology of Cornelius Van Til)

2. **Economic Trinity as Self-Revelation**
    - The **economic Trinity** is God’s triune self-disclosure in creation and redemption.
    - All acts of God in history are the acts of the one triune God, revealing but not altering His essence.
    - The economic missions (sending of Son and Spirit) reflect the eternal relations of origin.
    - The economic Trinity is not a lesser or different Trinity, but the ontological Trinity revealed.
    - "The economic Trinity is the exclusive self-revelation of the ontological Trinity." (The Trinitarian Theology of Cornelius Van Til)

3. **Inseparability and Distinction**
    - The ontological and economic Trinity must be distinguished but never separated.
    - The economic Trinity presupposes and reveals the ontological Trinity.
    - There is no access to the ontological Trinity except through the economic.
    - The unity of God’s being and action safeguards against tritheism or modalism.
    - "The distinction is real, but it is a distinction in relation, not in essence." (The Trinitarian Theology of Cornelius Van Til)

4. **Van Til’s Reformed Trinitarianism**
    - Tipton appropriates Van Til’s insistence on the **self-contained ontological Trinity** as the foundation for all thought.
    - The Creator-creature distinction is rooted in the triune God’s aseity.
    - All revelation is analogical, grounded in God’s triune self-existence.
    - The Trinity is not an abstract doctrine but the living God who relates to His people.
    - "Van Til’s doctrine of the Trinity is the heart of his apologetic method." (Van Til and the Trinity)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutics**
    - The economic Trinity is revealed progressively in the history of redemption.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit are grounded in their eternal relations.
    - Scripture’s narrative is the unfolding of the triune God’s plan.
    - The unity of redemptive history reflects the unity of the triune God.
    - "Redemptive history is the history of the triune God’s self-revelation and saving work." (The Gospel and Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutics)

## Legacy and Impact

Lane Tipton has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed trinitarian theology**, especially in the tradition of Westminster Theological Seminary. His careful articulation of the ontological and economic Trinity has reinforced the importance of classical categories while engaging modern challenges. Tipton’s work continues to influence pastors, scholars, and students seeking a robust, confessional understanding of the triune God in both doctrine and redemptive history.
