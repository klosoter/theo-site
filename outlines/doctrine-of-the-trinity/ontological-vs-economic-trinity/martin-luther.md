# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **doctrine of the Trinity** as central to Christian faith, maintaining a distinction between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal being as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s self-revelation and work in salvation history). While he did not systematize Trinitarian doctrine as later theologians did, Luther insisted that the **revelation of God in Christ** is the only sure ground for knowledge of the triune God, and that the **immanent relations** of the Trinity are inseparable from God’s redemptive actions.

- "No one can know God unless God reveals himself, and he reveals himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- The Large Catechism (especially the sections on the Apostles’ Creed)
- The Small Catechism
- Lectures on Galatians
- Sermons on John’s Gospel
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 22: Sermons on the Gospel of St. John

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Faith Rooted in Revelation**
    - God is known only as he reveals himself, primarily in **Jesus Christ**.
    - The **economic Trinity** is the basis for all true knowledge of the **ontological Trinity**.
    - Scripture, not speculative philosophy, is the source for Trinitarian doctrine.
    - The **Creeds** faithfully summarize biblical teaching on the Trinity.
    - "We must learn to know God from his works and word, not from our own thoughts." (Large Catechism)

2. **Unity and Distinction in the Godhead**
    - The three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—are truly distinct yet share one divine essence.
    - The **ontological Trinity** refers to God’s eternal being, not just his actions.
    - The persons are distinguished by their relations, not by substance or will.
    - The unity of God is never compromised by the distinction of persons.
    - "There are not three gods, but one God in three persons." (Small Catechism)

3. **Christocentric Revelation of the Trinity**
    - Christ is the definitive revelation of the triune God.
    - The **economic Trinity** is most clearly seen in the incarnation and redemptive work of Christ.
    - Faith in Christ leads to true knowledge of the Father and the Spirit.
    - The work of the Spirit is to bring believers to Christ and thus to the Father.
    - "Whoever wants to know God must look upon the face of Christ." (Sermons on John’s Gospel)

4. **Rejection of Speculative Trinitarianism**
    - Luther opposes attempts to understand the Trinity apart from God’s self-revelation.
    - He criticizes philosophical speculation about the **immanent Trinity**.
    - The mystery of the Trinity is to be adored, not dissected.
    - True theology is always grounded in the gospel, not abstract reasoning.
    - "Where God is not revealed, there is nothing but speculation and error." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Practical Implications for Worship and Faith**
    - The Trinity is confessed in baptism and worship, shaping Christian identity.
    - The **economic Trinity** grounds assurance of salvation: the Father sends the Son, and the Spirit applies redemption.
    - Trinitarian doctrine is vital for prayer, as believers approach the Father through the Son in the Spirit.
    - The life of the church is participation in the life of the triune God.
    - "We are baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and thus live in communion with the triune God." (Large Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s approach to the **ontological and economic Trinity** influenced later Protestant theology by grounding Trinitarian doctrine in **revelation** rather than speculation. His insistence on the centrality of Christ for knowing the triune God shaped both confessional documents and worship practices. While not a systematic Trinitarian theologian, Luther’s emphasis on the unity of God’s being and action remains foundational for Lutheran and broader Reformation thought. His legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of the Trinity as the heart of Christian faith and life.
