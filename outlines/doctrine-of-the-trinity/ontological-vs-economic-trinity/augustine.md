# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **Trinity** is foundational for distinguishing between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal being) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s actions in history). He insists on the **unity of essence** and **distinction of persons**, arguing that the divine persons are equal in substance but revealed in different roles through salvation history. Augustine’s careful articulation of these distinctions shaped Western understanding of **Trinitarian relations**.

- "For the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one, and this one is a Trinity." (De Trinitate I.7)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Confessiones (Confessions)
- Enchiridion
- Sermons and Letters (selected, esp. on Trinitarian themes)
- The City of God (relevant sections)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Essence in the Ontological Trinity**
    - The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit share the same **divine substance**.
    - There is no hierarchy of being among the persons.
    - The **ontological Trinity** refers to God as He is in Himself, eternally.
    - Distinctions among persons do not divide the divine essence.
    - "They are not three gods, but one God." (De Trinitate VII.11)

2. **Distinction of Persons**
    - Each person is fully God, yet personally distinct: **Father**, **Son**, and **Holy Spirit**.
    - Distinctions are based on relations of origin (begetting, being begotten, proceeding).
    - The persons are not modes or parts of God.
    - The **personal properties** are eternal and immutable.
    - "The Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit, and yet they are not three substances, but one." (De Trinitate VII.4)

3. **Economic Trinity Reveals the Ontological Trinity**
    - God’s actions in history (creation, redemption, sanctification) reveal the persons.
    - The **missions** of the Son and Spirit correspond to their eternal relations.
    - The economic Trinity does not imply subordination or inferiority.
    - The **revelation** of the Trinity is accommodated to human understanding.
    - "The sending of the Son and the Holy Spirit reveals what is eternal in God." (De Trinitate II.9)

4. **Analogies for Understanding the Trinity**
    - Augustine uses psychological analogies (memory, understanding, will) to explain the Trinity.
    - Analogies help grasp unity and distinction without division.
    - Human mind reflects the image of the triune God.
    - Analogies are limited and cannot fully comprehend the divine mystery.
    - "Let us seek as if to find, and find as if to seek still." (De Trinitate IX.1)

5. **Safeguarding Divine Simplicity**
    - The divine essence is simple, not composite.
    - Distinctions of persons do not compromise **divine simplicity**.
    - All divine attributes are shared equally by each person.
    - Simplicity ensures that God’s being is not divided by the distinctions.
    - "In God, to be is the same as to be wise, or powerful, or just, or whatever else can be said of that simple multiplicity, or that multiple simplicity." (De Trinitate VI.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **ontological and economic Trinity** profoundly shaped Western theology, especially in the Latin tradition. His emphasis on the unity of essence and relational distinctions became a standard for later **Reformed** and **Catholic** thought. Augustine’s psychological analogies and careful distinctions influenced theologians such as Aquinas, Calvin, and the Reformers, ensuring his enduring significance in Trinitarian doctrine.
