# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til’s approach to the **ontological** and **economic Trinity** is rooted in his commitment to the absolute **self-sufficiency** and **unity-in-diversity** of the triune God. He insists that the distinction between God’s **immanent being** (ontological Trinity) and His **historical revelation** (economic Trinity) must never compromise the **equal ultimacy** of the one and the many within the Godhead, which grounds all Christian theology and epistemology.

- "The ontological Trinity is the presupposition of all predication." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Personality of the Ontological Trinity**
    - God’s being is eternally personal, not an abstract principle.
    - The three persons are equally ultimate in the Godhead.
    - The ontological Trinity is the necessary presupposition for all reality and knowledge.
    - God is not dependent on creation for His self-definition.
    - "God is a concrete, absolute self-conscious tri-personality." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Unity and Diversity in the Godhead**
    - The one and the many are equally ultimate in God.
    - The ontological Trinity provides the solution to the philosophical problem of unity and diversity.
    - No person of the Trinity is subordinate in essence.
    - The economic distinctions do not undermine ontological equality.
    - "In God, the one and the many are equally ultimate." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Distinction Without Separation**
    - The ontological and economic Trinity are distinct but inseparable.
    - God’s actions in history reveal, but do not alter, His eternal being.
    - The economic Trinity is the outworking of the ontological Trinity.
    - Revelation is always consistent with God’s eternal nature.
    - "The economic Trinity is the ontological Trinity coming to expression in history." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Revelation and the Trinity**
    - All revelation is Trinitarian in character.
    - The triune God is the source and standard of all knowledge.
    - Human knowledge is analogical, reflecting the Trinity’s archetypal knowledge.
    - The economic Trinity makes the ontological Trinity known to creatures.
    - "All revelation is a revelation of the triune God." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Antithesis to Non-Christian Thought**
    - Non-Christian philosophies fail to account for unity and diversity.
    - Only the Christian doctrine of the Trinity resolves the problem of the one and the many.
    - The ontological Trinity is the foundation for Christian apologetics.
    - The economic Trinity demonstrates God’s engagement with creation without compromising His transcendence.
    - "The doctrine of the ontological Trinity is the heart of Christian theism." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust articulation of the **ontological Trinity** as the foundation for all knowledge and reality has profoundly shaped Reformed theology and presuppositional apologetics. His insistence on the equal ultimacy of unity and diversity in God remains a hallmark of his legacy, influencing generations of theologians and apologists. By grounding the distinction between the ontological and economic Trinity in the self-contained fullness of God, Van Til provided a framework that continues to inform contemporary discussions on the doctrine of God and the nature of revelation.
