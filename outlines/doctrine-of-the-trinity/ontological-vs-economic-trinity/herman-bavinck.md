# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck distinguished carefully between the **ontological Trinity** (God as He is in Himself, ad intra) and the **economic Trinity** (God as revealed in salvation history, ad extra). He insisted that the **unity and distinction of persons** in the Godhead are equally ultimate, and that the **economic missions** of the Son and Spirit reflect but do not constitute their eternal relations. For Bavinck, the **doctrine of the Trinity** is foundational for all Christian theology, shaping both dogmatic reflection and the church’s understanding of revelation.

- "The Trinity reveals itself in the economy of salvation, but this revelation presupposes an eternal immanent Trinity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- The Doctrine of God (abridged translation)
- "The Essence of Christianity" (in Essays on Religion, Science, and Society)
- Philosophy of Revelation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Ontological and Economic Trinity**
    - The **ontological Trinity** refers to God’s eternal being, independent of creation.
    - The **economic Trinity** concerns God’s self-disclosure in redemptive history.
    - The economic missions of the Son and Spirit are rooted in their eternal processions.
    - The distinction safeguards both God’s transcendence and His immanence.
    - "The economic Trinity presupposes the ontological Trinity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Unity of Essence and Distinction of Persons**
    - The three persons share one undivided **divine essence**.
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit are distinguished by **personal properties**, not by essence or rank.
    - The **personal distinctions** are eternal and necessary, not contingent on creation or redemption.
    - The unity and diversity in God are equally ultimate and foundational for all theology.
    - "In God, there is unity of essence and trinity of persons." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Revelation Reflects but Does Not Constitute the Trinity**
    - God’s triune nature is revealed through **redemptive history** but is not created by it.
    - The **missions** of the Son and Spirit in time correspond to their eternal relations.
    - The economic Trinity is a true revelation of who God eternally is.
    - There is no difference between the God who is and the God who reveals Himself.
    - "The Trinity who reveals Himself is the same as the Trinity who is." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

4. **Rejection of Subordinationism and Modalism**
    - All three persons are fully and equally **God**.
    - The Son and Spirit are not subordinate in essence or deity to the Father.
    - Modalism is rejected: the persons are not mere modes or manifestations.
    - The distinctions are real, eternal, and personal, not functional only.
    - "The persons are not simply modes of being, but real distinctions within the one divine essence." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

5. **Trinitarian Doctrine as Foundation for Christian Faith**
    - The **Trinity** is the heart of Christian dogmatics and worship.
    - The doctrine shapes the church’s understanding of **revelation**, **redemption**, and **communion with God**.
    - The triune God is the source and goal of all things, grounding both creation and salvation.
    - Trinitarian theology guards against both rationalism and mysticism by upholding mystery and revelation.
    - "The entire Christian faith stands or falls with the confession of the Trinity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s rigorous articulation of the **ontological and economic Trinity** has profoundly influenced Reformed dogmatics, providing a careful balance between God’s transcendence and immanence. His insistence that the economic Trinity truly reveals the eternal triune God has shaped modern discussions on revelation and the doctrine of God. Bavinck’s work remains a cornerstone for theologians seeking to uphold both the unity and distinction within the Godhead, and his legacy endures in contemporary Trinitarian theology.
