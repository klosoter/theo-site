# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg reinterpreted the **ontological** and **economic Trinity** by emphasizing the dynamic self-revelation of God in history. He challenged traditional distinctions by arguing that the **immanent Trinity** is fully disclosed through the **historical economy of salvation**, making God’s being inseparable from his acts in the world. For Pannenberg, the identity of God is revealed eschatologically, as the divine life unfolds in relation to creation and history.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Basis for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - God’s being is revealed in the historical acts culminating in Jesus Christ.
    - The **economic Trinity** is not secondary but foundational for understanding God’s identity.
    - Revelation is not merely propositional but eventful and historical.
    - The **ontological Trinity** is accessible only through God’s self-disclosure in history.
    - "The being of God is a being-in-relation, and this relation is revealed in the history of Jesus." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Eschatological Realization of Divine Identity**
    - God’s identity is not fully given until the consummation of history.
    - The **Trinitarian relations** are realized and revealed eschatologically.
    - The future of God’s kingdom shapes the understanding of the divine life.
    - The **immanent Trinity** is known only as the economic Trinity is completed.
    - "God’s being is open to the future, and only in the eschaton will his triunity be fully manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Rejection of a Static Ontological Trinity**
    - Critiques classical views that separate God’s inner life from his actions.
    - Argues that God’s being is constituted in and through his historical engagement.
    - The **immanent Trinity** is not a timeless essence but a dynamic reality.
    - The distinction between ontological and economic Trinity is not absolute.
    - "The traditional distinction between the immanent and economic Trinity must be rethought in light of God’s historical self-revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Relationality and Mutuality within the Trinity**
    - The divine persons exist in mutual self-giving and openness.
    - The **Father, Son, and Spirit** are defined by their relations in the economy.
    - God’s unity is constituted by the communion of persons in history.
    - The Trinity is not a closed circle but open to the world and history.
    - "The unity of God is constituted by the mutual relations of Father, Son, and Spirit as revealed in salvation history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Historical Mediation of Divine Life**
    - God’s eternal being is mediated through temporal events.
    - The **incarnation** and resurrection are central to understanding God’s triunity.
    - The economic actions of God are not mere appearances but the reality of God’s being.
    - The history of Jesus is the locus of Trinitarian revelation.
    - "The history of Jesus is the decisive revelation of the trinitarian being of God." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to the **ontological and economic Trinity** has significantly influenced modern Trinitarian theology, especially in emphasizing the unity of God’s being and action. His insistence on the historical and eschatological disclosure of the divine life challenged static metaphysical accounts and inspired renewed attention to **revelation** and **salvation history**. While controversial, his work remains a touchstone for discussions about the relationship between God’s inner life and his engagement with the world.
