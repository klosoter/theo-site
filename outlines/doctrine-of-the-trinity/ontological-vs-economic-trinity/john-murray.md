# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray maintained a robustly orthodox understanding of the **Trinity**, carefully distinguishing between the **ontological Trinity** (God as He is in Himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God as He reveals Himself in redemptive history). He emphasized the **unity of essence** and **distinction of persons**, while rejecting any subordinationism within the Godhead, insisting that distinctions in the **economy of salvation** do not imply inferiority or difference in essence.

- "The distinctions in the economy of redemption do not imply any inferiority or subordination of essence in the Trinity." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Redemption—Accomplished and Applied" (1955)

- "Christian Baptism" (1952)
- "The Trinity" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "Principles of Conduct" (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Trinity: Unity and Equality of Persons**
    - Asserts the full **equality** and **unity of essence** among Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - Rejects any notion of ontological subordination within the Godhead.
    - Emphasizes that all three persons share the same **divine attributes**.
    - The distinctions are of **personhood**, not of being or essence.
    - "There is but one divine being, and the three persons are coequal and coeternal." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Economic Trinity: Distinction in Roles**
    - Recognizes that the persons of the Trinity assume different roles in **redemptive history**.
    - The Father sends, the Son is sent, and the Spirit applies redemption.
    - These roles are **functional** and do not reflect ontological hierarchy.
    - The economic distinctions serve the purpose of **revelation** and **salvation**.
    - "The economy of redemption is the sphere in which the distinctions of the persons are most clearly manifested." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Revelation of the Trinity in Redemptive History**
    - The **economic Trinity** is how God makes Himself known in the acts of creation and redemption.
    - Scripture reveals the triune God through the distinct actions of each person.
    - The **ontological Trinity** is inferred from the economic, but not reducible to it.
    - The acts of God in history are the basis for our knowledge of the Trinity.
    - "It is in the economy of redemption that the doctrine of the Trinity comes to its richest expression." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Guarding Against Modalism and Subordinationism**
    - Insists that distinctions in the economic Trinity do not collapse into mere modes (modalism).
    - Warns against reading economic roles as implying **ontological subordination**.
    - Upholds the **personal distinctions** as real and eternal.
    - Maintains the **orthodox Nicene** framework in trinitarian theology.
    - "The distinctions are not simply modes of manifestation but are personal and eternal." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Trinitarian Foundation for Redemption**
    - The work of redemption is grounded in the eternal counsel of the triune God.
    - Each person of the Trinity is involved in the accomplishment and application of salvation.
    - The **unity of purpose** in redemption reflects the unity of essence.
    - The economic Trinity reveals the **covenantal** and relational nature of God.
    - "The redemptive plan is the product of the counsel of the triune God, executed in perfect unity." (Redemption—Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of the **ontological and economic Trinity** has shaped Reformed theology’s approach to trinitarian doctrine, especially in distinguishing person and work without compromising unity or equality. His writings have become standard references for understanding the relationship between the eternal being of God and His self-revelation in history. Murray’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of the Trinity, particularly in debates over subordination and the application of trinitarian theology to ecclesiology and soteriology.
