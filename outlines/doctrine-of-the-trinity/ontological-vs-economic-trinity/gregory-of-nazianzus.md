# Gregory of Nazianzus (c. 329–390)

Gregory of Nazianzus was pivotal in articulating the distinction between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal being as Father, Son, and Spirit) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s actions in salvation history). He emphasized the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the divine persons while maintaining their distinct roles in **revelation** and **redemption**, laying groundwork for later Trinitarian theology.

- "No sooner do I conceive of the One than I am illumined by the splendor of the Three; no sooner do I distinguish them than I am carried back to the One." (Oration 40.41)

## Key Works

- Theological Orations (Orations 27–31)
- Oration 29 (Second Theological Oration)
- Oration 31 (Fifth Theological Oration)
- Letters (especially Epistle 101)
- John Behr, *The Nicene Faith* (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Ontological and Economic Trinity**
    - The **ontological Trinity** refers to the eternal relations of origin within the Godhead.
    - The **economic Trinity** concerns the manifestation of the persons in the history of salvation.
    - Gregory insists that the divine persons are not defined by their missions but by their eternal relations.
    - The economic missions reveal but do not constitute the inner life of God.
    - "I cannot think of the One without being immediately surrounded by the splendor of the Three." (Oration 40.41)

2. **Unity of Essence, Distinction of Persons**
    - The three persons share one **ousia** (essence) but are distinct as **hypostases** (persons).
    - The Father is unbegotten, the Son begotten, and the Spirit proceeds.
    - The distinctions are not gradations in deity but relational.
    - The unity of essence safeguards against tritheism.
    - "We worship the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—three in one and one in three." (Oration 31.14)

3. **Eternal Generation and Procession**
    - The Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father.
    - These relations are intrinsic to the Godhead, not merely economic.
    - The eternal relations ground the economic missions.
    - Gregory avoids subordinationism by rooting distinctions in eternal origin, not function.
    - "The begetting of God must be honored by silence." (Oration 29.8)

4. **Revelation of the Trinity in Salvation History**
    - The Old Testament hints at the Trinity; the New Testament reveals it fully.
    - The Father is revealed first, then the Son, then the Spirit.
    - The economic revelation is progressive but reflects the eternal reality.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit correspond to their eternal relations.
    - "The Old Testament proclaimed the Father openly, the Son more obscurely; the New manifested the Son, and suggested the deity of the Spirit." (Oration 31.26)

5. **Inseparable Operations (Opera ad extra indivisa sunt)**
    - All external works of God are performed by all three persons together.
    - Each person participates according to their personal property.
    - The unity of action reflects the unity of essence.
    - The economic distinctions do not divide the divine will or power.
    - "All that the Father has belongs likewise to the Son, except the being unbegotten." (Oration 30.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Gregory’s careful distinction between the **ontological** and **economic Trinity** became foundational for later Trinitarian theology, especially in the **Cappadocian** tradition and the ecumenical councils. His articulation of the unity of essence and distinction of persons shaped both Eastern and Western Christian thought. Gregory’s influence endures in contemporary discussions on the doctrine of God, especially regarding the relationship between God’s eternal being and historical revelation.
