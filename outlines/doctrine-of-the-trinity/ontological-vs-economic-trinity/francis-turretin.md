# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin carefully distinguished between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal, internal being) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s external works in creation and redemption). He insisted that the **personal distinctions** within the Godhead are grounded in **eternal relations of origin**, not merely in the roles assumed in the economy of salvation. For Turretin, the **unity of essence** and the **inseparable operations** of the divine persons safeguard both the equality and distinction within the Trinity.

- "The distinction between the Trinity of essence and the Trinity of persons must be accurately maintained, lest we confound the internal and external acts of God." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Trinity: Eternal Distinctions**
    - The **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** are distinguished by eternal relations of origin, not by function or rank.
    - The divine essence is numerically one, shared fully and equally by each person.
    - The distinctions are real and internal, not merely nominal or economic.
    - The **processions** (generation and spiration) are wholly immanent to God’s being.
    - "The persons are distinguished not by works or offices, but by their eternal relations." (Institutes)

2. **Economic Trinity: Manifestation in History**
    - The **economic Trinity** refers to the way God reveals himself in the works of creation and redemption.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit reflect, but do not constitute, their eternal distinctions.
    - The order of operations in the economy is grounded in the order of persons in the ontological Trinity.
    - The economic roles do not imply subordination of essence or dignity.
    - "The economy of salvation presupposes, but does not create, the distinctions of persons." (Institutes)

3. **Inseparable Operations**
    - All external works of God are performed indivisibly by the whole Trinity.
    - Appropriation of certain works to specific persons is a matter of revelation, not division of labor.
    - The unity of divine action preserves the unity of essence.
    - The persons act jointly, though certain works are attributed to one for pedagogical reasons.
    - "The external works of the Trinity are undivided, though appropriated for our understanding." (Institutes)

4. **Guarding Against Modalism and Subordinationism**
    - The ontological distinction avoids modalism by affirming real personal distinctions.
    - The economic distinction avoids subordinationism by denying any inequality of essence.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit are voluntary and temporal, not ontological.
    - The Father is not greater than the Son or Spirit in being or glory.
    - "We must not confound the order of persons with a difference of essence or dignity." (Institutes)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Distinctions**
    - The doctrine is grounded in the progressive revelation of both Old and New Testaments.
    - Key texts (e.g., John 1, Matthew 28:19) reveal both the unity and distinction of persons.
    - The economic missions are interpreted in light of eternal generation and procession.
    - Scripture’s language about sending and being sent is understood theologically, not anthropomorphically.
    - "Scripture teaches both the unity of essence and the trinity of persons, each in its own order." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinction between the **ontological** and **economic Trinity** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy, influencing confessional formulations and systematic theology. His insistence on the unity of essence and the real, eternal distinctions of persons provided a bulwark against both **modalism** and **subordinationism**. Turretin’s approach shaped the trajectory of post-Reformation Trinitarian thought, ensuring that the doctrine remained both biblically grounded and philosophically coherent. His work continues to be a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between God’s eternal being and his historical revelation.
