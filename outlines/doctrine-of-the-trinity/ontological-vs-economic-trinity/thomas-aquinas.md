# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a rigorous account of the **Trinity** that carefully distinguishes between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal inner life) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s actions in history). He emphasized the **unity of essence** and the **distinction of persons** within the Godhead, grounding the missions of the Son and Spirit in their eternal processions. Aquinas’s approach shaped later Western theology’s understanding of how the **immanent** and **economic** aspects of the Trinity relate.

- "The persons proceed within the divine nature, and from this procession arises the mission of the divine persons in time." (Summa Theologiae I, q.43, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, Part I, Questions 27–43
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 1–26
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book I, Distinctions 26–34
- De Potentia, Questions 9–10
- The Trinity (De Trinitate), especially relevant sections

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Ontological and Economic Trinity**
    - The **ontological Trinity** refers to the eternal relations of origin among Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The **economic Trinity** concerns the missions of the Son and Spirit in salvation history.
    - The economic missions are grounded in and reveal the eternal processions.
    - There is no change in God; the distinction is in relation to creation, not within God Himself.
    - "The temporal mission is founded on the eternal procession." (Summa Theologiae I, q.43, a.2)

2. **Unity of Divine Essence**
    - All three persons share the same **divine essence** fully and equally.
    - There is no division or composition in God’s being.
    - The persons are distinguished only by their relations of origin, not by essence.
    - The unity of essence undergirds the inseparability of divine actions ad extra.
    - "In God, essence and person are really identical, but are distinguished by relations." (Summa Theologiae I, q.39, a.1)

3. **Eternal Processions as Basis for Missions**
    - The Son proceeds eternally from the Father by **generation**; the Spirit proceeds from Father and Son by **spiration**.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit in time reflect their eternal origins.
    - The sending of the Son and Spirit is a manifestation, not a change, of their eternal processions.
    - The economic Trinity is a revelation of the ontological Trinity.
    - "The mission of a divine person only means that He begins to exist in a new way in the creature." (Summa Theologiae I, q.43, a.2)

4. **Inseparability of Divine Operations**
    - All external works of God (opera ad extra) are undivided and performed by all three persons.
    - Appropriation of certain works to specific persons is for pedagogical clarity, not because of real division.
    - The missions of Son and Spirit are appropriated according to their relational properties.
    - The unity of action preserves the unity of the divine essence.
    - "The works of the Trinity are inseparable, just as the essence is inseparable." (Summa Contra Gentiles IV, ch. 25)

5. **Revelation of the Trinity in the Economy**
    - The **economic Trinity** makes known the **ontological Trinity** to creatures.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit are the means by which the inner life of God is revealed.
    - Human knowledge of the Trinity is dependent on God’s self-disclosure in history.
    - The economic order is subordinate to and grounded in the eternal order.
    - "The invisible mission is the giving of the divine person in a new way, namely, by grace." (Summa Theologiae I, q.43, a.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s careful articulation of the **ontological** and **economic Trinity** became foundational for later Western theology, especially in the Roman Catholic tradition. His distinction influenced both scholastic and modern discussions on the relationship between God’s eternal being and historical revelation. The clarity with which he maintained the unity of essence and the real distinction of persons continues to shape systematic treatments of the doctrine of God. Aquinas’s synthesis remains a touchstone for debates on the **immanent** and **economic** Trinity in both ecumenical and confessional contexts.
