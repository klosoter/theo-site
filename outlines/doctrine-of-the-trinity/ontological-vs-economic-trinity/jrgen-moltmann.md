# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann reconfigures the relationship between the **ontological Trinity** (God’s eternal being) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s self-revelation in history), insisting that God’s inner life is dynamically shaped by His actions in **salvation history**. He rejects a strict separation between the two, arguing that the **immanent Trinity** is revealed and constituted through the **history of Jesus Christ** and the **Spirit**. For Moltmann, the cross and resurrection are central events where God’s triune nature is disclosed and enacted.

- "The history of Jesus is the history of God, and the history of God is the history of Jesus." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of a strict ontological-economic divide**
    - Argues that the **immanent Trinity** is not hidden behind the **economic Trinity**, but is revealed in and through it.
    - Maintains that God’s eternal being is shaped by His historical acts, especially in **Christ** and the **Spirit**.
    - Critiques classical doctrines that posit an abstract, static divine essence apart from revelation.
    - Sees the cross as the event where God’s triune nature is most fully disclosed.
    - "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

2. **Trinitarian history of God**
    - Proposes that God’s being is constituted in the history of salvation.
    - Emphasizes the mutual indwelling and relationality of **Father, Son, and Spirit** as revealed in history.
    - Views the cross as the event of intra-divine suffering and love.
    - Argues that God’s identity is inseparable from His actions in the world.
    - "God is not God without the history of Jesus and the history of the Spirit." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

3. **Social doctrine of the Trinity**
    - Advocates for a **perichoretic** (mutually indwelling) understanding of the Trinity.
    - Sees the triune God as a community of persons in loving relationship.
    - Connects the Trinity to human community and liberation.
    - Rejects monarchical or hierarchical models of divine unity.
    - "The unity of the triune God is to be found in the communion of the three divine persons." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **The cross as the center of Trinitarian revelation**
    - Asserts that the crucifixion reveals the inner life of God.
    - Interprets the cry of dereliction as a Trinitarian event involving **Father, Son, and Spirit**.
    - Argues that divine suffering is essential to God’s being.
    - Sees the resurrection as the vindication and continuation of the triune event.
    - "The cross is the open Trinity." (The Crucified God)

5. **Eschatological orientation of the Trinity**
    - Holds that the Trinity is oriented toward the future and the coming kingdom.
    - Sees God’s triune life as open to the world and history.
    - Connects the **Spirit’s** work to the hope of new creation.
    - Emphasizes the dynamic, forward-moving character of God’s being.
    - "The trinitarian history of God is open to the future of the world." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s **trinitarian theology** has profoundly influenced contemporary discussions on the relationship between the **ontological** and **economic Trinity**, challenging classical distinctions and inspiring renewed interest in the doctrine of God. His emphasis on the cross, relationality, and the social implications of the Trinity has shaped liberation, feminist, and political theologies. Moltmann’s work continues to provoke debate about divine suffering, the nature of God’s unity, and the relevance of the Trinity for Christian life and hope.
