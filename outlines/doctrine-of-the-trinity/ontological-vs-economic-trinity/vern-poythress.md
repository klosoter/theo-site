# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches the distinction between the **ontological Trinity** (God as He is in Himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God as He reveals Himself in redemptive history) with a commitment to the unity and diversity within the Godhead. He emphasizes that the **revelation of God** in history is always consistent with His eternal being, and that our knowledge of the Trinity is shaped by **Scripture** and the **Creator-creature distinction**.

- "The distinctions among the persons of the Trinity are not merely roles in history, but are rooted in the eternal being of God." (The Mystery of the Trinity, p. 49)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological and Economic Distinction Maintained**
    - Affirms the classical distinction between **ontological Trinity** (immanent) and **economic Trinity** (manifested in history).
    - Insists that the economic actions of God reveal, but do not exhaust, His eternal being.
    - Warns against collapsing the economic into the ontological, which risks modalism.
    - Stresses that all revelation is analogical, shaped by the Creator-creature distinction.
    - "We must not confuse God’s eternal being with his actions in history, though the latter always faithfully reveal the former." (The Mystery of the Trinity, p. 52)

2. **Scripture as the Norm for Trinitarian Knowledge**
    - Holds that all knowledge of the Trinity is mediated through **special revelation**.
    - Rejects speculative approaches that go beyond biblical data.
    - Emphasizes the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture for understanding both the ontological and economic Trinity.
    - Advocates for a redemptive-historical reading of Trinitarian revelation.
    - "Scripture is our only access to the mystery of the Trinity, both in God’s being and his works." (The Mystery of the Trinity, p. 41)

3. **Unity and Diversity in God**
    - Asserts the **unity of essence** and **distinction of persons** as foundational.
    - Argues that the economic roles of Father, Son, and Spirit reflect their eternal relations.
    - Uses the concept of **perichoresis** to explain mutual indwelling without confusion.
    - Warns against subordinating the Son or Spirit in being, while affirming order in operations.
    - "The unity and diversity in God are equally ultimate, and both are displayed in his works." (Symphonic Theology, p. 84)

4. **Analogical Knowledge and the Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - Emphasizes that human knowledge of God is always analogical, not univocal.
    - The distinction between ontological and economic Trinity is necessary due to our finite perspective.
    - Our language about God must respect the **incomprehensibility** of His essence.
    - Uses **multiperspectivalism** to approach Trinitarian doctrine from various angles.
    - "We know God truly but not exhaustively; our distinctions reflect both revelation and our limitations." (The Mystery of the Trinity, p. 67)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Focus**
    - The economic Trinity is most clearly revealed in the history of redemption.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit in salvation history correspond to their eternal relations.
    - The pattern of revelation is always Trinitarian, from creation to consummation.
    - Christ’s incarnation and the Spirit’s outpouring are central to understanding the economic Trinity.
    - "The drama of redemption is the arena where the triune God makes himself known." (The Mystery of the Trinity, p. 112)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions of the **ontological and economic Trinity** by integrating biblical theology, philosophy, and systematic reflection. His insistence on **Scripture** as the norm and his use of **multiperspectivalism** have influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to Trinitarian doctrine. Poythress’s work continues to encourage careful distinction without separation, and unity without confusion, in understanding the triune God.
