# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas firmly rejected any notion of **eternal functional subordination** within the **Trinity**, insisting on the absolute equality and unity of the **divine persons**. For Aquinas, distinctions among the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** are rooted in **relations of origin** (procession and generation), not in hierarchy or subordination of will or authority. He maintained that all three persons share the same **divine essence** and act inseparably in all external works.

- "In God there is no precedence or succession, but only distinction of origin." (Summa Theologiae I, q.42, a.3)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I, qq.27–43 (on the Trinity)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, chs. 24–26
- De Potentia, qq.9–10
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book I, Distinctions 26–34
- Gilles Emery, The Trinitarian Theology of St Thomas Aquinas (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Divine Essence**
    - The three persons share one **undivided divine essence**.
    - No person possesses a lesser or greater share of deity.
    - All divine attributes are fully possessed by each person.
    - The divine will and power are identical in all three.
    - "There is one essence, one power, and one operation of the three persons." (Summa Theologiae I, q.42, a.6)

2. **Distinction by Relations of Origin**
    - The persons are distinguished solely by **relations of origin** (paternity, filiation, spiration).
    - These relations do not imply subordination or inequality.
    - The Father begets, the Son is begotten, the Spirit proceeds.
    - The order among persons is logical, not ontological or functional.
    - "The divine persons are distinguished by the relations alone." (Summa Theologiae I, q.28, a.3)

3. **Inseparable Operations (Opera ad extra)**
    - All external works of God are performed by the Trinity as one.
    - No person acts independently or with a distinct will in creation or redemption.
    - The missions of Son and Spirit reflect their eternal processions, not subordination.
    - Economic roles do not imply eternal hierarchy.
    - "All the works of God in creatures are common to the whole Trinity." (Summa Theologiae I, q.45, a.6)

4. **Equality of Authority and Power**
    - No person of the Trinity commands or obeys another.
    - Authority and power are identical in all three persons.
    - Any language of sending or mission refers to temporal effects, not eternal relations.
    - The Son’s obedience is proper to his human nature, not his divine personhood.
    - "There is no authority or subjection among the divine persons." (Summa Theologiae I, q.42, a.4)

5. **Rejection of Eternal Functional Subordination**
    - Eternal subordination would compromise **divine simplicity** and equality.
    - Any subordination is only in the order of origin, not in will or function.
    - The Son’s obedience is a matter of the **Incarnation**, not the eternal Trinity.
    - The doctrine safeguards against tritheism and subordinationism.
    - "To say that the Son is less than the Father pertains to the economy, not to the divinity." (Summa Theologiae I, q.42, a.4)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s robust defense of the **unity and equality of the divine persons** has profoundly shaped classical Christian doctrine and remains a central reference point in debates over **eternal functional subordination**. His careful distinction between **relations of origin** and economic missions has been pivotal in safeguarding orthodox Trinitarianism against both subordinationism and modalism. Contemporary discussions often appeal to Aquinas to critique any suggestion of eternal hierarchy within the Godhead, underscoring his enduring influence on both Catholic and Reformed theology.
