# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** debates with a commitment to classical **Trinitarian orthodoxy** while emphasizing the importance of **authority and submission** within the Godhead as revealed in Scripture. He affirms the **ontological equality** of the divine persons but argues that **role distinctions**—including the Son’s submission to the Father—are both eternal and compatible with full deity, reflecting his broader emphasis on **biblical theology** and **multiperspectivalism**.

- "The subordination of the Son to the Father is not a subordination of essence or being, but a subordination of role or function." ("The Doctrine of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- No Other God: A Response to Open Theism (2001)
- "Biblical Evidence for the Eternal Submission of the Son to the Father" (various essays and lectures)
- Perspectives on the Doctrine of God (contributions in edited volumes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Equality of the Divine Persons**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit share the same **divine essence**.
    - No person of the Trinity is inferior in being or attributes.
    - **Subordination** pertains only to function, not to nature.
    - Upholds the Nicene and Chalcedonian formulations.
    - "There is no subordination of essence in the Trinity." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Eternal Functional Distinctions**
    - The Son’s submission to the Father is an **eternal reality**, not limited to the incarnation.
    - These distinctions are rooted in **Scriptural revelation**.
    - Functional roles do not imply inferiority or inequality.
    - The Spirit’s procession and the Son’s generation are reflected in their roles.
    - "The Son’s obedience to the Father is not merely a temporary arrangement for the incarnation, but an eternal relationship." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Authority and Submission as Trinitarian Categories**
    - **Authority** and **submission** are not merely economic but reflect eternal relationships.
    - These categories are seen as good and expressive of divine love.
    - The Father sends, the Son is sent, and the Spirit proceeds.
    - Role distinctions are not arbitrary but reveal the richness of the Godhead.
    - "Authority and submission are not signs of inferiority, but of the order and harmony within the Trinity." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Multiperspectival Approach to Trinitarian Theology**
    - Employs **multiperspectivalism** to understand the Trinity from normative, situational, and existential perspectives.
    - Recognizes the complexity and mystery of Trinitarian relationships.
    - Stresses the need to integrate **biblical, historical, and philosophical** insights.
    - Avoids reductionism by holding together unity and diversity.
    - "We must look at the Trinity from different perspectives to appreciate the fullness of biblical teaching." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Scriptural Priority in Trinitarian Formulation**
    - Prioritizes **biblical exegesis** over speculative theology.
    - Argues that Scripture clearly presents both equality and role distinctions.
    - Cautions against imposing extra-biblical philosophical categories.
    - Seeks to let the **biblical narrative** shape doctrinal conclusions.
    - "Our doctrine of the Trinity must be shaped first and foremost by Scripture." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s contributions to the **Eternal Functional Subordination** debates have provided a robust defense of the compatibility between eternal role distinctions and full **Trinitarian equality**. His work has influenced evangelical discussions by insisting on the primacy of Scripture and the legitimacy of functional subordination within the Godhead. Frame’s **multiperspectivalism** has encouraged theologians to approach complex doctrinal issues with humility and nuance, shaping contemporary Reformed engagement with Trinitarian theology.
