# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann addresses the question of **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** through his distinctive **social trinitarianism**, emphasizing the **perichoretic equality** and mutuality of the divine persons. He firmly rejects any notion of eternal subordination within the **immanent Trinity**, insisting that all three persons share the same divine life, dignity, and freedom.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity is the social doctrine of God." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Key Works

- The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God
- History and the Triune God
- Experiences in Theology
- God in Creation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Eternal Subordination**
    - Argues that any form of **eternal subordination** within the Trinity undermines the full divinity and equality of the Son and Spirit.
    - Views subordination as a feature of the **economic Trinity** (in salvation history), not the **immanent Trinity**.
    - Insists that all three persons possess the same divine attributes and dignity.
    - Critiques hierarchical models as projecting human social structures onto God.
    - "The subordination of the Son in the Trinity would destroy the unity of the divine essence." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

2. **Social Trinitarianism**
    - Emphasizes the **perichoresis** (mutual indwelling) of the Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - Sees the Trinity as a model for human community, marked by equality and mutual self-giving.
    - Rejects monarchical or authoritarian images of God.
    - Argues that the divine persons exist only in relation to one another.
    - "The unity of the triune God lies in the unity of the three Persons in their relations to one another." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

3. **Distinction Between Economic and Immanent Trinity**
    - Maintains that roles and missions in salvation history do not imply eternal subordination.
    - The **sending** of the Son and Spirit reflects the divine economy, not inner-Trinitarian hierarchy.
    - Warns against reading temporal missions back into the eternal being of God.
    - Stresses that the **immanent Trinity** is characterized by eternal equality and reciprocity.
    - "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa, but without subordination." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **Critique of Patriarchal and Hierarchical Theologies**
    - Argues that EFS models often reinforce patriarchal social orders.
    - Sees hierarchical trinitarianism as incompatible with the gospel of liberation and equality.
    - Advocates for a **liberative** understanding of the Trinity that challenges oppression.
    - Connects trinitarian doctrine to issues of justice and community.
    - "A hierarchical Trinity legitimizes domination and subordination in human society." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

5. **Trinitarian Love as the Basis for Equality**
    - Asserts that the essence of God is **love** shared equally among the persons.
    - Divine love is self-giving, reciprocal, and non-coercive.
    - The Trinity models a community of equals, not a chain of command.
    - This love grounds both divine and human freedom.
    - "God is love, and this love is the freedom of the divine persons for one another." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s robust **social trinitarianism** has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the Trinity, especially in debates over EFS. His insistence on the **equality and mutuality** of the divine persons challenges hierarchical and subordinationist models, influencing both academic theology and ecclesial practice. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire those seeking a trinitarian theology that promotes justice, liberation, and authentic community.
