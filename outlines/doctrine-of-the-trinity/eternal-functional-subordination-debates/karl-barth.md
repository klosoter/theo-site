# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth decisively rejected the notion of **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** within the **Trinity**, insisting on the full equality of the **divine persons** in both essence and will. For Barth, any subordination within the Godhead would compromise the **unity of the divine being** and threaten the doctrine of **homoousios**. He maintained that distinctions among the persons are rooted in their **relations of origin**, not in any eternal hierarchy of authority or function.

- "There is no second or third God, nor is there a first, second, or third God; there is only God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Eternal Subordination within the Trinity**
    - Barth denies any eternal subordination of role, authority, or function among the divine persons.
    - He argues that all three persons share the same **divine essence** and will.
    - Subordination, for Barth, applies only to the **economic Trinity** (God’s actions in history), not the **immanent Trinity** (God’s eternal being).
    - Any hint of eternal subordination undermines the unity and equality of the Godhead.
    - "The Son is not subordinate to the Father in being or will, but is one with Him." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Relations of Origin as the Basis for Distinction**
    - The only distinction among the persons is their mode of origin: **begetting** (Father), **being begotten** (Son), and **proceeding** (Spirit).
    - These relations do not entail hierarchy or subordination.
    - The **personal distinctions** are real, but do not affect the unity of divine action or authority.
    - Barth insists that the divine persons are coequal and coeternal.
    - "The distinctions are distinctions of relation, not of rank or degree." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **Unity of Divine Will and Action**
    - Barth emphasizes the single, undivided **divine will** shared by Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - There is no separate or subordinate willing within the Godhead.
    - All divine actions are the actions of the one God, though appropriated to each person.
    - The **perichoresis** (mutual indwelling) of the persons precludes any functional subordination.
    - "The will of God is the will of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit together." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

4. **Economic Subordination is Temporal and Voluntary**
    - Barth allows for a temporal, voluntary subordination of the Son in the **economy of salvation**.
    - This subordination is not eternal, but pertains to the Son’s mission and incarnation.
    - The Son’s obedience is a free act, not an expression of eternal hierarchy.
    - The economic roles do not reflect or establish ontological subordination.
    - "The obedience of the Son is the obedience of God Himself, not of a lesser being." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

5. **Safeguarding Divine Equality and Homoousios**
    - Barth is committed to the **Nicene** affirmation of the consubstantiality (**homoousios**) of the persons.
    - Any eternal subordination would compromise the full deity of the Son and Spirit.
    - The equality of the persons is essential for a proper doctrine of **revelation** and **salvation**.
    - Barth’s trinitarian theology aims to uphold both unity and distinction without hierarchy.
    - "The Son is of one being with the Father, and so is the Spirit." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s robust rejection of **Eternal Functional Subordination** has profoundly shaped modern trinitarian theology, especially in the Reformed tradition. His insistence on the **unity of the divine will** and the equality of the persons has been a bulwark against contemporary attempts to ground human social or gender hierarchies in the Trinity. Barth’s trinitarian framework continues to inform debates on the relationship between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**, and remains a touchstone for those defending the full deity and equality of the Son and Spirit.
