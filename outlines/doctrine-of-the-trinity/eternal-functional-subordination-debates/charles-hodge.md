# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, articulated a doctrine of the **Trinity** that affirms the full **ontological equality** of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit while maintaining their real **personal distinctions**. He strongly rejected any form of **eternal functional subordination** that would compromise the full **deity** and **co-equality** of the Son and Spirit with the Father.

- "The subordination of the Son to the Father is not as to nature or essence, but only as to mode of subsistence and operation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially chapters on the Trinity)
- "The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity" (Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review, 1840)
- "The Trinity" (Princeton Review, 1852)
- The Way of Life

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Equality of the Divine Persons**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit share the same **divine essence**.
    - Any subordination pertains only to **person** or **role**, not to **nature**.
    - Hodge rejects any view that would make the Son or Spirit inferior in being.
    - The unity of the Godhead is foundational to his doctrine of the Trinity.
    "The Scriptures teach that the Father, Son, and Spirit are the same in substance and equal in power and glory." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Subordination Only in the Economic Trinity**
    - Subordination is limited to the roles assumed in **redemption** and **revelation**.
    - The Son’s obedience is voluntary and temporal, not eternal or ontological.
    - The **missions** of the Son and Spirit reflect order, not inequality.
    - The economic roles do not imply eternal subordination in the Godhead.
    "The subordination of the Son is official and voluntary, not essential or necessary." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Rejection of Eternal Functional Subordination**
    - Hodge opposes any eternal subordination of function or authority within the Trinity.
    - Eternal subordination would undermine the **full deity** of the Son.
    - He distinguishes between **generation** (personal property) and subordination (role).
    - The Son’s subordination is a matter of **incarnation**, not eternal relation.
    "There is no subordination as to essence, only as to the mode of subsistence and operation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Classical Doctrine of Processions and Relations of Origin**
    - The Son is eternally begotten, and the Spirit proceeds, but these are not subordinationist.
    - These relations explain personal distinctions, not hierarchy.
    - The **relations of origin** do not entail differences in authority or will.
    - Hodge follows the **Nicene** and **Augustinian** tradition on these points.
    "The distinction of persons in the Godhead arises from the relations of origin, not from subordination of essence or authority." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Equality**
    - Hodge grounds his doctrine in the **biblical witness** to the Son’s full deity.
    - He emphasizes texts affirming the Son’s equality with the Father.
    - Scripture does not teach an eternal subordination of the Son’s will or authority.
    - The **Great Commission** and other passages are interpreted as economic, not ontological.
    "The Scriptures never represent the Son as inferior to the Father in essence or authority." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **ontological equality** of the divine persons shaped generations of Reformed theologians and set a standard for **orthodox Trinitarianism** in the American context. His careful distinction between the **economic** and **immanent Trinity** provided a bulwark against later proposals of eternal functional subordination. Hodge’s influence endures in contemporary debates, where his insistence on the full deity and co-equality of the Son remains a touchstone for confessional Reformed theology.
