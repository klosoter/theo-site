# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos did not directly engage the contemporary **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** debates, but his robust doctrine of the **Trinity** and insistence on the **ontological equality** of the divine persons have been influential in Reformed responses to EFS. Vos emphasized the **unity of essence** and the **distinction of persons** within the Godhead, grounding all intra-Trinitarian relations in the **immanent Trinity** rather than in any eternal subordination of role or function.

- "The three persons possess the one divine essence, not divided among them, but wholly and indivisibly belonging to each." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology"
- Pauline Eschatology (for broader Trinitarian implications)
- Secondary: Richard B. Gaffin, Jr., "Geerhardus Vos and the Interpretation of Paul"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Equality of the Divine Persons**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit share the same undivided **divine essence**.
    - No person is ontologically prior or subordinate to another.
    - Distinctions are of **personal relations**, not of being or rank.
    - Any subordination is only economic, not eternal or essential.
    - "The three persons are distinguished only by their personal properties, not by essence or rank." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Immanent vs. Economic Trinity**
    - Vos distinguishes between the **immanent Trinity** (God in Himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God in relation to creation).
    - Eternal relations of origin (generation, procession) do not imply subordination.
    - The Son’s submission is limited to the **economy of redemption**.
    - The eternal being of God is unaffected by temporal missions or roles.
    - "The distinction between the immanent and economic Trinity safeguards the equality of the persons." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Rejection of Eternal Functional Subordination**
    - Vos’s framework leaves no room for eternal subordination of role or authority within the Godhead.
    - Any subordination is strictly **temporal** and related to the Son’s incarnate mission.
    - Eternal subordination would compromise the **unity and simplicity** of God.
    - The **Nicene** tradition is upheld as the standard for Trinitarian orthodoxy.
    - "The Son’s subordination is not eternal but pertains to His mediatorial office." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

4. **Personal Properties and Relations of Origin**
    - The Father is unbegotten, the Son is begotten, the Spirit proceeds—these are the only eternal distinctions.
    - These relations do not entail hierarchy or authority structures.
    - The **personal properties** define the persons, not their functions or roles.
    - Vos insists on the classical Reformed understanding of **relations of origin**.
    - "The distinctions among the persons are rooted in relations of origin, not in function or authority." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

5. **Scriptural and Confessional Fidelity**
    - Vos grounds his doctrine in **Scripture** and the historic **Reformed confessions**.
    - He resists speculative theology that goes beyond biblical revelation.
    - The **Westminster Confession** and catechisms are normative for Trinitarian doctrine.
    - Vos’s exegesis upholds the full deity and equality of the Son and Spirit.
    - "We must not go beyond what Scripture and confession teach concerning the Trinity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s rigorous articulation of the **ontological equality** and unity of the divine persons has shaped Reformed critiques of **Eternal Functional Subordination**. His distinction between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity** provides a theological framework that resists reading temporal subordination back into the eternal Godhead. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary Reformed theology, serving as a bulwark against innovations that threaten classical Trinitarian doctrine. His work remains a touchstone for those defending the **Nicene** and confessional understanding of the Trinity.
