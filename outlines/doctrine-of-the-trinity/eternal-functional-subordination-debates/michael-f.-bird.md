# Michael Bird (1974– )

Michael Bird is a contemporary evangelical theologian who strongly opposes **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** within **Trinitarian theology**. Bird contends that EFS undermines the **doctrine of the Trinity** by compromising the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the divine persons, and he advocates a return to classical **Nicene orthodoxy** in understanding the relations within the Godhead.

- "The Son’s submission to the Father is not an eternal feature of the divine life, but a feature of the incarnate Son’s mission." (Evangelical Theology, 2nd ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Eternal Functional Subordination**
   - Argues that EFS is not supported by **historic creeds** or **confessions**.
   - Maintains that EFS introduces a hierarchy within the **immanent Trinity**.
   - Warns that EFS risks a form of **subordinationism** akin to early heresies.
   - Emphasizes the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the Father, Son, and Spirit.
   "The idea that the Son is eternally subordinate in role to the Father is a departure from Nicene orthodoxy." (Evangelical Theology, 2nd ed.)

2. **Distinction Between Economic and Immanent Trinity**
   - Stresses the difference between the **economic Trinity** (God’s actions in history) and the **immanent Trinity** (God’s inner life).
   - Asserts that the Son’s submission is limited to the **incarnation** and **redemptive mission**.
   - Denies that temporal submission reflects eternal relationships within the Godhead.
   - Upholds that the **missions** of the persons do not imply ontological subordination.
   "The submission of the Son is a feature of the economy of salvation, not of the eternal divine life." (Evangelical Theology, 2nd ed.)

3. **Commitment to Nicene Orthodoxy**
   - Affirms the **Nicene Creed** as the standard for Trinitarian doctrine.
   - Insists on the **homoousios** (same essence) of the Father and the Son.
   - Rejects any teaching that would compromise the **unity** and **equality** of the Trinity.
   - Sees the Nicene tradition as a safeguard against both modalism and subordinationism.
   "Nicene orthodoxy is the best guide for thinking about the Trinity." (What Christians Ought to Believe)

4. **Scriptural Foundation for Trinitarian Equality**
   - Argues that **biblical texts** do not teach eternal subordination of the Son.
   - Interprets passages about Jesus’ obedience as referring to his **incarnate mission**.
   - Highlights the **mutual glorification** and love among the divine persons in Scripture.
   - Cautions against reading contemporary social agendas into Trinitarian texts.
   "The New Testament presents the Son as equal with the Father in power and glory." (Evangelical Theology, 2nd ed.)

5. **Concern for Doctrinal and Practical Implications**
   - Warns that EFS can be used to justify **hierarchical gender roles** in the church and home.
   - Argues that Trinitarian doctrine should not be shaped by **social or cultural concerns**.
   - Emphasizes the importance of **doctrinal clarity** for the health of the church.
   - Calls for humility and fidelity to the **historic Christian faith** in doctrinal debates.
   "We must not let debates over gender roles distort our doctrine of God." (The New Evangelical Subordinationism?)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Bird has become a prominent evangelical voice advocating for **Nicene Trinitarianism** and warning against the theological dangers of EFS. His work has contributed to renewed attention to the **distinction between the economic and immanent Trinity** and has encouraged evangelicals to ground their doctrine of God in the historic creeds. Bird’s critiques have influenced both academic and popular discussions, helping to clarify the stakes of the EFS debate for contemporary theology.
