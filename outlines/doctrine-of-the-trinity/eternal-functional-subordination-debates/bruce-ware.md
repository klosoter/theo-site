# Bruce Ware (1952– )

Bruce Ware is a leading contemporary advocate of **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** within the doctrine of the **Trinity**. He argues that while the divine persons are ontologically equal, the **Son** eternally submits to the **Father’s authority** in role and function, a view he grounds in both biblical exegesis and historic **orthodoxy**.

- "The Father is supreme in authority, the Son is under the Father's authority, and the Spirit is under the authority of both the Father and the Son." ("Father, Son, and Holy Spirit," p. 43)

## Key Works

- "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance" (2005)
- "One God in Three Persons: Unity of Essence, Distinction of Persons, Implications for Life" (co-edited with John Starke, 2015)
- "The Man Christ Jesus: Theological Reflections on the Humanity of Christ" (2012)
- "The New Evangelical Subordinationism? Perspectives on the Equality of God the Father and God the Son" (in "One God in Three Persons," 2015)
- "Tampering with the Trinity: Does the Son Submit to His Father?" (Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, 2001)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Functional Subordination of the Son**
    - The Son’s submission to the Father is eternal, not merely economic or temporal.
    - This subordination concerns role and function, not essence or nature.
    - The Son’s obedience is a reflection of intra-Trinitarian relationships.
    - EFS is distinguished from ontological subordination, which Ware rejects.
    - "The Son’s submission to the Father is not a temporary arrangement but an eternal reality." ("Father, Son, and Holy Spirit," p. 71)

2. **Ontological Equality, Functional Distinction**
    - All three persons of the Trinity share the same divine essence.
    - Functional distinctions do not compromise the full deity of the Son or Spirit.
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit are co-equal in being, differing only in roles.
    - Ware insists that role does not imply inferiority of nature.
    - "The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are equally God, yet they relate in ordered ways." ("Father, Son, and Holy Spirit," p. 21)

3. **Biblical Foundation for Trinitarian Roles**
    - Ware grounds EFS in passages such as 1 Corinthians 11:3 and John 5:19.
    - He argues that the New Testament consistently presents the Son as subject to the Father.
    - The Spirit’s role is also one of willing submission to both Father and Son.
    - Scriptural patterns of authority and submission are seen as paradigmatic.
    - "Scripture presents the Father as supreme, the Son as obedient, and the Spirit as sent." ("Father, Son, and Holy Spirit," p. 55)

4. **Historical and Confessional Compatibility**
    - Ware claims EFS is consistent with Nicene and Chalcedonian orthodoxy.
    - He appeals to select patristic sources to support eternal role distinctions.
    - He distinguishes his view from Arianism by affirming full deity and equality.
    - Ware argues that the tradition allows for eternal relations of authority and submission.
    - "The Nicene Creed affirms the Son is eternally begotten, not made, and this begetting includes role distinctions." ("One God in Three Persons," p. 244)

5. **Implications for Gender Roles and Ecclesiology**
    - Ware connects EFS to complementarian views of gender roles.
    - He sees the Trinity as a model for authority and submission in marriage and church life.
    - The eternal submission of the Son is presented as a theological basis for human relationships.
    - This application is controversial and has generated significant debate.
    - "The relationships within the Trinity provide the ultimate foundation for relationships among men and women." ("Father, Son, and Holy Spirit," p. 21)

## Legacy and Impact

Bruce Ware’s advocacy of **Eternal Functional Subordination** has significantly shaped evangelical and Reformed discussions on the **Trinity** in the 21st century. His work has sparked intense debate, especially regarding the relationship between **Trinitarian doctrine** and gender roles. While some commend his efforts to articulate role distinctions within the Godhead, others criticize EFS as a departure from classical orthodoxy. Ware’s influence is evident in both scholarly literature and broader ecclesial conversations about the nature of God and the implications for Christian life.
