# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich did not directly participate in the contemporary **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** debates, but his theology of the **Trinity** and **divine self-manifestation** offers a critical alternative to hierarchical models within the Godhead. Tillich emphasized the **unity of the divine life** and the **symbolic nature of Trinitarian language**, rejecting any notion of ontological or eternal subordination among the **Trinitarian persons**.

- "The trinitarian symbols must be understood as expressions of the dynamic and living unity of God, not as a description of three divine beings or a hierarchy within God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinity as Symbolic Expression**
    - The **Trinity** is a symbolic way to express the dynamic unity and diversity within the divine life.
    - Trinitarian language points to the relational structure of God, not to literal distinctions of authority or function.
    - Rejects any form of **subordinationism** as incompatible with the unity of God.
    - Emphasizes the existential and experiential significance of Trinitarian symbols.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is a symbolic expression for the self-manifestation of the divine life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Rejection of Ontological Hierarchy**
    - Asserts the absolute equality of the **Father, Son, and Spirit** in being and power.
    - Denies any eternal or functional subordination within the Godhead.
    - Views hierarchical interpretations as distortions rooted in human social structures.
    - Argues that all Trinitarian distinctions are modes of divine self-revelation, not ranks.
    - "There is no hierarchy in God; all elements of the divine life participate equally in the ground of being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Dynamic Unity of Divine Life**
    - God’s unity is dynamic, not static, encompassing both distinction and unity.
    - The **immanent Trinity** is inseparable from the **economic Trinity**; distinctions arise in relation to revelation.
    - The divine life is a process of self-relatedness, not a structure of authority.
    - The relations within God are mutual and interdependent, not subordinating.
    - "The divine life is the power of being in which unity and diversity are equally affirmed." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Critique of Literalist Trinitarianism**
    - Warns against literalizing Trinitarian language, which leads to misunderstanding of God’s nature.
    - Trinitarian distinctions are existential symbols, not metaphysical descriptions.
    - Literalist readings risk introducing division and subordination into the Godhead.
    - Theological language must remain open, symbolic, and existentially meaningful.
    - "To take the trinitarian symbols literally is to destroy their power to express the mystery of the divine life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Revelation and the Structure of Personhood**
    - The **Son** represents the self-manifestation of God, not a subordinate role.
    - The **Spirit** is the power of unity and community, not a lesser divine person.
    - Revelation is the event in which God’s unity and diversity are experienced, not a disclosure of eternal roles.
    - The structure of personhood in God is a model for existential encounter, not a blueprint for authority.
    - "The trinitarian distinctions are modes of revelation, not eternal roles of subordination." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to the **Trinity** has provided a robust critique of any form of **Eternal Functional Subordination**, emphasizing the symbolic and existential dimensions of Trinitarian doctrine. His rejection of ontological or functional hierarchy within the Godhead has influenced modern theologians seeking to avoid subordinationist tendencies. Tillich’s thought continues to challenge literalist and hierarchical readings of the Trinity, shaping contemporary discussions on divine unity and relationality.
