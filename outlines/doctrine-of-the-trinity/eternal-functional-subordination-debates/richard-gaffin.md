# Richard Gaffin (1936–)

Richard Gaffin is a leading Reformed theologian who has critically engaged the debate over **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**, emphasizing the necessity of **Nicene Trinitarianism** and the unity of the **divine will**. He warns that EFS threatens the **ontological equality** of the divine persons and confuses the distinction between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.

- "The notion of eternal subordination of the Son in terms of authority and submission is not only biblically unfounded but also theologically hazardous." (Trinity Debate Panel Discussion, 2016)

## Key Works

- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Tradition" (Westminster Theological Journal, 2001)
- "The Trinity, the Bible, and the Church: Reconstructing the Doctrine of the Trinity" (in The New Evangelical Subordinationism?, 2012)
- "No Adam, No Christ" (2015) [sections on Trinitarian implications]
- "Calvin and the Trinity" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1992)
- Contributions to "One God in Three Persons" (2015, ed. Ware and Starke)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Eternal Functional Subordination**
    - Argues that EFS blurs the line between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.
    - Maintains that all three persons share the same **divine will** and authority.
    - Warns that EFS risks introducing a form of **subordinationism**.
    - Insists that distinctions in role pertain only to the **economy of redemption**.
    "Any subordination within the Trinity must be economic, not eternal or ontological." (The New Evangelical Subordinationism?)

2. **Upholding Nicene Orthodoxy**
    - Affirms the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - Emphasizes the importance of the **Nicene Creed** as a doctrinal boundary.
    - Rejects any formulation that implies gradation of authority in the Godhead.
    - Stresses the unity of **essence** and **will** in the Trinity.
    "Nicene orthodoxy leaves no room for an eternal subordination of the Son." (Trinity Debate Panel Discussion, 2016)

3. **Distinction Between Immanent and Economic Trinity**
    - Asserts that the **immanent Trinity** refers to God as He is in Himself, apart from creation.
    - The **economic Trinity** concerns God’s actions in redemptive history.
    - Warns against reading economic distinctions back into the immanent Trinity.
    - Sees the Son’s submission as limited to the incarnation and redemptive mission.
    "The Son’s obedience is a function of his incarnate mission, not his eternal relation to the Father." (The New Evangelical Subordinationism?)

4. **Unity of the Divine Will**
    - Holds that the three persons share one **indivisible will**.
    - Rejects models that posit distinct centers of authority or will within the Godhead.
    - Argues that multiple wills would compromise **divine simplicity**.
    - Sees the Son’s incarnate submission as a function of his human will.
    "To speak of the Son eternally submitting his will to the Father is to divide the divine will." (Trinity Debate Panel Discussion, 2016)

5. **Scriptural and Confessional Fidelity**
    - Grounds Trinitarian theology in **biblical exegesis** and **Reformed confessions**.
    - Critiques speculative approaches not rooted in Scripture.
    - Emphasizes the sufficiency of biblical revelation for Trinitarian doctrine.
    - Upholds the **Westminster Standards** as faithful expressions of orthodox Trinitarianism.
    "Our doctrine of the Trinity must be shaped by Scripture and the confessions, not by analogies or contemporary agendas." (Biblical Theology and the Westminster Tradition)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s critique of **Eternal Functional Subordination** has reinforced the boundaries of **Reformed orthodoxy** on the doctrine of the Trinity. His insistence on the unity of the divine will and the distinction between the immanent and economic Trinity has shaped contemporary Reformed responses to EFS. Gaffin’s work continues to influence systematic theology at Westminster and beyond, ensuring that debates over Trinitarian relations remain anchored in historic confessional standards.
