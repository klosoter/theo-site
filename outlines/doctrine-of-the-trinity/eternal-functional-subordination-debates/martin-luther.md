# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther did not directly address the contemporary **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** debates, but his doctrine of the **Trinity** and **Christology** laid groundwork for later discussions. Luther affirmed the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the divine persons, emphasizing the unity of **essence** and the distinction of **persons** without subordination in being or function within the Godhead.

- "We must beware lest we imagine that there are three gods; for there is but one God, and yet there are three persons in one divine essence." (Large Catechism)

## Key Works

- The Large Catechism
- The Small Catechism
- Lectures on Genesis
- The Bondage of the Will
- Sermons on John

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Equality of Persons**
    - The **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** are of one undivided **essence**.
    - No person is before or after, greater or lesser in deity.
    - Distinctions are of **relation** and not of rank or function.
    - Any subordination is only in the context of the **incarnation**, not in the eternal Trinity.
    - "There are not three gods, but one God and three persons, and each person is wholly God." (Large Catechism)

2. **Christ’s Functional Subordination is Economic, Not Eternal**
    - Christ’s obedience and submission are tied to his **incarnate mission**.
    - The Son’s subordination is not an eternal attribute but a role assumed in **redemption**.
    - The **humiliation** of Christ is voluntary and temporal.
    - Eternal subordination would compromise the **full deity** of the Son.
    - "He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death... not as God, but as man." (Sermons on Philippians 2)

3. **Rejection of Ontological Subordination**
    - The Son is not less than the Father in **essence** or **power**.
    - Any subordination within the Trinity is heretical and reminiscent of **Arianism**.
    - The **Nicene Creed** is upheld as the standard of Trinitarian orthodoxy.
    - The divine will is one, not divided among the persons.
    - "We confess one God in three persons, equal in majesty and power." (Large Catechism)

4. **Scripture as the Norm for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - All Trinitarian formulations must be grounded in **Scripture**.
    - Human reason is subordinate to biblical revelation in matters of the **Godhead**.
    - The **Word of God** reveals the mystery of the Trinity sufficiently for faith.
    - Speculation beyond Scripture leads to error and division.
    - "What is not revealed in Scripture, we should not presume to define." (Lectures on Genesis)

5. **Christological Focus in Trinitarian Reflection**
    - The person and work of **Christ** are central to understanding the Trinity.
    - The **incarnation** reveals the relational distinctions within the Godhead.
    - The unity of **divine and human natures** in Christ is a model for understanding divine relations.
    - The **mediatorial work** of Christ is temporal, not eternal.
    - "In Christ we see the fullness of the Godhead bodily." (Sermons on John)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of the **co-equality of the divine persons** and his insistence on the economic, not eternal, nature of Christ’s subordination have shaped classical Protestant approaches to the Trinity. His views provide a strong foundation against any form of **eternal functional subordination** within the Godhead. Later Lutheran and Reformed theologians have drawn on Luther’s commitment to **Scriptural authority** and Nicene orthodoxy in rejecting EFS, ensuring his enduring influence in contemporary Trinitarian debates.
