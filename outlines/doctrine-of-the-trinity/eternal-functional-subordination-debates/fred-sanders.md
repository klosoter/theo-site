# Fred Sanders (1968– )

Fred Sanders is a contemporary evangelical theologian who has engaged critically with the **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** debates, emphasizing the classical doctrine of the **Trinity** and the unity of the **divine will**. Sanders argues that the **Son’s obedience** pertains to the **economic Trinity** and should not be projected into the **immanent Trinity**, warning against revisions that risk undermining **Nicene orthodoxy**.

- "The relations of origin are the only distinctions in the immanent Trinity; everything else is common to all three." ("The Deep Things of God")

## Key Works

- The Deep Things of God: How the Trinity Changes Everything (2010)
- Fountain of Salvation: Trinity and Soteriology (2016)
- “The Trinity and the Shape of Christian Doctrine” in Advancing Trinitarian Theology (2014)
- “On the Divine Unity: Trinity, Equality, and Will” (Themelios, 2016)
- “Classical Trinitarianism and Eternal Functional Subordination” (Credo Magazine, 2016)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Classical Doctrine of the Trinity**
   - Affirms the **unity of essence** and **inseparable operations** of the three persons.
   - Rejects any eternal distinction of authority or will within the Godhead.
   - Emphasizes the **relations of origin** (generation and procession) as the only eternal distinctions.
   - Insists that all divine actions are the work of the one undivided Trinity.
   - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not about three centers of consciousness or will, but about one God in three persons." (The Deep Things of God)

2. **Distinction Between Economic and Immanent Trinity**
   - The Son’s obedience and submission are proper to the **economy of salvation**.
   - Warns against reading economic roles back into the eternal life of God.
   - Maintains that the **immanent Trinity** is characterized by equality and unity, not hierarchy.
   - The **missions** reflect, but do not redefine, the eternal processions.
   - "The economic missions reveal the eternal processions, but do not introduce subordination into the divine life." (Fountain of Salvation)

3. **Unity of the Divine Will**
   - Asserts that God has one will, not three separate wills.
   - Denies that the Son’s obedience implies a distinct or subordinate will.
   - The **Father, Son, and Spirit** act inseparably and harmoniously.
   - Any notion of eternal subordination of will is a departure from **Nicene orthodoxy**.
   - "To posit three wills in God is to abandon the doctrine of the Trinity for tritheism." (Themelios, 2016)

4. **Nicene Orthodoxy as Normative**
   - Upholds the **Nicene Creed** as the standard for trinitarian doctrine.
   - Critiques EFS as inconsistent with the **homoousion** and eternal equality.
   - Stresses the importance of **doctrinal retrieval** from the patristic tradition.
   - Encourages evangelical theology to remain within the bounds of **historic orthodoxy**.
   - "Nicene trinitarianism is not a negotiable starting point, but the doctrinal boundary." (Credo Magazine, 2016)

5. **Critique of EFS/ERAS**
   - Argues that EFS/ERAS introduces a problematic eternal hierarchy within the Trinity.
   - Warns that such views risk undermining the **co-equality** of the divine persons.
   - Points out that EFS is not found in the **church fathers** or classical confessions.
   - Calls for careful distinction between **biblical exegesis** and systematic theology.
   - "Eternal functional subordination is neither necessary nor safe for trinitarian theology." (Advancing Trinitarian Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Fred Sanders has become a leading evangelical voice advocating for **classical trinitarianism** in the context of contemporary debates over EFS. His work has helped clarify the boundaries between **economic** and **immanent** distinctions within the Godhead, reinforcing the importance of **Nicene categories** for modern theology. Sanders’s interventions have shaped evangelical discourse, encouraging a return to historic orthodoxy and cautioning against innovations that threaten the unity and equality of the Trinity.
