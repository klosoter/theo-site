# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til did not directly address the modern **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** debates, but his robust doctrine of the **Trinity** and insistence on the **ontological equality** of the divine persons have been influential in shaping Reformed responses to such controversies. Van Til emphasized the **unity and diversity** within the Godhead, rejecting any notion that would compromise the full **deity** or **co-equality** of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

- "We must maintain both the unity and the diversity in the Godhead with equal emphasis." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Christian Theistic Ethics
- The Doctrine of Scripture
- The Reformed Pastor and Modern Thought (secondary, for analysis of Van Til’s Trinitarianism)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Equality of the Divine Persons**
    - All three persons of the Trinity share the same **divine essence**.
    - No person is subordinate in being or attributes to another.
    - Any subordination is strictly related to **economic roles**, not ontology.
    - Rejects any eternal subordination that would imply inequality.
    - "The persons of the Trinity are co-equal and co-eternal." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Unity and Diversity in the Trinity**
    - The one God exists eternally in three distinct persons.
    - Emphasizes both **unity of essence** and **distinction of persons**.
    - Avoids both **modalism** (denial of real distinctions) and **tritheism** (denial of unity).
    - The diversity within the Godhead is as ultimate as the unity.
    - "Unity and plurality are equally ultimate in the Godhead." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Rejection of Ontological Subordination**
    - Subordination in the Trinity is only in terms of **role** or **function** in redemptive history.
    - Eternal subordination of the Son or Spirit in being is seen as a denial of orthodox Trinitarianism.
    - The **Father, Son, and Spirit** are equal in power, glory, and majesty.
    - Any eternal subordination undermines the doctrine of **homoousios**.
    - "There is no subordination of essence in the Trinity." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Analogical Knowledge and Mystery**
    - Human knowledge of the Trinity is always **analogical**, not exhaustive.
    - The mystery of the Trinity must be preserved without contradiction.
    - Attempts to rationalize the Trinity often lead to heresy.
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** shapes all theological reflection on the Godhead.
    - "We must think God’s thoughts after Him, analogically, not univocally." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Trinitarian Foundation for Authority and Order**
    - The **Trinitarian relations** ground all created order and authority structures.
    - Human authority is not a direct reflection of intra-Trinitarian relations.
    - The **economic Trinity** reveals God’s works, not His eternal being.
    - Cautions against projecting human social structures onto the Godhead.
    - "The Trinity is the archetype of all true unity and diversity, but not in a way that allows for subordination in being." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s rigorous defense of the **ontological equality** of the Trinity has been foundational for Reformed critiques of the EFS position. His insistence on the equal ultimacy of unity and diversity in the Godhead has shaped contemporary discussions, warning against any eternal subordination that would compromise orthodox **Trinitarianism**. While not engaging EFS debates directly, Van Til’s theological categories remain central to ongoing evangelical and Reformed conversations about the doctrine of God.
