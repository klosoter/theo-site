# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate classic **Reformed doctrine** on the **Trinity**, emphasizing the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the divine persons. While these confessions do not directly address the modern **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** debates, their formulations strongly affirm the **unity of essence** and **inseparable operations** of the Father, Son, and Spirit, leaving little room for any eternal subordination of role or authority within the Godhead.

- "In this one only Godhead there are three persons, distinguished by their properties, namely, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 8–11
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), Lord’s Days 8–9
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), Rejection of Errors, First Head
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Beeke & Ferguson)
- The Doctrine of God: A Historical Survey (Richard Muller)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Equality of the Divine Persons**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit are each fully and equally **God**, sharing the same **divine essence**.
    - No person possesses greater or lesser **authority** or **glory** within the Godhead.
    - Distinctions among the persons are only by their **personal properties** (paternity, filiation, procession).
    - The confessions reject any hint of **subordinationism** in the eternal relations.
    - "The Father is the cause, origin, and beginning of all things visible and invisible; the Son is the Word, wisdom, and image of the Father; the Holy Ghost is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father and the Son." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

2. **Unity of Divine Will and Operation**
    - The divine will is singular; all three persons act inseparably in creation and redemption.
    - There is no eternal distinction of **authority** or **function** within the Godhead.
    - The works of God ad extra are undivided, reflecting the unity of essence.
    - Any distinction in roles pertains to the **economy of salvation**, not to the eternal Trinity.
    - "The Father has created us by his power, the Son has redeemed us by his blood, the Holy Ghost sanctifies us by his dwelling in our hearts." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 8)

3. **Distinction of Persons by Relations of Origin**
    - The Father is unbegotten, the Son is eternally begotten, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.
    - These distinctions do not imply hierarchy or subordination.
    - The relations of origin are the only basis for distinguishing the persons.
    - The confessions explicitly deny any confusion or division of the divine essence.
    - "The Father is the eternal Father of the Son, the Son the eternal Son of the Father, and the Holy Ghost the eternal Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son." (Belgic Confession, Art. 10)

4. **Rejection of All Forms of Subordinationism**
    - The confessions explicitly reject Arianism and all forms of subordination among the persons.
    - Any teaching that makes the Son or Spirit less than fully God is anathematized.
    - The Son’s submission in the economy of redemption is not projected into eternity.
    - The equality of persons is a non-negotiable aspect of Reformed **Trinitarianism**.
    - "Therefore, we confess, against all heresies and errors, that the Son is true and eternal God, the Almighty, whom we invoke, worship, and serve." (Belgic Confession, Art. 10)

5. **Economic Roles Do Not Imply Eternal Subordination**
    - The Son’s incarnate obedience is a matter of the **economy**, not of eternal relation.
    - The confessions distinguish between the **immanent** and **economic** Trinity.
    - The Son’s submission is voluntary and temporal, not ontological or eternal.
    - The Three Forms of Unity do not support reading economic roles back into the eternal Godhead.
    - "He is and remains true and eternal God, even though he assumed human nature." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 17)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have decisively shaped **Reformed Trinitarian theology**, providing a robust confessional standard that resists all forms of **Eternal Functional Subordination**. Their careful articulation of the unity and equality of the divine persons has been foundational for later Reformed responses to contemporary EFS debates. These confessions continue to serve as a theological anchor, ensuring that the doctrine of the Trinity remains grounded in the historic, catholic, and Reformed tradition.
