# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner rejected the notion of **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** within the **Trinity**, emphasizing the co-equality and mutuality of the divine persons. He argued that any form of **subordinationism** undermines the unity and deity of the **Son** and **Spirit**, insisting that distinctions in the Godhead are rooted in **personal relations**, not in eternal hierarchy or function.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity excludes every kind of subordinationism within the Godhead." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Eternal Subordination**
   - Brunner maintained that all three persons of the **Trinity** are fully and equally God.
   - He opposed any suggestion that the **Son** or **Spirit** are eternally subordinate in role or function.
   - Subordination is only applicable to the **economic Trinity** (in salvation history), not the **immanent Trinity**.
   - He viewed EFS as a threat to the unity and deity of Christ.
   - "There is no subordination of essence or function in the eternal Trinity." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Personal Distinctions Without Hierarchy**
   - The persons are distinguished by their **relations of origin** (Father begets, Son is begotten, Spirit proceeds).
   - These distinctions do not entail any form of eternal authority or submission.
   - Brunner emphasized the mutuality and reciprocity within the Godhead.
   - He warned against projecting human social or gender roles onto the Trinity.
   - "The distinctions in the Trinity are not distinctions of rank or function, but of personal relation." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

3. **Economic Subordination Only in Salvation History**
   - Brunner acknowledged a functional subordination in the **economy of redemption**.
   - This subordination is temporal and voluntary, not eternal or ontological.
   - The Son submits to the Father only in the context of the incarnation and mission.
   - The economic roles do not reflect eternal realities within the Godhead.
   - "The Son’s obedience is an act of His freedom in the history of salvation, not an eternal subordination." (The Mediator)

4. **Safeguarding Divine Unity**
   - Brunner insisted that any form of EFS risks dividing the divine essence.
   - He argued that the **oneness of God** is foundational to Christian doctrine.
   - The three persons share the same will, power, and glory.
   - Any eternal subordination would imply a lesser deity, which is heretical.
   - "The unity of the Godhead is absolute; no person is less than fully God." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

5. **Critique of Modern Subordinationist Trends**
   - Brunner critiqued contemporary attempts to ground human social structures in the Trinity.
   - He saw such moves as speculative and lacking biblical warrant.
   - He warned that EFS can be used to justify problematic anthropological or ecclesial hierarchies.
   - Brunner called for a return to classical Trinitarian formulations.
   - "To read human authority structures into the Trinity is to misunderstand both God and man." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s robust rejection of **Eternal Functional Subordination** has influenced modern Trinitarian theology, especially among those wary of importing social or gender hierarchies into the doctrine of God. His insistence on the **co-equality** and mutuality of the divine persons remains a touchstone for critics of EFS. Brunner’s work continues to be cited in debates over the relationship between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**, and his warnings against subordinationism have shaped both academic and ecclesial discussions.
