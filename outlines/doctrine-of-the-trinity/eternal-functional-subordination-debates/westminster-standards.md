# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a robust doctrine of the **Trinity** grounded in the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the divine persons, explicitly rejecting any notion of **eternal subordination** within the Godhead. The Standards affirm the **unity of essence** and **distinction of persons** without subordination of will, power, or glory, thus providing a confessional bulwark against the idea of **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**.

- "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost." (Westminster Confession of Faith 2.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- Westminster Larger Catechism
- Westminster Shorter Catechism
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended)
- The Directory for Public Worship (for Trinitarian doxology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Divine Essence**
   - Asserts that the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** are of one and the same **substance**.
   - Denies any division or hierarchy in the **divine being**.
   - Emphasizes **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the persons.
   - The divine will, power, and glory are fully shared by all three persons.
   - "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity." (WCF 2.3)

2. **Distinction of Persons Without Subordination**
   - The persons are distinguished by their **personal properties** (paternity, filiation, procession).
   - No person is before or after another in **rank** or **authority**.
   - Rejects any eternal subordination of function or role within the Godhead.
   - The distinctions do not imply inequality or inferiority.
   - "The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son." (WCF 2.3)

3. **Rejection of Eternal Functional Subordination**
   - The Standards do not teach or imply **eternal subordination** of the Son or Spirit.
   - Any subordination is limited to the **economic Trinity** (redemptive history), not the **immanent Trinity**.
   - The Son’s obedience is voluntary and pertains to his **mediatorial office**, not his eternal personhood.
   - Eternal relations are of **origin**, not of authority or function.
   - "Equal in power and glory." (WSC Q.6)

4. **Economic Roles Do Not Imply Ontological Subordination**
   - The Son’s submission in redemption is a matter of **covenantal arrangement**, not eternal hierarchy.
   - The **mediatorial work** of Christ is distinct from his eternal divine status.
   - The **missions** of the Son and Spirit reflect the order of origin, not subordination of will.
   - The economic Trinity is grounded in the ontological equality of the persons.
   - "The Son, being God, and equal with the Father, did, when the fulness of time was come, take upon him man’s nature." (WLC Q.36)

5. **Safeguarding the Doctrine of God**
   - The Standards aim to protect the **simplicity** and **immutability** of God.
   - Any teaching of eternal subordination is viewed as a threat to **orthodox Trinitarianism**.
   - The language of the Standards is intentionally precise to avoid **Arian** or **subordinationist** tendencies.
   - The confession upholds the **Nicene** and **Athanasius** creeds’ Trinitarian formulations.
   - "There is but one only, the living and true God." (WCF 2.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have provided a confessional anchor for Reformed churches, decisively shaping their rejection of **Eternal Functional Subordination** as inconsistent with classical **Trinitarian orthodoxy**. Their careful articulation of the **unity and equality** of the divine persons continues to inform contemporary debates, serving as a benchmark for evaluating new proposals about the Trinity. The Standards’ influence endures in both doctrinal formulations and ecclesiastical boundaries regarding the doctrine of God.
