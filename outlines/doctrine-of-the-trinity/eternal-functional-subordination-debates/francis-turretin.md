# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, firmly upheld the **ontological equality** of the divine persons while distinguishing their **personal properties** and **eternal relations of origin**. In addressing issues later associated with the **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** debates, Turretin rejected any notion of subordination in the **divine will** or **essence**, insisting that distinctions among the persons pertain only to their **mode of subsistence** and not to authority or function.

- "There is no subordination of one person to another as to essence or will, but only a distinction of order as to mode of subsisting and origin." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Disputationes Theologicae
- Selected Questions on the Trinity (within Institutes)
- Secondary: Richard A. Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (for context on Turretin’s Trinitarianism)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Equality of the Divine Persons**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit share the same **divine essence** without hierarchy.
    - Any distinction is not of nature or will, but of **personal relations**.
    - Rejects all forms of **subordinationism** in the Godhead.
    - The unity of will and power is absolute among the persons.
    - "The three persons are distinguished not by degree or dignity, but by order and mode of subsisting." (Institutes)

2. **Distinction by Eternal Relations of Origin**
    - The Father is unbegotten, the Son is begotten, and the Spirit proceeds.
    - These relations do not imply functional subordination or authority structures.
    - The order is logical, not ontological or functional.
    - Each person possesses the whole divine essence.
    - "The order among the persons is one of origin, not of authority or will." (Institutes)

3. **Rejection of Eternal Functional Subordination**
    - No eternal subordination of will or authority exists among the persons.
    - Any subordination is limited to the Son’s incarnate mission, not his eternal status.
    - The Son’s obedience pertains to the **economy of redemption**, not the immanent Trinity.
    - Eternal subordination would compromise **divine simplicity** and unity.
    - "The subordination of the Son is economical, not essential or eternal." (Institutes)

4. **Divine Simplicity and Unity of Will**
    - The will of God is numerically one, not divided among the persons.
    - All actions ad extra are undivided, performed by the whole Trinity.
    - The persons do not possess separate faculties of will or authority.
    - Any distinction of will would introduce composition into God.
    - "There is one will in God, not three; otherwise, the unity of essence would be destroyed." (Institutes)

5. **Economic Subordination in the Work of Redemption**
    - The Son’s submission is voluntary and pertains to his mediatorial office.
    - This subordination is temporal, not eternal or ontological.
    - The economic roles reflect the order of origin, not an eternal hierarchy.
    - The Son’s obedience is a function of the incarnation, not of his deity.
    - "The Son is subordinate as mediator, not as God; the subordination is of office, not of nature." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of **Trinitarian orthodoxy** has shaped the Reformed tradition’s resistance to any form of **eternal functional subordination** within the Godhead. His careful distinction between **ontological equality** and **economic roles** remains foundational for confessional Reformed theology. Modern EFS debates frequently cite Turretin as a representative of classical doctrine, emphasizing the dangers of conflating economic subordination with eternal relations. His influence endures in contemporary discussions on the Trinity, especially regarding the unity and simplicity of the divine will.
