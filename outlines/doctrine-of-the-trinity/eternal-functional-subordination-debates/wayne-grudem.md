# Wayne Grudem (1948– )

Wayne Grudem is a leading proponent of **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** within contemporary evangelical theology. He argues that the **Son** is eternally and willingly subordinate to the **Father** in role and authority, while maintaining full **ontological equality** within the **Trinity**. Grudem’s position has sparked significant debate regarding the implications for **Trinitarian doctrine** and **gender roles**.

- "The Son is equal in deity to the Father, but subordinate in role." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine (1994, 2020)
- Evangelical Feminism and Biblical Truth (2004)
- The Role Relationship of Men and Women (1985, in Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood)
- "Biblical Evidence for the Eternal Submission of the Son to the Father" (Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, 2001)
- The Trinity: An Introduction (2023)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Functional Subordination of the Son**
    - The Son eternally submits to the Father's authority in role, not essence.
    - This subordination is not limited to the incarnation but is an eternal reality.
    - The distinction is between **role** (function) and **being** (essence).
    - The Son’s submission is voluntary and loving, not coerced.
    - "The Father has eternally had authority over the Son, and the Son has eternally been subject to the Father." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Ontological Equality within the Trinity**
    - All three persons of the Trinity share the same divine nature.
    - There is no hierarchy of being or value among Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - Functional subordination does not imply inferiority.
    - The doctrine upholds **Nicene orthodoxy** regarding the full deity of the Son.
    - "There is no difference in deity, attributes, or essential nature." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Biblical Basis for EFS**
    - Grudem appeals to passages such as 1 Corinthians 11:3 and John 5:19.
    - He argues that Scripture consistently portrays the Son as subject to the Father.
    - The pattern of sending and obedience is seen as eternal, not merely economic.
    - The New Testament language of "Father" and "Son" reflects eternal realities.
    - "The consistent testimony of Scripture is that the Son is subject to the Father." (Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood)

4. **Implications for Gender Roles**
    - Grudem connects EFS to **complementarianism** in human relationships.
    - He argues that the Trinity models authority and submission without inequality.
    - Male headship in the church and home reflects the eternal relationship of Father and Son.
    - This analogy is used to defend traditional gender roles as rooted in creation and the Godhead.
    - "The equality and differences between men and women reflect the equality and differences in the Trinity." (Evangelical Feminism and Biblical Truth)

5. **Rejection of Ontological Subordination and Arianism**
    - Grudem insists EFS does not entail subordination of essence or being.
    - He explicitly rejects any form of **Arianism** or denial of the Son’s full deity.
    - The distinction is strictly between eternal roles, not nature.
    - He affirms the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the three persons.
    - "This is not Arianism, because the Son is equal in being to the Father." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Wayne Grudem’s advocacy for **Eternal Functional Subordination** has significantly shaped evangelical discussions on the **Trinity** and gender roles, especially within complementarian circles. His work has provoked robust debate, with critics challenging the orthodoxy and implications of EFS for classical Trinitarian doctrine. Despite controversy, Grudem’s writings remain influential in both academic and church contexts, ensuring that the EFS debate continues to be a central issue in contemporary systematic theology.
