# Kevin Giles (1940– )

Kevin Giles is a leading critic of **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** within contemporary Trinitarian debates. He argues that EFS undermines the **doctrine of the Trinity** as confessed in **Nicene orthodoxy**, insisting on the full **equality of the divine persons** in both essence and authority, and warning against any subordinationism in the immanent Trinity.

- "The idea that the Son is eternally subordinated in role or function to the Father is not found in the Nicene Creed or in the Bible." ("The Rise and Fall of the Complementarian Doctrine of the Trinity")

## Key Works

- The Trinity & Subordinationism: The Doctrine of God & the Contemporary Gender Debate (2002)
- Jesus and the Father: Modern Evangelicals Reinvent the Doctrine of the Trinity (2006)
- The Rise and Fall of the Complementarian Doctrine of the Trinity (2017)
- What the Bible Actually Teaches on Women (2018)
- "The Eternal Generation of the Son and Biblical Interpretation: A Critique of the Complementarian Doctrine of the Trinity" (Priscilla Papers, 2012)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Eternal Functional Subordination**
   - Argues that EFS introduces a form of **subordinationism** into the doctrine of God.
   - Maintains that all three persons of the Trinity are equal in authority and power.
   - Critiques EFS as a recent innovation, not grounded in the **historic creeds**.
   - Warns that EFS blurs the distinction between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.
   - "To speak of the Son as eternally subordinate in function is to compromise the full equality of the divine persons." (The Trinity & Subordinationism)

2. **Defense of Nicene Orthodoxy**
   - Upholds the **Nicene Creed** as the definitive statement on Trinitarian relations.
   - Emphasizes the **eternal generation of the Son** as the only legitimate distinction of persons.
   - Insists that the **one will** of God is shared equally by Father, Son, and Spirit.
   - Argues that the **homoousion** (same essence) entails equality of authority.
   - "The Nicene Creed allows no subordination of the Son to the Father except in the incarnation." (Jesus and the Father)

3. **Distinction Between Immanent and Economic Trinity**
   - Asserts that distinctions of role or function apply only to the **economic Trinity**.
   - The **immanent Trinity** is characterized by perfect equality and reciprocity.
   - Warns that reading economic roles back into the immanent Trinity leads to error.
   - Emphasizes that the **missions** of the Son and Spirit are temporal, not eternal subordination.
   - "The functional subordination of the Son is limited to the incarnation and mission, not to eternity." (The Trinity & Subordinationism)

4. **Critique of Gender Complementarianism’s Use of EFS**
   - Identifies EFS as a theological justification for **gender hierarchy** in church and home.
   - Argues that linking gender roles to Trinitarian relations is a category mistake.
   - Warns that this approach distorts both **Trinitarian theology** and **biblical anthropology**.
   - Advocates for the **equality of men and women** based on the equality within the Trinity.
   - "The subordination of women cannot be justified by appeal to the Trinity without distorting both doctrines." (What the Bible Actually Teaches on Women)

5. **Commitment to Biblical and Historical Theology**
   - Insists that the **biblical witness** affirms the full equality of the Son with the Father.
   - Engages the **church fathers** and historic confessions to demonstrate the novelty of EFS.
   - Argues that orthodox Trinitarianism is both **biblically faithful** and historically rooted.
   - Encourages careful exegesis and doctrinal retrieval in Trinitarian debates.
   - "The church has always confessed the co-equality of the three divine persons, grounded in Scripture and tradition." (The Rise and Fall of the Complementarian Doctrine of the Trinity)

## Legacy and Impact

Kevin Giles has played a pivotal role in challenging the **Eternal Functional Subordination** position within evangelical and Reformed circles. His work has prompted renewed attention to **Nicene orthodoxy** and the dangers of importing social or gender hierarchies into Trinitarian theology. Giles’s scholarship has influenced both academic and ecclesial discussions, urging a return to the classical doctrine of the Trinity and cautioning against innovations that threaten the unity and equality of the divine persons.
