# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann did not directly engage the **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** debates, as his primary focus was on **demythologization**, **New Testament Christology**, and the existential interpretation of **revelation**. Bultmann’s approach to the **Trinity** and **Christology** emphasized the historical and existential encounter with God in Christ, rather than ontological or eternal distinctions within the Godhead. His theology thus stands apart from the EFS debates, prioritizing the proclamation of **kerygma** over speculative Trinitarian hierarchy.

- "We cannot speak of God otherwise than by speaking of what he does to man." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941, essay)
- "Primitive Christianity in its Contemporary Setting" (1956)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Scripture must be interpreted existentially, not through ancient cosmologies.
    - Mythological language is a vehicle for existential truth, not metaphysical speculation.
    - The focus is on the **kerygma**—the proclamation of Christ as the decisive event.
    - Trinitarian or Christological debates are secondary to the existential encounter.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Revelation**
    - Revelation is not propositional but an event in personal existence.
    - The meaning of Christ is encountered, not deduced from eternal relations.
    - The **Word of God** confronts the hearer in the present.
    - Eternal subordination or ontological hierarchy is not a focus.
    - "Revelation is not a communication of truths, but an event in which man is confronted by God." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Christology Focused on the Proclaimed Christ**
    - Christ is known in the act of proclamation, not in metaphysical speculation.
    - The New Testament presents functional, not ontological, distinctions.
    - The significance of Christ is in his existential impact, not eternal roles.
    - The **Son’s obedience** is understood historically, not eternally.
    - "The Christ who is preached is the Christ who encounters us here and now." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Rejection of Speculative Trinitarianism**
    - The New Testament does not present a developed doctrine of the Trinity.
    - Trinitarian language is functional, describing God’s actions in salvation history.
    - Eternal relations of authority and submission are not central concerns.
    - The focus is on the unity of God’s saving act in Christ.
    - "The New Testament does not contain the doctrine of the Trinity in the later sense." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Priority of Faith and Decision**
    - Faith is a personal response to the existential call of God.
    - Theological debates about eternal subordination are less relevant to faith.
    - The individual’s decision in response to the **kerygma** is paramount.
    - Theological constructs must serve the proclamation, not distract from it.
    - "Faith is decision, not assent to doctrine." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential and **demythologizing** approach has had a profound influence on modern theology, shifting the focus from ontological debates such as EFS to the existential encounter with Christ. His work challenged traditional formulations of **Trinitarian** and **Christological** doctrine by emphasizing proclamation and personal faith over metaphysical speculation. While his theology stands apart from the EFS debates, it has shaped the broader context in which such discussions are received, especially in critical scholarship. Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between biblical language, doctrine, and existential meaning.
