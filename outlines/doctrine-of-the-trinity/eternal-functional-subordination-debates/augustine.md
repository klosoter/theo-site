# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **Trinity** is foundational for later Christian thought and is often cited in debates over **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)**. He strongly affirmed the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the divine persons, rejecting any notion of ontological subordination within the **Godhead**. Augustine’s careful distinction between **relations of origin** and **divine essence** has shaped orthodox responses to claims of eternal subordination among the persons of the Trinity.

- "In this Trinity, a unity is in the equality of the substance, and the distinction in the mutual relations." (On the Trinity, I.4)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Confessiones (Confessions)
- Enchiridion
- Letters (Epistulae), especially those addressing Trinitarian controversies
- City of God (De Civitate Dei), relevant sections on the divine nature

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Equality of Divine Persons**
    - The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are fully and equally **God**.
    - No person possesses a lesser or subordinate **divine nature**.
    - Distinctions among persons are relational, not ontological.
    - Any subordination is only in terms of **mission** or **sending**, not essence.
    - "The Father is not greater than the Son in respect to divinity, but only in respect to being Father." (On the Trinity, I.7)

2. **Relations of Origin**
    - The Son is eternally **begotten** of the Father; the Spirit **proceeds** from the Father (and the Son).
    - These relations define the persons without implying hierarchy.
    - The **relations of origin** are the only distinctions within the Trinity.
    - The divine essence remains undivided and identical in all three persons.
    - "The Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God; and all three are one God... but by relation they are three." (On the Trinity, V.9)

3. **Unity of Essence**
    - The divine **substance** is simple, indivisible, and shared fully by each person.
    - There is no gradation or division within the **Godhead**.
    - All divine attributes are possessed equally by Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The unity of essence precludes any eternal subordination of function or authority.
    - "There is one essence, one substance, one nature, one God." (On the Trinity, VII.6)

4. **Temporal Missions vs. Eternal Processions**
    - The **sending** of the Son and Spirit in salvation history reflects eternal relations, not subordination.
    - Temporal missions are expressions of the persons’ eternal origins, not of authority structures.
    - The **economic Trinity** reveals, but does not alter, the **immanent Trinity**.
    - Any subordination in the economy is voluntary and temporary.
    - "The Son is sent by the Father, not because He is less, but because He is begotten." (On the Trinity, II.9)

5. **Rejection of Ontological Subordination**
    - Augustine explicitly denies any eternal hierarchy of authority or will within the Trinity.
    - The will and power of the three persons are one and the same.
    - Any language of subordination is accommodated to human understanding.
    - Eternal subordination would undermine the **consubstantiality** of the persons.
    - "There is no inequality in the Trinity, nor any difference of essence or will." (On the Trinity, I.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s robust defense of the **co-equality** and **unity** of the divine persons remains a cornerstone in orthodox Trinitarian theology and a primary resource in critiquing **Eternal Functional Subordination**. His distinctions between **relations of origin** and **essence** have shaped both Western and ecumenical understandings of the Trinity. Later Reformed and patristic theologians consistently appeal to Augustine to reject any notion of eternal subordination within the Godhead, making his work central to contemporary debates on this topic.
