# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner’s approach to the **Trinity** is marked by his insistence on the unity of the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**, famously articulated in his "Rahner’s Rule." He firmly rejected any notion of **eternal functional subordination** within the Godhead, arguing that distinctions in the **missions** of the divine persons do not imply ontological or eternal subordination. For Rahner, the **relations of origin** are the only basis for distinction within the Trinity, and all three persons share the same divine will and essence.

- "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity." (The Trinity, 1986)

## Key Works

- The Trinity (1967; English trans. 1986)
- Foundations of Christian Faith (1976)
- "Remarks on the Dogmatic Treatise 'De Trinitate'" in Theological Investigations, Vol. 4
- "The Doctrine of the Trinity" in Theological Investigations, Vol. 1

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Immanent and Economic Trinity**
    - The **immanent Trinity** (God in himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God in salvation history) are inseparable.
    - There is no hidden God behind the God revealed in salvation history.
    - The self-communication of God in history truly reveals God's eternal being.
    - Any subordination in the economy does not reflect eternal relations within the Godhead.
    - "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa." (The Trinity)

2. **Rejection of Eternal Functional Subordination**
    - The divine persons are distinguished only by **relations of origin**, not by function or hierarchy.
    - Any subordination is temporal and pertains only to the missions, not to eternal being.
    - The Son and Spirit are not eternally subordinate in will or authority to the Father.
    - Eternal subordination would compromise the consubstantiality and equality of the persons.
    - "There is no subordination of the Son or the Spirit to the Father in the immanent Trinity." (The Trinity)

3. **Emphasis on Consubstantiality and Equality**
    - All three persons share the same **divine essence** fully and equally.
    - The divine will and action are undivided among the persons.
    - Any distinction of roles in salvation history does not imply inequality.
    - The **homoousion** (same substance) is foundational for understanding the Trinity.
    - "The three persons are one God and are equal in all things except their relations of origin." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Trinitarian Missions Reflect, Not Constitute, Eternal Relations**
    - The **missions** of the Son and Spirit reveal, but do not create, their eternal relations of origin.
    - The sending of the Son and Spirit in history is grounded in their eternal processions.
    - Functional distinctions in the economy are not to be read back into the immanent Trinity.
    - The missions are revelatory, not constitutive, of the persons’ identities.
    - "The sending of the Son and the Spirit is the historical manifestation of their eternal origin." (The Trinity)

5. **Pastoral and Soteriological Focus**
    - The doctrine of the Trinity is central for understanding **salvation** and Christian experience.
    - The unity of God’s action in history assures believers of God’s self-giving love.
    - Trinitarian doctrine must be meaningful for faith and not merely speculative.
    - Any teaching that introduces hierarchy into the Trinity threatens the assurance of salvation.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not an abstract speculation but the expression of God’s saving self-communication." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s **Trinitarian theology** has profoundly shaped modern Catholic and ecumenical thought, especially through his emphasis on the unity of the immanent and economic Trinity. His rejection of **eternal functional subordination** has been influential in contemporary debates, providing a strong theological basis for the equality of the divine persons. Rahner’s work continues to challenge theologians to ground Trinitarian doctrine in both biblical revelation and the lived experience of salvation. His legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the relevance of the Trinity for Christian life and doctrine.
