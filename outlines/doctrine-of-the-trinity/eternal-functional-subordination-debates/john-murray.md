# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray did not directly engage the contemporary **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** debates, but his robust articulation of **Trinitarian orthodoxy** and the **doctrine of the Son’s incarnation** has been influential in Reformed responses to EFS. Murray emphasized the **ontological equality** of the divine persons and insisted that distinctions of role or function within the **Trinity** pertain to the **economic order** and not to the eternal relations of the Godhead.

- "The subordination of the Son in respect of his mediatorial office must not be construed to mean inferiority of essence or dignity." ("Redemption—Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- "Redemption—Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray," Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (1959–1965)
- "The Trinity" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "Jesus, the Son of God" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological Equality of the Divine Persons**
    - The **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** share the same divine essence.
    - Any subordination is strictly economic, not ontological.
    - The Son’s submission is related to his incarnate mission, not his eternal being.
    - Rejects any implication of eternal subordination of essence or glory.
    - "There is no subordination within the Trinity in respect of deity, essence, or nature." ("The Trinity")

2. **Economic Subordination in the Work of Redemption**
    - The Son’s obedience and submission are tied to his mediatorial role.
    - Economic roles do not imply an eternal hierarchy within the Godhead.
    - The **incarnation** is the context for the Son’s functional subordination.
    - The Son’s submission is voluntary and for the purpose of redemption.
    - "The subordination of the Son is that of function and office, not of nature or being." ("Redemption—Accomplished and Applied")

3. **Rejection of Eternal Functional Subordination**
    - Eternal subordination of the Son is inconsistent with Nicene orthodoxy.
    - The Son’s obedience is temporal, not eternal.
    - The **eternal generation** of the Son affirms equality, not subordination.
    - Any eternal subordination undermines the unity of the Godhead.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity excludes all notions of inferiority or subordination as touching the essence of the Son." ("The Trinity")

4. **Emphasis on Classical Trinitarian Formulations**
    - Upholds the **Nicene Creed** and classical confessions.
    - Affirms the **homoousion** of the Son with the Father.
    - Stresses the importance of **inseparable operations**.
    - Warns against speculative distinctions that divide the Godhead.
    - "The unity of the Godhead is not to be compromised by distinctions of function." ("The Trinity")

5. **Christ’s Mediatorial Role as the Context for Submission**
    - The Son’s submission is rooted in his voluntary assumption of human nature.
    - The **mediatorial office** is temporal and redemptive.
    - The Son’s obedience is a function of the incarnation, not of eternal deity.
    - The distinction between **immanent** and **economic Trinity** is crucial.
    - "It is only in the economy of redemption that we can speak of the Son’s subordination." ("Redemption—Accomplished and Applied")

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s careful distinction between **ontological equality** and **economic subordination** has shaped Reformed critiques of EFS and reinforced classical Trinitarian doctrine. His writings are frequently cited in contemporary debates as a standard for maintaining the unity and coequality of the divine persons. Murray’s influence persists in both academic and ecclesial settings, providing a clear framework for understanding the relationship between the **immanent and economic Trinity**.
