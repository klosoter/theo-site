# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards affirm the **doctrine of the Trinity** as articulated in the **ecumenical creeds**, explicitly endorsing the **Nicene Creed**’s teaching on the procession of the Spirit, including the **Filioque** clause (“and the Son”). They uphold the authority of the **Apostles’ Creed**, **Nicene Creed**, and **Athanasian Creed** as faithful summaries of **Scriptural teaching**, while subordinating all creeds to the supreme authority of **Scripture** itself.

- "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost." (Westminster Confession of Faith II.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- Westminster Larger Catechism
- Westminster Shorter Catechism
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on creeds and confessions)
- The Westminster Assembly’s examination of the ecumenical creeds (as referenced in minutes and historical studies)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Orthodoxy**
   - Affirms the **one essence and three persons** of the Trinity.
   - Explicitly teaches the **co-equality and co-eternity** of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
   - Draws on the **ecumenical creeds** as faithful summaries of biblical doctrine.
   - Rejects any subordinationism or denial of full divinity within the Godhead.
   - "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity." (WCF II.3)

2. **Filioque Affirmation**
   - Endorses the **procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son**.
   - Follows the Western tradition’s reading of the **Nicene Creed** with the Filioque.
   - Sees the Filioque as consistent with **biblical revelation** (e.g., John 15:26; Gal. 4:6).
   - Views the Filioque as a safeguard for the **full divinity of the Son**.
   - "The Holy Ghost...proceeding from the Father and the Son." (WCF II.3)

3. **Authority of Scripture over Creeds**
   - Asserts that **Scripture alone** is the ultimate rule of faith and practice.
   - Affirms creeds only insofar as they are **agreeable to Scripture**.
   - Uses the ecumenical creeds as **subordinate standards**.
   - Encourages continual testing of all doctrine by the **Word of God**.
   - "The supreme judge by which all controversies of religion are to be determined...can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture." (WCF I.10)

4. **Reception of Ecumenical Creeds**
   - Receives the **Apostles’, Nicene, and Athanasian Creeds** as orthodox.
   - Regards these creeds as **summaries of the Christian faith**.
   - Employs the creeds in **catechesis and worship**.
   - Recognizes their historical role in defining **orthodoxy**.
   - "The creeds of the ancient Church...are to be received and believed, as agreeable to the Word of God." (Larger Catechism, Q. 113, paraphrased from historical context)

5. **Ecumenical Unity and Distinction**
   - Values the **unity of the catholic (universal) church** in core doctrines.
   - Maintains distinctives where **Reformed theology** diverges from other traditions.
   - Seeks **continuity with the early church** while reforming errors.
   - Engages in **ecumenical dialogue** on the basis of shared creedal commitments.
   - "The visible Church...consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion." (WCF XXV.2)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have shaped **Reformed confessional identity** by rooting Trinitarian doctrine in both **Scripture** and the **ecumenical creeds**, including the Filioque. Their approach has influenced Presbyterian and Reformed churches worldwide, reinforcing the authority of the ancient creeds while insisting on the primacy of Scripture. This balance has enabled ongoing engagement with broader Christian traditions and contributed to the enduring significance of the **Filioque** in Western theology.
