# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirmed the **Filioque** clause, emphasizing the **procession of the Holy Spirit from both the Father and the Son** as essential to the doctrine of the **Trinity**. He upheld the authority of the **ecumenical creeds**—especially the **Nicene Creed**—as faithful summaries of biblical truth, while insisting that Scripture alone is the ultimate norm. Calvin’s approach sought to maintain both **catholicity** and **Reformed distinctives** in articulating the doctrine of God.

- "We say, indeed, that the Spirit proceeds from the Father, but not without the Son." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, I.13.18)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 13)
- Commentary on the Gospel According to John (notably on John 15:26)
- Catechism of the Church of Geneva
- Confession of Faith (1536)
- Theological Treatises (selected letters and tracts on Trinitarian doctrine)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Filioque**
    - Calvin explicitly supports the **procession of the Spirit from both the Father and the Son**.
    - He interprets biblical passages (e.g., John 15:26) as teaching the **double procession**.
    - Calvin sees the Filioque as safeguarding the **co-equality and consubstantiality** of the Son with the Father.
    - He rejects any subordinationism implied by denying the Son’s role in the Spirit’s procession.
    - "For the Spirit is sent by the Son as well as by the Father." (Institutes I.13.18)

2. **Scripture as the Norm for Creeds**
    - Calvin holds that **ecumenical creeds** are authoritative only insofar as they agree with Scripture.
    - He values the creeds as faithful expositions but insists on **sola Scriptura**.
    - Calvin critiques any tradition that elevates creeds above biblical teaching.
    - He uses the creeds to refute heresies, provided they are scripturally grounded.
    - "Let us remember that the creed is not above the Word of God." (Institutes I.13.3)

3. **Reception of Ecumenical Creeds**
    - Calvin affirms the **Apostles’ Creed**, **Nicene Creed**, and **Athanasian Creed** as orthodox.
    - He regards these creeds as consensus statements of the **ancient church**.
    - Calvin incorporates the creeds into catechesis and worship in Geneva.
    - He interprets the creeds through a **Reformed theological lens**.
    - "We willingly embrace the three creeds: Apostles’, Nicene, and Athanasian." (Institutes I.13.4)

4. **Trinitarian Clarity and Anti-Modalism**
    - Calvin insists on the **personal distinctions** within the Trinity.
    - He uses the Filioque to clarify the relationship between the **persons**.
    - Calvin opposes both **modalism** and **tritheism**.
    - He stresses the unity of **essence** and distinction of **persons**.
    - "We hold, therefore, that in the one essence of God, there are three persons." (Institutes I.13.2)

5. **Ecumenical Engagement and Reformed Identity**
    - Calvin seeks to maintain **catholicity** by affirming the core doctrines of the early church.
    - He adapts the language of the creeds to fit **Reformed confessional standards**.
    - Calvin engages with both Eastern and Western traditions, though he sides with the Western view on the Filioque.
    - He encourages unity on essential doctrines while allowing for diversity in non-essentials.
    - "We do not rashly depart from the consent of the ancient church." (Institutes I.13.13)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust defense of the **Filioque** and his nuanced reception of the **ecumenical creeds** shaped the confessional identity of the Reformed tradition. His insistence on **Scripture as the final authority** influenced later Protestant approaches to creedal subscription and doctrinal formulation. Calvin’s Trinitarian theology continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between the **Son and the Spirit** and the role of the creeds in church life.
