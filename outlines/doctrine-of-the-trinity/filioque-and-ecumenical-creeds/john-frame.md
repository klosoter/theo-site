# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the **Filioque** and the **ecumenical creeds** from a distinctly Reformed and presuppositional perspective, emphasizing the authority of **Scripture** over tradition while recognizing the historical importance of the **Nicene** and **Apostles’ Creeds**. He affirms the **Filioque** as biblically warranted, yet urges charity in ecumenical dialogue, stressing the need for doctrinal clarity and fidelity to **Trinitarian orthodoxy**.

- "The filioque is not only permissible but required by the teaching of Scripture." ("The Doctrine of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- "Creeds and Confessions as Standards for Theology" in The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God (1987)
- "The Trinity" in Contemporary Worship Music: A Biblical Defense (1997)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord: An Introduction to Systematic Theology (2006)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Supreme Authority**
   - Upholds **sola Scriptura** as the ultimate norm for doctrine, including Trinitarian formulations.
   - Views creeds as valuable but always subordinate to biblical revelation.
   - Critiques any elevation of tradition above the clear teaching of Scripture.
   - Argues that the **Filioque** must be evaluated primarily by its scriptural basis.
   - "The ultimate standard for doctrine is the Word of God, not the traditions of men." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Affirmation of the Filioque**
   - Defends the **Filioque** as a legitimate and necessary implication of biblical texts.
   - Cites passages such as John 15:26 and Galatians 4:6 to support the procession of the Spirit from the Son.
   - Argues that the Western addition to the creed clarifies, rather than distorts, Trinitarian doctrine.
   - Maintains that the **Filioque** safeguards the full deity and unity of the Son and Spirit.
   - "The filioque clause is not an unwarranted addition, but a faithful summary of biblical teaching." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Respect for Ecumenical Creeds**
   - Acknowledges the historical and theological significance of the **ecumenical creeds**.
   - Sees the **Nicene Creed** as a foundational summary of orthodox Trinitarianism.
   - Encourages the use of creeds for catechesis and worship within the church.
   - Warns, however, against treating creeds as infallible or on par with Scripture.
   - "Creeds are helpful summaries, but they must always be tested by Scripture." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

4. **Charity in Ecumenical Dialogue**
   - Advocates for humility and patience in discussions with Eastern Orthodox and other traditions.
   - Recognizes the historical and linguistic complexities behind the **Filioque** controversy.
   - Urges Reformed Christians to seek unity in essential doctrines while acknowledging differences.
   - Stresses that true catholicity is grounded in biblical fidelity, not mere institutional unity.
   - "We should approach these debates with both conviction and charity." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Trinitarian Clarity and Orthodoxy**
   - Insists on the necessity of clear and precise **Trinitarian** formulations for the health of the church.
   - Warns against modalism, subordinationism, and other Trinitarian errors.
   - Sees the **Filioque** as a safeguard against diminishing the Son’s role in the Godhead.
   - Emphasizes the unity and coequality of the three persons of the Trinity.
   - "Orthodox Trinitarianism requires careful attention to both biblical language and historic formulations." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s robust defense of the **Filioque** and nuanced appreciation for the **ecumenical creeds** have shaped contemporary Reformed engagement with Trinitarian theology. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and his presuppositional method have influenced a generation of theologians to approach historical controversies with both conviction and humility. Frame’s work continues to foster dialogue between Reformed, evangelical, and broader Christian traditions, emphasizing both doctrinal fidelity and charitable engagement.
