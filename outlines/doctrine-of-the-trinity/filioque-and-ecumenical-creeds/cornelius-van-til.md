# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **Filioque** and the **ecumenical creeds** through the lens of his **Reformed apologetics** and commitment to the **self-attesting authority of Scripture**. He affirmed the doctrinal formulations of the early **ecumenical councils** as subordinate standards, emphasizing their value insofar as they faithfully express the **Trinitarian** and **Christological** truths of Scripture, including the Western affirmation of the **Filioque** clause. Van Til insisted that all creedal formulations must be evaluated by their fidelity to the **self-contained ontological Trinity** revealed in the Bible.

- "The creeds of the church are valuable only as they are in accord with the self-attesting Christ of Scripture." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Scriptural Revelation**
    - All doctrinal formulations, including the **Filioque** and creeds, must be judged by Scripture.
    - The authority of the **ecumenical creeds** is derivative, not ultimate.
    - Scripture alone provides the final standard for **Trinitarian** doctrine.
    - The church’s confessions serve as secondary guides subject to biblical correction.
    - "The Bible is itself the final and absolute criterion of truth." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Self-Contained Ontological Trinity**
    - The doctrine of the **Trinity** is foundational for all Christian theology.
    - The **Filioque** is affirmed as expressing the eternal relationship within the Godhead.
    - The unity and diversity within the Trinity ground all knowledge and reality.
    - Any creedal statement must uphold the ontological equality and distinction of the persons.
    - "The ontological Trinity is the presupposition of all predication." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Critical Reception of Tradition**
    - The **ecumenical creeds** are respected as historical expressions of faith.
    - Tradition is valuable but always subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
    - The church’s historical formulations are to be critically assessed in light of biblical teaching.
    - The **Filioque** is defended insofar as it aligns with the biblical witness to the Spirit’s procession.
    - "We must always test the creeds by the Word of God." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Antithesis and Apologetic Method**
    - The **antithesis** between Christian and non-Christian thought extends to doctrinal formulations.
    - The **Filioque** controversy highlights the need for a consistently biblical approach to doctrine.
    - Apologetics must defend the **Trinitarian** faith as revealed, not as constructed by tradition alone.
    - The unity of the church is grounded in shared submission to the authority of Scripture.
    - "There is no common ground except that which God himself has established." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Ecumenicity and Confessional Identity**
    - True **ecumenicity** is rooted in shared confession of biblical truth, not mere institutional unity.
    - The **ecumenical creeds** serve as a basis for unity only when they are faithful to Scripture.
    - The **Filioque** is a point of confessional identity for the Western church, expressing biblical teaching.
    - Unity must never come at the expense of doctrinal fidelity to the **Trinitarian** revelation.
    - "Unity in the church must be unity in the truth as God has revealed it." (Essays on Christian Education)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **Filioque** and the **ecumenical creeds** reinforced the Reformed emphasis on the **primacy of Scripture** over tradition. His insistence on the **self-attesting authority of the Triune God** shaped generations of Reformed theologians and apologists, particularly in their engagement with both Eastern Orthodoxy and broader ecumenical discussions. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to confessional standards that are always subject to the test of biblical fidelity. His work continues to influence debates on the relationship between creedal tradition and the living voice of Scripture.
