# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate the **Reformed tradition’s** commitment to the **ecumenical creeds** and the Western doctrine of the **Trinity**, including the **filioque**. These confessions uphold the procession of the **Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son**, grounding their teaching in both **Scripture** and the historic faith of the church.

- "We believe in one only God, who is one single essence, in which are three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct, according to their incommunicable properties; namely, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 8–11
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), Lord’s Day 8
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), Rejection of Errors, I.1
- The Book of Confessions (Reformed Church in America), containing the Three Forms
- Philip Schaff, The Creeds of Christendom (secondary reference for historical context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Ecumenical Creeds**
    - Explicitly endorse the **Apostles’ Creed**, **Nicene Creed**, and **Athanasian Creed** as faithful summaries of Christian doctrine.
    - Treat the creeds as subordinate standards, subject to **Scripture** but authoritative for church teaching.
    - Accept the Western form of the Nicene Creed, including the **filioque** clause.
    - Emphasize continuity with the ancient, universal church in matters of **Trinitarian confession**.
    "We willingly receive the three creeds, namely, that of the Apostles, of Nice, and of Athanasius." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

2. **Procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son**
    - Confess that the **Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from both the Father and the Son**.
    - Cite biblical texts (e.g., John 15:26, Galatians 4:6) to support this doctrine.
    - Align with the Western theological tradition on the **filioque**.
    - Reject any subordinationism or denial of the Son’s role in the Spirit’s procession.
    "The Holy Ghost is neither the Father nor the Son, but proceeds from both." (Belgic Confession, Art. 11)

3. **Scripture as the Norm for Creedal Formulation**
    - Insist that all creeds and confessions must be grounded in **Scripture alone**.
    - Use biblical exegesis to defend the doctrine of the **Trinity** and the **filioque**.
    - Acknowledge the creeds’ authority only insofar as they agree with the Word of God.
    - Encourage catechetical instruction based on both Scripture and the ecumenical creeds.
    "We believe all things contained in them [the creeds] so far as they agree with the Word of God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

4. **Unity and Distinction within the Trinity**
    - Emphasize the **unity of the divine essence** and the real, eternal distinction of the three persons.
    - Attribute personal properties: the Father unbegotten, the Son begotten, the Spirit proceeding.
    - Maintain that the Spirit’s procession from the Son does not compromise the Father’s monarchy.
    - Reject modalism and tritheism, upholding orthodox **Trinitarianism**.
    "There are in one only divine essence three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

5. **Ecumenical Intent and Reformed Identity**
    - Present the Reformed faith as catholic, not sectarian, by embracing the ancient creeds.
    - Use the creeds to demonstrate doctrinal agreement with the broader Christian tradition.
    - Defend the Reformation’s continuity with the early church, especially on the **Trinity**.
    - Employ the creeds as tools for catechesis, worship, and polemics against heresy.
    "We detest all heresies and sects which are repugnant to these articles." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have established the Reformed tradition as both **confessionally robust** and ecumenically rooted. Their affirmation of the **filioque** and the ecumenical creeds has fostered theological continuity with the Western church, while also distinguishing Reformed orthodoxy from both Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. These confessions continue to serve as foundational documents for Reformed churches worldwide, anchoring their doctrine of the Trinity in both **Scripture** and the historic creeds.
