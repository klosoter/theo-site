### TITLE
From the Father through the Son: Filioque, monarchy of the Father, and the authority of the ecumenical creeds

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: whether the Holy Spirit’s eternal procession is from the Father alone or from the Father and the Son, and how this claim relates to the authority and text of the ecumenical creeds under **divine simplicity**, **relations of origin**, and **monarchy of the Father**.
- Decisive figures: Augustine of Hippo, Gregory of Nazianzus, Maximus the Confessor, Photius of Constantinople, Anselm of Canterbury, Thomas Aquinas.
- Traditions: Cappadocian patristic trinitarianism, Latin Augustinian and medieval scholasticism, Byzantine theology, conciliar and creedal tradition in late antique and medieval church, Reformation reception.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Latin debates on one spirative principle and the Augustinian nexus amoris; Eastern debates on the scope of the Father’s monarchy and dia tou Huiou.
  - External: East–West conflicts over ekporeusis versus processio, the legitimacy of inserting Filioque into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, and the status of the Athanasian Creed.
  - Contemporary: ecumenical dialogues on per Filium, liturgical omission while maintaining doctrine, translation and conceptual clarity under **analogical knowledge**, and pneumatological concerns.
- Position: The Filioque, rightly construed as from the Father through the Son as from one principle under the Father’s **monarchy**, is biblically and theologically warranted, coherent with the creed’s faith, and may be taught normatively while using the original Greek text of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed for ecumenical use.

### ESSAY
The Filioque controversy is not a marginal semantic quarrel but a pressure test of classical trinitarianism at precisely the point where **divine simplicity**, **relations of origin**, and the **monarchy of the Father** converge. The question is whether the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father alone or from the Father and the Son, and, secondarily, whether the insertion of “and the Son” into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed is legitimate in the church’s common rule of faith. To answer in a manner defensible before examiners, one must move on three fronts simultaneously: a precise conceptual grammar of procession and mission anchored in Scripture, an historically accurate trajectory of East and West that neither caricatures nor collapses them, and a principled account of conciliar authority and creedal reception that distinguishes text from dogmatic content. I will argue that the Filioque is true if articulated as from the Father through the Son as from one principle under the Father’s monarchy, that Scripture warrants it when read within the classical doctrine of **inseparable operations**, and that while the Western insertion was procedurally irregular in ecumenical terms, its doctrinal intent was orthodox. Pastoral prudence today commends using the original Greek text in ecumenical worship while maintaining and teaching the Filioque as a necessary entailment of Nicene faith.

Augustine of Hippo stands at the decisive Latin starting point, not because he invented the Filioque, but because he gave the West its mature conceptual architecture. In De Trinitate Augustine reasons from Scripture under the assumption of **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations**. The missions reveal the processions. The Son is sent by the Father because he is eternally begotten from the Father. The Spirit is sent by the Father and the Son because he eternally proceeds from the Father and the Son. He binds this claim to exegesis: the Spirit is the Spirit of the Son in Galatians 4, the Spirit of Christ in Romans 8, and he receives from what is the Son’s in John 16. In John 15 the Spirit proceeds from the Father and is sent by the Son from the Father. Augustine’s interpretive axiom is that what the Spirit receives temporally in the mission manifests what he has eternally. Because the Son has all that he has from the Father, the Son’s conferral to the Spirit signifies an eternal communication that is not independent of the Father but is the Father’s own. Augustine tightens this with his account of the Spirit as the nexus amoris, the consubstantial Love of Father and Son. The Spirit is not another will or an impersonal bond, but a hypostasis whose personal property is to proceed from the Father and the Son. Augustine’s metaphysical restraint is essential. There is no composition in God. There are only **relations of origin** that are really distinct yet identical with the divine essence. The Father is unbegotten, the Son is begotten, and the Spirit proceeds. If the Spirit did not proceed from the Son, Augustine argues, the Son would be sterile with respect to the Spirit and the Spirit would be ontologically alien to the Son, undermining the unity of operation revealed in the sending of the Spirit by the risen Christ. Examined under pressure, Augustine’s position neither introduces two causes in God nor infringes the Father’s monarchy. The Son spirates not as an independent source but as receiving from the Father all that he is and has, including the power of spirating the Spirit. When examiners ask whether the Augustinian nexus makes the Spirit a mere relation between Father and Son, the reply is that in Augustine relation is a mode of subsistence for the persons, not a mere quality. The Spirit is person precisely as the relation of procession from Father and Son. Under **analogical knowledge**, we deny that this reduces the Spirit to an attribute while confessing that the names of origin truly indicate hypostatic identity.

Gregory of Nazianzus provides the necessary Eastern counterpoise, not as an antagonist but as the principal patristic architect of the **monarchy of the Father** and the Spirit’s distinct mode of origin. In the Theological Orations Gregory insists that the Spirit is not a creature, not a son, but proceeds from the Father. He stabilizes the classical grammar: the Father is the single cause and source of divinity, the Son is begotten from the Father, the Spirit proceeds from the Father, and both Son and Spirit share the one essence. Gregory also intuits, without full systematization, the dia tou Huiou line that will be crucial. The Spirit proceeds from the Father and is manifested and given through the Son. He guards the Father’s **monarchy** not as numerical superiority or authoritarian rule, but as the unique principium of the Godhead. Gregory’s refusal to multiply causes decisively shaped the Eastern worry that Filioque introduces two archai, one in the Father and one in the Son. When examiners press whether Gregory rules out any causal role of the Son with respect to the Spirit, one must answer that Gregory’s frequent through the Son language regarding the Spirit’s manifestation grounds a robust account of the Son’s mediatory role, but that he reserves the ekporeusis, the strict term for origination from a cause, for the Father alone. This lexicon, not the ontology, is often the point at issue.

Maximus the Confessor functions as a hinge figure who, long before the schism, read Latin claims in an Eastern key. In his letter to Marinus, Maximus clarifies that when Latins confess the Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son, they do not posit two causes or origins. They intend that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son. The Son is not an independent source but the one through whom the Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father. Maximus thus affirms the Filioque as equivalent to the Cappadocian dia tou Huiou while preserving the Father’s **monarchy**. This is not a diplomatic compromise but a conceptual mapping between Greek ekporeusis and Latin processio. Ekporeusis is a technical term for origin from a causal source. Processio is a broader Latin that can signify any coming forth. Maximus allows that the Spirit’s ekporeusis is from the Father alone while the Spirit’s processio is from the Father through the Son. When examiners challenge whether this is anachronistic harmonization, one can reply that Maximus writes from within Greek theological concerns yet explicitly defends the Latin formulation as orthodox on the ground that it denies two principles. This interpretive bridge will be developed later by Thomas Aquinas into the formula one spirative principle, the Father and the Son as one cause.

Photius of Constantinople must be treated in depth because he reframed the entire issue polemically and canonically for the East. In his Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit Photius accuses the West of introducing a doctrinal innovation that severs the unity of God’s cause, confuses hypostatic properties, and violates conciliar authority by altering the Nicene Creed. Photius presses both ontology and canon law. Ontologically, he argues, the Spirit’s ekporeusis from the Father alone is the firm line that guards the Father’s **monarchy**. To add the Son as source, whether principal or co-principal, effectively posits two causes and either collapses the Son into an intermediate cause or dissolves the Spirit’s distinct hypostasis. Canonically, he appeals to the prohibition at Ephesus against composing another creed and to the practice of the undivided church in reciting the creed without Filioque. A robust defense must not deflect these claims but address them head on. First, the ontological concern. The Latin response, articulated in different keys by Anselm and Thomas, is that there are not two principles but one spirative principle. The Father communicates the one divine essence to the Son by generation. Because in God essence and power are identical, the Father communicates to the Son the spirative power. The Father and Son spirate the Spirit as one principle since they are one God. The Father remains the font as principal cause because the Son spirates only by receiving this from the Father. Thus no second source is introduced. Photius’ insistence that any involvement of the Son introduces a second cause is therefore not inevitable if one grants the axiom of **divine simplicity** and the Son’s reception of all from the Father. Second, the canonical question. It is true that the West introduced the clause regionally at Toledo against Arianism and that it spread without ecumenical synodical ratification, only reaching Roman usage centuries later. Ephesus does prohibit composing another creed. Yet the West argued it did not compose another creed but explicated the same faith against contemporary errors, and that the clause’s doctrinal content was already confessed in the Quicunque vult known as the Athanasian Creed. A candid judgment is that the West acted without ecumenical procedure. This does not make the doctrine false, but it complicates the claim of a universally shared creedal text. An examiner might ask whether this admission concedes Photius’ case. The answer is no: it concedes a procedural irregularity while maintaining doctrinal orthodoxy. One can simultaneously hold that the original text of the Nicene Creed should be normative for ecumenical common prayer and that the Filioque is a true and necessary doctrinal explicitation, to be taught from Scripture and conciliar theology and confessed in Western symbols.

Anselm of Canterbury sharpened the Latin case by arguing that the Filioque is not only not contrary to faith but is rationally fitting and theologically necessary given the identity of persons by **relations of origin**. In De processione Spiritus Sancti Anselm insists that since the Son has all that the Father has except being Father, and since the Father spirates the Spirit, the Son too must spirate. Otherwise the Spirit would not be from the Son and the communion between Son and Spirit would be undermined. Anselm is not deducing the Trinity from reason but explicating how, once the persons are known, the implications under simplicity and consubstantiality follow. He also contends that if the Spirit does not proceed from the Son, then the Son is either not distinguished from the Spirit or there is some other relation by which they differ, which is impossible under the fixed triad of relations. The obvious objection is that Anselm collapses causality into nature, thereby imposing Latin categories onto Greek concerns. A proper defense is that Anselm’s causal language is already constrained by **analogical knowledge** and by the denial of composition. He is not multiplying causes but reasoning that the Father’s gift of essence to the Son includes the common power to spirate. Modern readers should resist the impulse to judge Anselm by a strict Greek lexicon of ekporeusis, since his aim is to show that the Son’s participation in spiration under the Father’s monarchy is necessary precisely to avoid binitarianism or a pneumatological isolation of the Spirit from the Son.

Thomas Aquinas consolidates the Latin synthesis with decisive precision. In Summa Theologiae I.36 and in Contra errores Graecorum, Thomas affirms that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as from one principle. The Father is the font because the Son receives the power of spirating from the Father. Thomas nails down three points that defuse Eastern objections at their strongest. First, he distinguishes cause as principle of person from origin as personal property. The Father alone is the principal without principle. The Son’s participation in spiration is not another principle but the sharing of the one principle. Second, he anchors theology in Scripture under **inseparable operations** and the missions. The Spirit is sent by the Son and receives from the Son. The temporal missions manifest eternal relations without collapsing them. The Spirit’s breathing in John 20 evokes Genesis 2 and signals a trinitarian pattern: the Father breathes by the Son in the Spirit. Third, Thomas extends Maximus’s per Filium to a metaphysical rule. Whatever is from the Father is through the Son. This rules out two principles while drawing together Greek and Latin idioms. An examiner may ask whether Thomas’ formula satisfies the Greek restriction of ekporeusis to the Father. The answer is that Thomas grants the Father’s **monarchy** and can happily say that the Spirit’s ekporeusis is from the Father, while the Spirit’s processio and eternal communication is through the Son. Thomas is no Latin supremacist. He labors to demonstrate genuine concord under one doctrinal content and two linguistic registers.

The matter is not confined to patristic and scholastic sources. It turns upon the ecumenical creeds. The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 confesses that the Spirit proceeds from the Father, using the Greek term ekporeuomenon. This text is shared and authoritative. The West’s later addition of Filioque arose amid Arian and adoptionist controversies, first at Toledo in 589 and then spread through Frankish lands, eventually entering Roman liturgy centuries later. Ephesus in 431 forbade composing another creed, and Chalcedon reaffirmed the authority of 381. The Athanasian Creed, likely later and Western, plainly confesses the Spirit from the Father and the Son. In the Reformation, Western churches, including the Reformed, received the Filioque as standard dogma. The Westminster Confession affirms that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. The ecumenical problem is that the East never received the addition and regarded it as both doctrinally dangerous and procedurally illicit. A sound Reformed approach respects the ecumenicity of the original text while taking responsibility for our own confessional commitments. We should say that the ecumenical creed properly so called does not contain the Filioque in its original Greek, and this text remains the common rule of faith. We should also say that our confessional standards, in line with Augustine, Anselm, and Thomas, teach the Filioque as doctrinally true. In ecumenical contexts, using the original text without the clause is wiser for unity, provided we teach clearly what we confess and why.

The decisive biblical warrants must be recalled under **analogical knowledge** and classical rules of predication. John 15 locates ekporeusis of the Spirit in the Father, and John 16 says the Spirit takes what is the Son’s. The Spirit is sent by the Son from the Father. John 20’s breathing by Christ evokes the Spirit’s origin through the Son. Paul’s language of the Spirit of the Son and the Spirit of Christ shows a relation of origin that is more than mere mission but revealed by mission. Under **inseparable operations**, the external works of the Trinity reflect internal order without division. The Spirit’s temporal reception from the Son reveals an eternal order wherein the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son. This biblical grammar is what the Filioque safeguards against social or functional constructions that detach the Spirit from Christological mediation. Examiners may push whether biblical language warrants eternal procession. The response is the classical one: missions reveal processions, not by univocal inference but by warranted theological reasoning preserved by the rule of faith.

With these materials, we can clarify the three debate layers. Internally within the Latin tradition, the central disagreements were over the mode of the Son’s role. Augustine’s nexus amoris risks making the Spirit a bond if mishandled, which later Latin thinkers corrected by specifying the Spirit’s hypostatic property as spirated love without collapse into a mere relation between Father and Son. Scholastic debate focused on whether the Father and Son are a single spirative principle. Thomas resolved this by insisting on one principle under simplicity and consubstantiality. In the East, internal discussion centered on the strength of dia tou Huiou. The Cappadocians use through the Son language liberally, and John of Damascus codifies the Spirit’s manifestation through the Son while reserving ekporeusis for the Father. Maximus endorses Latin per Filium if it denies two causes. Later Byzantine theology tends to harden the line, with anxiety that any role of the Son beyond manifestation trespasses upon ekporeusis. The internal upshot is that both traditions, when read at their best, possess resources to confess the Son’s mediatory role and the Father’s unique causality.

The external debate pits the West’s Filioque against the Byzantine accusation of innovation. The West must answer both doctrinal and canonical concerns. Doctrinally, the West claims no second cause but one principle. Canonically, it admits that the creed’s text was altered without ecumenical permission, even as it insists that the added words explicate the received faith. The Eastern critique must be met by careful verbal differentiations and by guiding ecumenical practice that respects the shared text while maintaining the doctrine. The Council of Florence attempted reunion by recognizing the legitimacy of both formulas, ex Patre per Filium and ex Patre Filioque, but the reunion failed. Modern dialogues, such as the 1995 Vatican clarification and North American Orthodox–Catholic consultations, have moved toward recognizing per Filium as a doctrinal equivalence, while recommending the creed’s recitation without the clause. The Reformed can and should affirm such moves without surrendering dogmatic substance.

Contemporary debates require clarity about language, mission, and liturgy. Translation differences between ekporeusis and processio have fueled suspicion. Teaching must explicitly distinguish strict origination from causal source in Greek from broader Latin procession and explain why per Filium secures the doctrinal common ground while keeping the Father’s **monarchy** intact. Pneumatological concerns arise that the Filioque marginalizes the Spirit. The answer is the opposite: it embeds the Spirit in the economy of the Son as the one who perfects the Son’s mission and unites believers to Christ. The Spirit’s personal property is not subordination but to be from the Father through the Son as consubstantial Love, which magnifies rather than diminishes his person. Another contemporary anxiety is social trinitarianism’s tendency to construe the relations as cooperative but independent agencies. The Filioque, anchored in **inseparable operations**, counters this by preserving the order of origin that grounds the unity of action. Liturgically, many Western churches now recite the creed without the Filioque in ecumenical services. This is pastorally commendable when paired with catechesis that explains the doctrine. The Athanasian Creed remains a Western symbol that unambiguously affirms the Filioque and can function as a didactic anchor.

One final set of objections must be anticipated. Does the Filioque imperil **divine simplicity** by implying that the Spirit’s origin depends on two really distinct relations? The answer is no, because the Father and Son share the single essence and spirative power. The action is one, and the distinction of persons lies solely in their relations of origin. The Son’s relation to the Father is filiation, the Spirit’s to Father and Son is procession. There is no composition in God’s essence, only relational opposition establishing hypostatic identity. Does per Filium collapse the Spirit into a function of Christology? No, because the Spirit’s eternal procession is not a temporal function but an eternal personal property. It grounds, rather than derives from, the Son’s mission. Does the West’s unilateral insertion destroy the creed’s ecumenical authority? It damaged the shared text, but the creed’s authority as a doctrinal rule remains intact, and the original text can be honored in common recitation without surrendering the Filioque’s truth. Can the Reformed adopt the recent Catholic posture of reciting without the clause? Yes, provided we teach what the clause affirms and confess it in our doctrinal standards. Does Scripture ever say the Spirit proceeds from the Son? It does not use that exact phrase but teaches that the Spirit is the Spirit of the Son, is sent by the Son, and receives from the Son. Under the classical link between mission and procession, this suffices.

The constructive position is therefore clear. The Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father through the Son as from one principle. The Father’s **monarchy** is preserved because he is the font and principal cause, and the Son spirates only by receiving all from the Father. The Filioque, thus construed, is a true doctrine secured by Augustine’s insistence on **inseparable operations** and relations of origin, defended with Anselm’s rational fittingness, clarified with Thomas’s one principle, and reconcilable with Cappadocian dia tou Huiou as seen through Maximus’s bridge. Photius’s canonical protest rightly recalls the church to the discipline of common confession. Today, we should teach the Filioque as part of the West’s faithful reception of Nicene trinitarianism while reciting the original form of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed in ecumenical worship, trusting that **analogical knowledge** and careful catechesis can heal lingering conceptual misunderstandings. This position maintains doctrinal coherence across loci, embeds pneumatology in Christology without subordination, and honors creedal authority without absolutizing textual accretions.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Filioque affirms the Spirit’s eternal procession from the Father and the Son as from one principle, best expressed as from the Father through the Son under the Father’s **monarchy**, consistent with **divine simplicity** and **relations of origin**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: De Trinitate; missions reveal processions; Spirit as nexus amoris; from Father and Son under one principle.
  - Gregory of Nazianzus: establishes **monarchy of the Father** and reserves ekporeusis to the Father; emphasizes through the Son for manifestation.
  - Maximus the Confessor: per Filium bridge; Latin Filioque orthodox if it denies two causes.
  - Photius: Mystagogy; charges innovation and violation of creed; defends ekporeusis from the Father alone.
  - Anselm: De processione; rational fittingness of Filioque; guards personal distinctions by relations of origin.
  - Thomas Aquinas: one spirative principle; Father as font; scriptural grounding under **inseparable operations**.

  - Contemporary: ecumenical recognition of per Filium, liturgical omission with doctrinal maintenance, translation of ekporeusis versus processio, pneumatological integrity.
- Defended position: The Filioque is true when stated as from the Father through the Son as from one principle; retain and teach its doctrine, and use the original creed text without the clause in ecumenical worship for the sake of unity.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does Filioque violate simplicity by positing two causes? No, Father and Son spirate as one principle, with the Father as font.
  - Is per Filium enough for the East? It aligns with Cappadocian intent and Maximus, while keeping ekporeusis to the Father.
  - Did the West violate Ephesus? Procedurally irregular, yes; doctrinally orthodox explicitation, not a new creed.
  - Biblical basis for procession from the Son? Missions reveal processions via John 15–16, John 20, Galatians 4, Romans 8.
  - Does Filioque subordinate the Spirit? No, it secures his consubstantial origin and mission within **inseparable operations**.
