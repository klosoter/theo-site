# John Zizioulas (1931–2023)

John Zizioulas is a leading Orthodox theologian whose engagement with the **Filioque** controversy and the **ecumenical creeds** centers on the primacy of the **Father** as the sole source (monarchia) within the **Trinitarian** relations. He critiques the Western addition of the Filioque to the **Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed**, arguing that it disrupts the balance of **Trinitarian theology** and undermines the relational ontology foundational to Orthodox ecclesiology. Zizioulas advocates for a return to the original creedal formulations as a basis for genuine **ecumenical dialogue**.

- "The addition of the Filioque to the Creed is not a mere semantic issue but touches the very heart of the doctrine of the Trinity." ("Being as Communion")

## Key Works

- Being as Communion: Studies in Personhood and the Church
- Communion and Otherness: Further Studies in Personhood and the Church
- "The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity: The Significance of the Cappadocian Contribution" (in Trinitarian Theology Today)
- "The Filioque: Dogma, Theological Issue, or Church-dividing Difference?" (in The Forgotten Trinity)
- Lectures and essays in Ecumenical Dialogue (various collections)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Monarchia of the Father**
    - The **Father** is the sole source and principle (arche) of the **Trinity**.
    - The **Son** and **Spirit** both originate from the Father, but not from each other.
    - The Filioque compromises the unique role of the Father as the fountainhead of divinity.
    - This commitment is rooted in the **Cappadocian Fathers** and the original **ecumenical creeds**.
    - "The Father is the cause of the Son and the Spirit, and this is the basis of unity in the Trinity." (Being as Communion)

2. **Critique of the Filioque**
    - The Filioque addition is seen as a unilateral alteration of the **Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed**.
    - It introduces a double procession, which distorts the relational balance within the Trinity.
    - The Filioque reflects a Western theological development not shared by the undivided Church.
    - Zizioulas argues it leads to ecclesiological and pneumatological consequences.
    - "The Filioque is not simply a matter of words but of the very structure of Trinitarian theology." (Communion and Otherness)

3. **Relational Ontology of the Trinity**
    - Personhood and relationality are foundational to understanding the Trinity.
    - The unity of the Trinity is grounded in the person of the Father, not in a shared substance.
    - The Filioque risks reducing the Spirit to a derivative of the Son, undermining true relationality.
    - This ontology shapes both Trinitarian doctrine and ecclesiology.
    - "Being is communion: the being of God is relational, and this is safeguarded by the monarchy of the Father." (Being as Communion)

4. **Authority of Ecumenical Creeds**
    - The original text of the **ecumenical creeds** is normative for the universal Church.
    - Alterations like the Filioque threaten the unity and catholicity of Christian confession.
    - Zizioulas insists on fidelity to the creeds as received by the undivided Church.
    - The creeds are a basis for **ecumenical reconciliation** and dialogue.
    - "The Creed must remain as it was received by the whole Church, for it is the expression of our common faith." (The Filioque: Dogma, Theological Issue, or Church-dividing Difference?)

5. **Ecumenical Dialogue and Reconciliation**
    - Genuine ecumenical progress requires addressing the Filioque as a church-dividing issue.
    - Zizioulas calls for mutual understanding and respect for the theological traditions of East and West.
    - He advocates for a return to the original creed as a step toward unity.
    - Dialogue must be rooted in a shared commitment to the **Trinitarian faith** of the early Church.
    - "True unity can only be achieved when we return to the faith of the undivided Church." (Communion and Otherness)

## Legacy and Impact

Zizioulas has profoundly shaped contemporary Orthodox engagement with the **Filioque** and the authority of the **ecumenical creeds**, emphasizing the relational ontology of the Trinity and the monarchia of the Father. His work has influenced both Orthodox and ecumenical theology, fostering dialogue between East and West on divisive doctrinal issues. By grounding ecclesiology and Trinitarian doctrine in the patristic tradition, Zizioulas has become a central figure in modern discussions of Christian unity and the theological foundations of the Church.
