# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas offered a robust defense of the **Filioque** clause, grounding it in his doctrine of the **Trinity** and the **procession of the Holy Spirit**. He argued that the **ecumenical creeds**—especially the **Nicene Creed**—could legitimately include the Filioque, provided it was understood in line with orthodox **Trinitarian theology** and the unity of the divine essence.

- "The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, not as from another principle, but as from one principle with the Father." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.4)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, I, Questions 36–38
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 24–26
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book I, Distinction 11
- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Commentary on the Creed (Expositio super Symbolum Apostolorum)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son**
    - The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as the principal origin and from the Son as a co-principle.
    - The Filioque does not introduce two principles but affirms the unity of the divine essence.
    - Scriptural exegesis (e.g., John 15:26) supports the Spirit’s procession from both.
    - The Son’s role in the procession is rooted in the eternal generation within the Trinity.
    - "The Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Spirit." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.4)

2. **Legitimacy of the Filioque in the Ecumenical Creeds**
    - The Western Church’s addition of the Filioque is justified by theological necessity.
    - The creed’s authority is not diminished by clarifying doctrinal truths.
    - The Filioque expresses what is implicit in the original creed.
    - The unity of faith is preserved when the Filioque is properly understood.
    - "The addition of 'and the Son' does not destroy the unity of the faith." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.2 ad 2)

3. **Distinction of Persons and Unity of Essence**
    - The divine persons are distinguished by relations of origin, not by essence.
    - The Spirit’s procession from the Father and the Son does not divide the Godhead.
    - The Filioque upholds the consubstantiality of the Trinity.
    - The relations of origin are real distinctions within the one divine essence.
    - "The distinction of the divine persons is by the relations of origin alone." (Summa Theologiae I, q.28, a.3)

4. **Scriptural and Patristic Foundations**
    - Aquinas appeals to both Scripture and the Latin Fathers (especially Augustine) for the Filioque.
    - He interprets biblical texts as supporting the double procession.
    - Patristic consensus is seen as compatible with the Western formulation.
    - The Filioque is not a novelty but a faithful development of tradition.
    - "Augustine says, 'The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.'" (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.2)

5. **Ecumenical Sensitivity and Theological Clarification**
    - Aquinas recognizes the Eastern objections but seeks to clarify misunderstandings.
    - He distinguishes between the mode of expression and the substance of doctrine.
    - The Filioque is not meant to exclude the Father’s monarchy.
    - Theological dialogue should aim at unity in truth, not mere verbal agreement.
    - "The Greeks and Latins do not differ as to the substance of this article, but only as to the mode of expression." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.2 ad 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s articulation of the **Filioque** became foundational for later Western theology and was influential in shaping the Roman Catholic Church’s stance on the procession of the Holy Spirit. His careful engagement with both **Scripture** and the **ecumenical creeds** provided a framework for dialogue with Eastern Christianity, even as divisions persisted. Aquinas’s synthesis of patristic sources and scholastic reasoning continues to inform contemporary discussions on Trinitarian doctrine and ecumenical relations.
