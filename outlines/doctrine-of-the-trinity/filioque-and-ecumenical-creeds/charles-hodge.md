# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Reformed theology**, staunchly defended the **Nicene Creed** and the **Western addition of the Filioque** to the **ecumenical creeds**. He argued that the procession of the **Holy Spirit** from both the **Father and the Son** is biblically warranted and theologically necessary for maintaining the full deity of Christ and the unity of the Godhead.

- "The doctrine that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son is the doctrine of the Latin Church, of the Reformed Churches, and of the great majority of the theologians of the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially chapters on the Trinity)
- The Way of Life
- Commentary on the Confession of Faith
- Princeton Review articles on the Trinity and creeds

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Filioque as Biblically Grounded**
    - Hodge insists that the **Filioque** clause is rooted in **Scripture**, particularly in passages where the Spirit is described as the Spirit of Christ.
    - He argues that the **New Testament** presents the Spirit as sent by both the Father and the Son.
    - The **Filioque** safeguards the **co-equality** and **co-eternity** of the Son with the Father.
    - He maintains that omitting the Filioque risks subordinating the Son within the Trinity.
    - "The doctrine is not a mere speculative point, but one of vital importance." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Authority of Ecumenical Creeds**
    - Hodge affirms the **ecumenical creeds** (Apostles’, Nicene, Athanasian) as faithful summaries of biblical doctrine.
    - He views creeds as subordinate to Scripture but authoritative for church teaching.
    - The **Nicene Creed**, with the Filioque, expresses the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity.
    - He supports the historical development of creeds as guided by the Holy Spirit.
    - "Creeds are necessary as the means of preserving and propagating the faith." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Rejection of Eastern Orthodox Objections**
    - Hodge critiques the Eastern Orthodox rejection of the Filioque as based on a misunderstanding of biblical teaching.
    - He contends that the Eastern position undermines the unity of the Godhead.
    - The Western addition is not an unauthorized innovation but a legitimate doctrinal clarification.
    - He sees the controversy as rooted more in ecclesiastical politics than in theology.
    - "The opposition of the Greek Church to the Filioque is to be deplored, as it has led to unnecessary division." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Trinitarian Relations and Processions**
    - Hodge emphasizes the **personal properties** within the Trinity: generation, procession, and spiration.
    - The Spirit’s procession from the Father and the Son maintains the distinction of persons without division.
    - He upholds the **unity of essence** and **distinction of persons** as essential to orthodox Trinitarianism.
    - The Filioque clarifies the relationship between the Son and the Spirit.
    - "The Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as from one source." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Confessional and Ecclesiastical Unity**
    - Hodge believes the Filioque is essential for **confessional integrity** in the Reformed tradition.
    - He regards agreement on the ecumenical creeds as foundational for visible church unity.
    - The Filioque serves as a doctrinal boundary against heterodox views of the Trinity.
    - He encourages ecumenical dialogue grounded in shared creedal commitments.
    - "Unity in the faith is to be sought in unity in the truth." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **Filioque** and the authority of the **ecumenical creeds** shaped the doctrinal identity of American Presbyterianism and the broader Reformed tradition. His systematic articulation of Trinitarian doctrine remains influential in contemporary discussions on the Trinity and East-West relations. Hodge’s commitment to creedal orthodoxy continues to inform debates on confessional subscription and the theological boundaries of the church.
