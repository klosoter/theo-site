# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches the **Filioque** and the **ecumenical creeds** from a Reformed and **biblically grounded** perspective, emphasizing the authority of **Scripture** over tradition while recognizing the value of historic formulations. He affirms the **Trinitarian** consensus of the early creeds, yet insists that all doctrinal articulations, including the Filioque clause, must be tested by the **biblical witness**. Poythress is attentive to the theological and ecumenical implications of the Filioque, seeking clarity and unity rooted in **divine revelation**.

- "The authority of creeds is always subordinate to the authority of Scripture, which alone is infallible." (Inerrancy and Worldview)

## Key Works

- Inerrancy and Worldview (2012)
- The Mystery of the Trinity (2020)
- Symphonic Theology (1987)
- "Modern Theology and the Filioque" (Westminster Theological Journal, 2003)
- "Creeds and Confessions: Their Place in the Church" (online essay)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Supreme Authority**
    - All doctrinal formulations, including the Filioque, must be tested by **Scripture**.
    - Ecumenical creeds are valuable but not infallible.
    - The **Trinity** is to be understood primarily through biblical revelation.
    - Tradition is helpful but always subordinate to the Word of God.
    - "Scripture alone is the final authority for faith and practice." (Inerrancy and Worldview)

2. **Affirmation of Nicene Trinitarianism**
    - The **Nicene Creed** and its Trinitarian structure are foundational for orthodox faith.
    - The unity and distinction of the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** are essential.
    - The Filioque must not undermine the personal distinctions within the Trinity.
    - The creeds serve as guardrails against heresy but must be interpreted biblically.
    - "The creeds summarize biblical teaching, but they do not replace it." (Symphonic Theology)

3. **Cautious Reception of the Filioque**
    - The Filioque expresses a legitimate concern for the Son’s role in the Spirit’s procession.
    - Biblical support for the Filioque is nuanced and requires careful exegesis.
    - The addition of the Filioque to the creed should be approached with humility and charity.
    - Theological formulations must avoid both subordinationism and modalism.
    - "We must be careful not to let theological formulas outrun the teaching of Scripture." (The Mystery of the Trinity)

4. **Value of Ecumenical Creeds**
    - The **ecumenical creeds** provide a shared doctrinal foundation for the universal church.
    - They foster unity and continuity with the historic Christian faith.
    - Their authority is derivative, not absolute.
    - They must be continually re-examined in light of Scripture.
    - "Creeds are helpful summaries, but their usefulness depends on their fidelity to Scripture." (Creeds and Confessions: Their Place in the Church)

5. **Pursuit of Ecumenical Unity**
    - Theological differences over the Filioque should not obscure the deeper unity in Christ.
    - Dialogue between East and West is encouraged for mutual understanding.
    - The church should seek unity without compromising biblical truth.
    - Ecumenical engagement must be rooted in shared commitment to the gospel.
    - "True unity is found in Christ and his Word, not in uniformity of tradition." (Symphonic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vern Poythress has contributed to contemporary discussions on the **Trinity** and the authority of the **ecumenical creeds** by insisting on the primacy of Scripture and the necessity of doctrinal humility. His work encourages Reformed theologians to engage with historic creeds and the Filioque debate in a way that is both biblically faithful and ecumenically sensitive. Poythress’s approach fosters a spirit of unity grounded in the gospel, while maintaining clear theological boundaries. His influence is evident in ongoing evangelical reflection on the relationship between tradition and Scripture.
