# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **Filioque** and **ecumenical creeds** through the lens of his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He regarded traditional dogmatic formulations, including Trinitarian debates, as expressions of early Christian experience rather than binding metaphysical truths, emphasizing the **kerygma** over doctrinal precision. For Bultmann, the significance of creeds lies in their existential meaning for faith rather than their ontological claims.

- "The real question is not the metaphysical structure of the Trinity, but what the message of the New Testament means for existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Primitive Christianity in its Contemporary Setting" (1956)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Credo: Historical and Theological Guide to the Apostles' Creed" (secondary, ed. by Gerhard Ebeling)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Creeds**
    - Creeds, including those addressing the **Filioque**, are mythological expressions shaped by their historical context.
    - The existential meaning behind creedal statements is more important than their literal or metaphysical content.
    - The language of the **ecumenical creeds** must be reinterpreted for modern existential understanding.
    - Theological disputes (e.g., Filioque) reflect ancient worldviews, not binding truths for contemporary faith.
    - "It is not the mythological world picture but the existential decision that matters." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ (kerygma) is central, not the precise formulations of Trinitarian doctrine.
    - The **Filioque** controversy is secondary to the existential encounter with the risen Christ.
    - Faith is grounded in the event of proclamation, not in assent to creedal metaphysics.
    - The creeds serve as witnesses to faith, not as final authorities.
    - "Faith does not rest on doctrine but on the encounter with the word." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Doctrine**
    - Doctrinal statements must be interpreted in terms of their existential significance for the believer.
    - The **Trinity** and **Filioque** are to be understood as symbolic of the believer's relationship with God.
    - The creeds point to the reality of divine action in human existence, not to metaphysical structures.
    - Theological language is meaningful only insofar as it addresses human existence.
    - "The question is what these statements mean for existence here and now." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Historical Relativity of Dogma**
    - All dogmatic formulations, including the **Filioque**, are historically conditioned.
    - The development of the creeds reflects the church's response to its context, not timeless revelation.
    - The authority of the creeds is relative to their ability to communicate the gospel existentially.
    - Theological disputes must be critically examined in light of historical context.
    - "Dogma is always the product of its time and must be reinterpreted for each new age." (Primitive Christianity in its Contemporary Setting)

5. **Critical Engagement with Tradition**
    - Tradition, including the **ecumenical creeds**, must be engaged critically, not uncritically received.
    - The church must continually reinterpret its confessions in light of the contemporary situation.
    - The **Filioque** issue exemplifies the need for ongoing theological reflection rather than static acceptance.
    - The goal is authentic faith, not mere repetition of inherited formulas.
    - "Tradition must be judged by its power to speak to the present." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **Filioque** and **ecumenical creeds** has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the areas of **hermeneutics** and existential interpretation. His insistence on the existential meaning of doctrine challenged both Protestant and Catholic traditions to reconsider the function of creeds in the life of faith. While often criticized for relativizing dogma, Bultmann’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to articulate Christian faith in a modern context. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relevance and interpretation of the church’s confessional heritage.
