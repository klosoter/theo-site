# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **ecumenical creeds** and accepted the **Filioque** clause as a legitimate expression of the **Western Church’s doctrine of the Trinity**. While he did not engage in extensive polemics over the Filioque, Luther maintained the **Nicene Creed** (with Filioque) in his liturgical reforms and upheld the **Trinitarian orthodoxy** of the early councils. For Luther, fidelity to the **Apostolic faith** as summarized in the creeds was essential for the unity and identity of the church.

- "We believe, teach, and confess that the only rule and norm according to which all doctrines and teachers alike must be appraised and judged are the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures of the Old and New Testament alone, as it is written... and also the three creeds, namely, the Apostles’, the Nicene, and the Athanasian." (Book of Concord, Epitome, Rule and Norm)

## Key Works

- The Large Catechism (especially the section on the Creed)
- The Small Catechism
- The Smalcald Articles
- Commentary on Galatians
- Luther’s liturgical writings (e.g., Formula Missae, Deutsche Messe)
- The Book of Concord (contains Luther’s confessional documents)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Ecumenical Creeds**
    - Luther upheld the **Apostles’**, **Nicene**, and **Athanasian Creeds** as faithful summaries of biblical doctrine.
    - He retained the creeds in both catechetical instruction and public worship.
    - The creeds were seen as binding for all Christians and essential for church unity.
    - Luther viewed the creeds as subordinate to, but faithful expositions of, **Scripture**.
    - "The Creed is a compendium and confession of the faith of all Christendom." (Large Catechism)

2. **Acceptance of the Filioque**
    - Luther accepted the **Filioque** as a legitimate Western development of the Nicene Creed.
    - He did not see the Filioque as a corruption but as a faithful expression of the **Trinitarian procession**.
    - The Filioque was retained in Lutheran liturgy and confessional documents.
    - Luther did not engage in controversy with the Eastern Church over this clause.
    - "We believe in the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and the Son." (Small Catechism)

3. **Scripture as the Supreme Norm**
    - The creeds are authoritative only insofar as they agree with **Scripture**.
    - Luther insisted that all doctrine, including Trinitarian formulations, must be grounded in the biblical witness.
    - He saw the creeds as reliable guides because they faithfully summarize scriptural teaching.
    - The authority of the creeds is derivative, not independent.
    - "The Word of God shall establish articles of faith and no one else, not even an angel." (Smalcald Articles)

4. **Trinitarian Orthodoxy**
    - Luther was committed to the **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** definitions of the Trinity and Christology.
    - He rejected both modalism and subordinationism, affirming the full divinity of the Son and Spirit.
    - The Filioque was understood as safeguarding the equality and unity of the divine persons.
    - Trinitarian doctrine was central to Luther’s theology of salvation and worship.
    - "We must believe in one God, who is three distinct persons and yet one God." (Large Catechism)

5. **Catechesis and Liturgy**
    - Luther integrated the ecumenical creeds into the core of Christian instruction.
    - The creeds were recited in worship and taught to all believers, including children.
    - He saw the creeds as essential for grounding Christians in the faith and guarding against heresy.
    - The Filioque was included in the liturgical recitation of the Nicene Creed.
    - "This is the faith which we teach to our children, and which we confess before the world." (Small Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s affirmation of the **ecumenical creeds** and acceptance of the **Filioque** shaped the doctrinal identity of Lutheranism and influenced broader Protestant confessional standards. By retaining the creeds in catechesis and worship, he ensured continuity with the historic church while grounding all doctrine in **Scripture**. Luther’s approach provided a model for balancing confessional tradition with biblical authority, and his stance on the Filioque contributed to ongoing Western consensus on the doctrine of the Trinity.
