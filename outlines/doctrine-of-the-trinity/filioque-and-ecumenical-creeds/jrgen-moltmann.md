# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches the **Filioque** and **ecumenical creeds** from his distinctive **Trinitarian theology**, emphasizing the importance of relationality within the **Trinity** and the need for genuine **East-West Christian unity**. He critiques the Western addition of the Filioque to the **Nicene Creed**, arguing that it distorts the balance of the **Trinitarian persons** and impedes ecumenical progress.

- "The Filioque clause has become the main dogmatic issue dividing the Eastern and Western churches, and it is a theological mistake to maintain it." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Key Works

- The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God
- Experiences in Theology: Ways and Forms of Christian Theology
- History and the Triune God: Contributions to Trinitarian Theology
- "The Reconciling Power of the Trinity" (in Theological Studies)
- God in Creation (relevant sections)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Relationality over Subordination**
    - Emphasizes the **perichoretic** (mutual indwelling) relationships among Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - Rejects any formulation that subordinates the **Spirit** to the Son and Father.
    - Argues that the Filioque risks introducing hierarchy into the **Trinity**.
    - Advocates for a model where all three persons are equally originative.
    - "The Western tradition’s Filioque clause has led to a subordination of the Spirit." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

2. **Ecumenical Priority and Creedal Integrity**
    - Stresses the importance of returning to the original **Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed**.
    - Views unilateral Western changes as a barrier to **Christian unity**.
    - Calls for mutual recognition and dialogue between East and West.
    - Sees the **creeds** as foundational for ecumenical theology.
    - "The original creed should be the basis for all Christian churches." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

3. **Pneumatological Emphasis**
    - Argues for the full **divinity and personhood of the Holy Spirit**.
    - Critiques the Western tradition for marginalizing the **Spirit**.
    - Sees the Spirit as the bond of love and communion within the **Trinity**.
    - Proposes a renewed **pneumatology** for contemporary theology.
    - "The Holy Spirit is not merely the bond between Father and Son, but a person in his own right." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **Historical-Critical Approach to Creeds**
    - Analyzes the historical context of the Filioque’s insertion.
    - Highlights the political and ecclesiastical motivations behind the change.
    - Encourages critical engagement with **tradition** rather than uncritical acceptance.
    - Sees **creeds** as living documents open to reform.
    - "We must not absolutize historical formulations, but seek their living truth." (Experiences in Theology)

5. **The Trinity as the Basis for Christian Community**
    - Connects **Trinitarian doctrine** to the life of the church.
    - Argues that the church should mirror the **communion** of the Trinity.
    - Sees the Filioque controversy as symptomatic of deeper ecclesial divisions.
    - Calls for a Trinitarian basis for reconciliation and **unity**.
    - "The church must become a reflection of the triune God’s community." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s critique of the **Filioque** and his advocacy for the original **ecumenical creeds** have significantly shaped modern **Trinitarian theology** and the ecumenical movement. His work has fostered renewed dialogue between Eastern and Western churches and influenced contemporary understandings of **pneumatology**. By emphasizing relationality and unity within the Trinity, Moltmann has provided a theological foundation for ongoing efforts toward Christian reconciliation.
