# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **Filioque** controversy and the **ecumenical creeds** from the standpoint of **dialectical theology** and a strong emphasis on **personal revelation**. He critiqued the Western addition of the Filioque to the **Nicene Creed**, arguing that it reflected deeper issues in the Western understanding of the **Trinity** and the relationship between **revelation** and **dogma**. Brunner sought a return to the original ecumenical formulations, emphasizing the importance of **biblical witness** over later doctrinal developments.

- "The Filioque is not merely a theological technicality, but a symptom of the Western Church’s tendency to subordinate the mystery of the Trinity to rational systematization." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God: Dogmatics, Volume I
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Dogmatics, Volume I: The Christian Doctrine of God
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Divine-Human Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Biblical Revelation**
    - Brunner insisted that **doctrinal formulations** must be grounded in the **biblical witness** rather than speculative philosophy.
    - He viewed the original **Nicene Creed** as more faithful to Scripture than later Western modifications.
    - The Filioque was seen as an example of dogma outpacing revelation.
    - He emphasized the necessity of returning to the **biblical roots** of Trinitarian doctrine.
    - "The Church must always test its creeds by the Word of God." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Critique of the Filioque Addition**
    - Brunner argued that the Filioque reflects a Western tendency toward **rationalism** in theology.
    - He believed the unilateral addition undermined the **ecumenical character** of the creeds.
    - The Filioque was seen as distorting the **Trinitarian relations** by subordinating the Spirit.
    - He called for ecumenical humility and dialogue regarding the creed’s original form.
    - "The Filioque is a Western innovation which has no place in the original creed of the undivided Church." (Dogmatics I)

3. **Personal Encounter with God**
    - Brunner stressed that **revelation** is a personal encounter, not merely assent to doctrinal formulas.
    - He warned against reducing the **Trinity** to abstract metaphysical speculation.
    - The creeds should serve as guides to encounter the living God, not as ends in themselves.
    - He valued the **ecumenical creeds** as witnesses to faith, not as exhaustive definitions.
    - "The creeds are signposts, not substitutes, for the encounter with the living God." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

4. **Ecumenical Unity and the Creeds**
    - Brunner advocated for the **unity of the Church** around the original ecumenical creeds.
    - He saw the Filioque as a barrier to reconciliation between East and West.
    - The creeds should be a basis for dialogue, not division.
    - He urged humility in doctrinal disputes for the sake of **Christian unity**.
    - "The Church must seek unity not by imposing additions, but by returning to the common confession of faith." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

5. **Rejection of Doctrinal Legalism**
    - Brunner critiqued the tendency to absolutize doctrinal formulations, including the Filioque.
    - He emphasized the **dynamic and living character** of Christian faith.
    - Theological language must remain open to correction by **Scripture** and the Spirit.
    - He warned against making creeds into legalistic barriers to fellowship.
    - "Dogma must never become a prison for the living faith of the Church." (Revelation and Reason)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s engagement with the **Filioque** and the **ecumenical creeds** contributed to renewed Protestant reflection on the importance of the original creedal formulations and the dangers of doctrinal innovation. His emphasis on **biblical revelation** and the personal encounter with God challenged both Western rationalism and confessional rigidity. Brunner’s work continues to influence ecumenical dialogue, especially regarding the **Trinity** and the quest for Christian unity. His legacy endures in ongoing conversations about the relationship between **Scripture**, tradition, and doctrinal development.
