# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, robustly defended the **Filioque** clause as both biblically warranted and theologically necessary for a proper doctrine of the **Trinity**. He affirmed the authority of the **ecumenical creeds**, especially the **Nicene Creed**, while arguing that the Western addition of "and the Son" was consistent with orthodox **Trinitarian theology** and did not constitute a corruption of the faith.

- "The procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son as well as from the Father is so clearly taught in Scripture that it cannot be denied without injury to the truth." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 3.31.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Third Topic, Questions 30–31)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected writings in Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (ed. Richard Muller)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary, ed. John Beardslee, selections on Trinity and creeds)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Filioque is Scripturally Grounded**
    - Argues that the **Holy Spirit** proceeds from both the **Father and the Son** based on passages like John 15:26 and Galatians 4:6.
    - Maintains that the **Filioque** expresses the biblical relationship within the **Trinity**.
    - Insists that denying the Filioque undermines the full deity and consubstantiality of the Son.
    - Uses patristic sources to support the Western tradition’s interpretation.
    - "The Son is not excluded from the spiration of the Spirit, but is expressly included." (Institutes, 3.31.2)

2. **Ecumenical Creeds are Authoritative but Reformable**
    - Upholds the **ecumenical creeds** (Apostles’, Nicene, Athanasian) as faithful summaries of biblical doctrine.
    - Argues that creeds are subordinate to **Scripture** and may be clarified or corrected if shown to be unscriptural.
    - Defends the Western Church’s right to clarify the Nicene Creed with the Filioque.
    - Emphasizes the unity of the church in confessing the core doctrines of the Trinity.
    - "We do not hold the creeds as infallible, but as true insofar as they agree with the Word of God." (Institutes, 1.2.17)

3. **Procession Distinct from Generation**
    - Distinguishes between the **eternal generation** of the Son and the **spiration** of the Spirit.
    - Asserts that the Spirit’s procession from the Son does not confuse the personal properties of the Trinity.
    - Maintains that this distinction preserves the unity and order within the Godhead.
    - Rejects both Sabellianism and subordinationism in Trinitarian relations.
    - "The procession of the Spirit is not the same as the generation of the Son, but is a distinct mode of subsistence." (Institutes, 3.31.4)

4. **Patristic Consensus Supports Filioque**
    - Cites **Augustine** and other Latin Fathers as witnesses to the double procession.
    - Argues that the Eastern Fathers do not contradict the Filioque when properly interpreted.
    - Uses the history of the creeds to show the Western tradition’s continuity with early Christianity.
    - Responds to Eastern objections by appealing to the development of doctrine.
    - "The Latin Fathers, especially Augustine, clearly teach the procession from the Son." (Institutes, 3.31.7)

5. **Filioque Preserves Trinitarian Orthodoxy**
    - Claims that the Filioque safeguards the **co-equality** and **consubstantiality** of the Son with the Father.
    - Warns that rejecting the Filioque risks subordinating the Son or dividing the Godhead.
    - Sees the clause as essential for a robust doctrine of the **Trinity**.
    - Affirms that the Western Church’s confession is not a novelty but a necessary clarification.
    - "The Filioque is not an addition, but an explanation necessary for the defense of the faith." (Institutes, 3.31.10)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s defense of the **Filioque** and his nuanced approach to the **ecumenical creeds** have shaped Reformed confessional identity and Trinitarian theology. His careful distinction between the authority of Scripture and the subordinate authority of creeds influenced later Protestant approaches to doctrinal formulation. Turretin’s arguments remain a standard reference in discussions of the Western and Eastern theological divide, and his work continues to inform contemporary Reformed engagement with the doctrine of the Trinity.
