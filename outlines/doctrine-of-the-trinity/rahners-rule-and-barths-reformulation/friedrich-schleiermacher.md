# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher is foundational for modern **Trinitarian theology** and the development of the so-called **Rahner’s Rule** (“the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa”). Schleiermacher’s approach to the **Trinity** is marked by a strong emphasis on the **immanence of God** and the primacy of **religious experience**, which led him to subordinate traditional Trinitarian distinctions to the unity of the divine consciousness as experienced in the Christian community.

- "The doctrine of the Trinity, taken literally, has no immediate bearing on religious experience." (The Christian Faith, §170)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - Theology must be grounded in the **feeling of absolute dependence**.
    - Doctrines are secondary expressions of the church’s communal experience.
    - The Trinity is not a speculative doctrine but a reflection of Christian self-consciousness.
    - The immanent and economic Trinity are not sharply distinguished in experience.
    - "All doctrines must be derived from the religious self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §19)

2. **Unity over Distinction in the Trinity**
    - The divine unity is the primary reality; distinctions are functional, not ontological.
    - The Son and Spirit are modes of God’s relation to the world and the church.
    - Trinitarian distinctions are not essential to the divine being itself.
    - The doctrine is a post hoc reflection on salvation history, not a revealed mystery.
    - "The threefoldness is not a matter of the divine essence, but of its relation to us." (The Christian Faith, §170)

3. **Economic Trinity as Primary**
    - The **economic Trinity** (God’s self-revelation in history) is the only accessible Trinity.
    - The **immanent Trinity** is largely speculative and unnecessary for faith.
    - The church’s experience of God as Father, Son, and Spirit is foundational.
    - The doctrine serves to articulate the redemptive work of God in Christ and the Spirit.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not an immediate utterance concerning God, but a result of the church’s reflection on redemption." (The Christian Faith, §172)

4. **Christology as the Center of Trinitarian Reflection**
    - The person of Christ is the locus of God’s self-revelation.
    - The Son is understood as the archetype of God-consciousness realized in humanity.
    - The Spirit is the ongoing presence of Christ in the community.
    - Trinitarian doctrine is shaped by the church’s experience of Christ and the Spirit.
    - "The Redeemer is the one in whom the divine essence has become fully present." (The Christian Faith, §93)

5. **Doctrine as Secondary to Piety**
    - Doctrinal formulations are subordinate to the lived experience of faith.
    - The Trinity is not a test of orthodoxy but an expression of communal piety.
    - Theological language is symbolic and expressive, not metaphysical.
    - The church’s confessional life shapes, but does not dictate, doctrinal development.
    - "Dogmatic statements are only the outer form of the inner life of faith." (The Christian Faith, §11)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to the **Trinity** paved the way for later developments such as **Rahner’s Rule**, emphasizing the inseparability of God’s being and God’s actions in history. His prioritization of **religious experience** and the economic Trinity influenced both liberal and neo-orthodox trajectories, including Barth’s critical engagement and reformulation. While often critiqued for minimizing the ontological distinctions within the Godhead, Schleiermacher’s legacy endures in modern discussions of the relationship between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.
