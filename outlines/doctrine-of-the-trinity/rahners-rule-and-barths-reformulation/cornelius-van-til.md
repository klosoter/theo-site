# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til critically engaged with **Rahner’s Rule** (“the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa”) and **Barth’s reformulation** by emphasizing the necessity of a consistently **Reformed doctrine of God**. Van Til argued that both Rahner and Barth failed to uphold the absolute **ontological distinction** between the Creator and the creature, leading to a compromise of **Trinitarian orthodoxy** and the **self-contained God** of Scripture.

- "If God is not self-contained, then there is no ultimate distinction between God and man." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Absolute Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God’s being is wholly distinct from creation; there is no continuum of being.
    - Any collapse of the ontological distinction undermines the doctrine of the Trinity.
    - Rahner’s Rule risks blurring the line between God’s immanent and economic existence.
    - Barth’s approach, while critical of classical metaphysics, still fails to maintain the Reformed distinction.
    - "The Creator-creature distinction is basic to all Christian theology." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Self-Contained Triune God**
    - God is self-sufficient and independent in His Trinitarian existence.
    - The Trinity is not constituted by or dependent on God’s acts in history.
    - Rahner’s and Barth’s formulations threaten the aseity of God.
    - True knowledge of God rests on His self-revelation as the self-contained Trinity.
    - "God is a self-contained being; He does not need the world in order to be Himself." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Revelation as Analogical, Not Univocal**
    - Human knowledge of God is analogical, reflecting the Creator-creature distinction.
    - Barth’s dialectical theology and Rahner’s existentialism risk collapsing analogy into identity.
    - The economic Trinity reveals the immanent Trinity, but does not exhaust or define it.
    - Scripture, not experience or history, is the norm for Trinitarian doctrine.
    - "We must think God’s thoughts after Him, analogically, not univocally." (Christian Theistic Evidences)

4. **Critique of Modernist and Neo-Orthodox Tendencies**
    - Van Til saw Rahner’s and Barth’s approaches as concessions to modern philosophy.
    - Both theologians, in different ways, subordinate the doctrine of God to human categories.
    - The Reformed tradition insists on the primacy of God’s self-revelation over philosophical speculation.
    - Any identification of the economic with the immanent Trinity risks modalism or historicism.
    - "Barth’s theology is a compromise with modernism at the most basic level." (Christianity and Barthianism)

5. **Scripture as the Norm for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - The doctrine of the Trinity must be derived from biblical revelation, not philosophical reflection.
    - Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation are measured against the sufficiency of Scripture.
    - The economic and immanent Trinity are distinguished by Scripture, not by speculative theology.
    - The Reformed confessions safeguard the biblical doctrine of the Trinity.
    - "The Scriptures alone must be our standard in all theological formulation." (The Doctrine of Scripture)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s rigorous defense of the **Creator-creature distinction** and the **self-contained Trinity** has shaped Reformed critiques of modern and neo-orthodox Trinitarian theology. His engagement with Rahner and Barth remains influential in discussions about the relationship between the **economic** and **immanent Trinity**, especially within confessional Reformed circles. Van Til’s insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and analogical reasoning continues to inform contemporary debates on the doctrine of God.
