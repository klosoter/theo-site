# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame critically engages with **Rahner’s Rule**—the assertion that "the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa"—and **Barth’s reformulation** of Trinitarian theology through his own **multiperspectival** and **biblically grounded** approach. Frame affirms the inseparability of the **economic** and **immanent Trinity** but cautions against collapsing the distinction, emphasizing the priority of **Scripture** and the necessity of maintaining both unity and distinction within the **Trinitarian** doctrine.

- "We must not allow the economic Trinity to swallow up the immanent Trinity, nor vice versa; both are necessary for a biblical doctrine of God." (The Doctrine of God)

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought (1995)
- "Trinity" in The Collected Shorter Writings of John Frame, Vol. 1 (2012)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scriptural Priority in Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Insists that all Trinitarian formulations must be grounded in **biblical revelation**.
    - Critiques speculative approaches that go beyond or against Scripture.
    - Sees **Rahner’s Rule** as helpful but potentially misleading if detached from biblical data.
    - Argues that the **economic** and **immanent Trinity** must be understood through the lens of redemptive history.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity must be derived from Scripture, not from philosophical speculation." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Multiperspectivalism Applied to the Trinity**
    - Applies his **triperspectival** method (normative, situational, existential) to Trinitarian theology.
    - Emphasizes that different perspectives (e.g., economic vs. immanent) are complementary, not contradictory.
    - Warns against absolutizing any single perspective, including Rahner’s or Barth’s.
    - Sees the **unity and diversity** of the Trinity reflected in the need for multiple perspectives.
    - "Multiperspectivalism helps us avoid reductionism in Trinitarian theology." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Cautions Against Collapsing Distinctions**
    - Warns that Rahner’s Rule, if misapplied, can blur the distinction between **God’s eternal being** and His actions in history.
    - Maintains that the **immanent Trinity** is not exhaustively revealed in the **economic Trinity**.
    - Affirms that God’s inner life remains mysterious, even as He reveals Himself.
    - Stresses the importance of both **oneness** and **threeness** in God.
    - "We must not identify the economic Trinity with the immanent Trinity in a way that erases the mystery of God’s inner life." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Critical Engagement with Barth**
    - Appreciates Barth’s emphasis on revelation and the centrality of Christ.
    - Critiques Barth for sometimes conflating the **economic** and **immanent Trinity**.
    - Argues that Barth’s approach, while corrective of some errors, risks undermining the **ontological distinction** within God.
    - Sees value in Barth’s Christocentrism but insists on a broader biblical witness.
    - "Barth’s reformulation is valuable, but it must be tested by the whole counsel of God in Scripture." (The Doctrine of God)

5. **Emphasis on Mystery and Worship**
    - Upholds the **mystery** of the Trinity as essential to Christian worship.
    - Warns against rationalistic reductions of Trinitarian doctrine.
    - Sees the doctrine as leading to doxology, not mere speculation.
    - Encourages humility before the incomprehensibility of God’s triune being.
    - "The Trinity is not a puzzle to be solved, but a mystery to be adored." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s engagement with **Rahner’s Rule** and **Barth’s reformulation** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the **Trinity**, especially through his insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the value of multiple theological perspectives. His work has encouraged theologians to avoid both reductionism and speculation, fostering a balanced approach that honors both the unity and distinction within the Godhead. Frame’s influence is evident in the ongoing emphasis on biblical theology and the recovery of mystery in Trinitarian worship.
