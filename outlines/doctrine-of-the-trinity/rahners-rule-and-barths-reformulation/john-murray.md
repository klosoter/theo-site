# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in 20th-century **Reformed theology**, engaged deeply with the doctrines of the **Trinity** and **Christology**, though he did not directly address "Rahner’s Rule" or Karl Barth’s reformulation. Murray’s approach to the relationship between the **economic and immanent Trinity** was shaped by his commitment to the **biblical revelation** and the **unity of God’s being and acts**. He emphasized the inseparability of God’s self-disclosure in history from His eternal nature, aligning with the spirit, if not the letter, of Rahner’s and Barth’s insights.

- "The revelation of God in redemption is the revelation of what God is in himself." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

    - Stressed that God’s actions in history reveal His eternal being.
    - Rejected any separation between who God is and what God does.
    - Saw the **Trinitarian missions** as grounded in the eternal relations of the Godhead.
    - Affirmed that redemption discloses the true character of God.
    - "The acts of God in history are the acts of the triune God, expressive of his eternal being." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Primacy of Biblical Revelation**
    - Insisted that all theological formulations must arise from Scripture.
    - Critiqued speculative approaches to the Trinity not rooted in biblical data.
    - Emphasized the sufficiency of **special revelation** for understanding God’s nature.
    - Saw the economic Trinity as the proper starting point for theological reflection.
    - "We must always begin with the revelation God has given of himself in his Word." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Speculative Distinctions**
    - Opposed sharp dichotomies between the immanent and economic Trinity.
    - Warned against philosophical abstractions in Trinitarian theology.
    - Maintained that God’s being and acts are never in conflict.
    - Affirmed the mystery of the Trinity while upholding biblical clarity.
    - "There is no warrant for positing a God behind the God revealed." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Christological Focus in Trinitarian Revelation**
    - Saw the incarnation as the supreme revelation of the triune God.
    - Emphasized the unity of the person and work of Christ.
    - Held that Christ’s redemptive mission reveals the eternal counsel of God.
    - Affirmed the inseparability of **Christology** and **Trinitarian doctrine**.
    - "In Christ we see the fullness of the Godhead bodily." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Continuity with Reformed Orthodoxy**
    - Upheld classic Reformed confessions regarding the Trinity.
    - Interpreted new theological trends through the lens of historic Reformed theology.
    - Engaged critically with modern developments (including Barth) while maintaining confessional boundaries.
    - Affirmed the **immutability** and **simplicity** of God in all His works.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all true theology." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of the **unity of God’s being and acts** has influenced generations of Reformed theologians wrestling with the implications of Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation. While not directly engaging these figures, his insistence on the primacy of **biblical revelation** and the rejection of speculative dichotomies has provided a framework for evaluating modern Trinitarian theology. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold classical Reformed commitments in dialogue with contemporary theological developments.
