# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann critically engages **Rahner’s Rule**—that the "economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa"—by grounding **trinitarian doctrine** in the historical revelation of God through the crucified and risen Christ. He interacts with **Barth’s reformulation** of the Trinity, advocating for a dynamic, relational understanding that roots **trinitarian identity** in the events of **Christ’s passion** and the **Spirit’s eschatological work**.

- "The history of Jesus is the history of God; the history of God is the history of Jesus." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Key Works

- The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God
- The Crucified God
- Theology of Hope
- Experiences in Theology
- History and the Triune God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Economic and Immanent Trinity are inseparable**
    - Affirms **Rahner’s Rule** as foundational for trinitarian theology.
    - Insists that God’s self-revelation in history truly reveals God’s eternal being.
    - Rejects any separation between the **economic** and **immanent Trinity** as speculative or docetic.
    - Emphasizes that God’s actions in **salvation history** reveal God’s inner life.
    - "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

2. **Trinitarian identity revealed in the cross and resurrection**
    - The crucifixion is the central event where God’s **trinitarian being** is disclosed.
    - The suffering of the Son and the abandonment by the Father are real events within God.
    - The Spirit’s presence in the resurrection completes the **trinitarian revelation**.
    - Opposes any theology that abstracts God’s being from the history of Jesus.
    - "The cross is the open Trinity." (The Crucified God)

3. **Critique and development of Barth’s reformulation**
    - Appreciates **Barth’s** focus on revelation but critiques his tendency toward modalism.
    - Argues that Barth’s “modes of being” language risks obscuring real distinctions within the Trinity.
    - Seeks a more robust account of **trinitarian relations** grounded in history.
    - Proposes that God’s self-differentiation is actualized in the events of salvation.
    - "Barth’s trinitarian doctrine remains too closely tied to the concept of revelation and does not sufficiently develop the mutual relationships of the three divine persons." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **Relational and social model of the Trinity**
    - Advocates for a **perichoretic**, mutual-indwelling model of the divine persons.
    - Stresses the importance of **trinitarian communion** for understanding God’s love and openness.
    - Sees the Trinity as the ground for human community and liberation.
    - Connects the **social Trinity** to political and ecclesial praxis.
    - "The unity of the triune God is not monadic, but social." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

5. **Eschatological orientation of trinitarian theology**
    - The Trinity is revealed in the forward movement of history toward **new creation**.
    - The Spirit’s work is essential for the ongoing realization of God’s trinitarian life in the world.
    - **Eschatology** is not an appendix but integral to understanding God’s being and action.
    - The future of God is the horizon for trinitarian revelation and participation.
    - "The trinitarian history of God is an open history, moving toward its eschatological consummation." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s engagement with **Rahner’s Rule** and Barth’s reformulation has significantly shaped contemporary **trinitarian theology**, especially in emphasizing the inseparability of God’s being and action. His insistence on the historical and relational character of the Trinity has influenced both academic and ecclesial discussions, fostering renewed interest in the doctrine’s practical and social implications. Moltmann’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to articulate a dynamic, participatory vision of the triune God rooted in the events of Christ and the Spirit’s eschatological mission.
