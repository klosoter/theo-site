# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not formulate **Rahner’s Rule** or directly engage **Barth’s reformulation**, but his doctrine of **the Trinity** and **the relationship between God’s essence and persons** laid foundational groundwork for later discussions. Aquinas maintained a careful distinction between the **immanent Trinity** (God in Himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s actions in history), emphasizing the unity of **divine essence** while affirming real distinctions among the **divine persons**.

- "It must be said that the distinction of the divine persons is not according to the essence but according to the relations." (Summa Theologiae I, q.39, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, I, Questions 27–43 (on the Trinity)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 1–26
- De Potentia, Questions 9–10
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book I, Distinctions 2–34
- Gilles Emery, The Trinitarian Theology of St Thomas Aquinas (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Immanent and Economic Trinity**
    - The **immanent Trinity** refers to God’s inner life, while the **economic Trinity** concerns God’s actions in salvation history.
    - Aquinas insists that the **processions** and **relations** within God are real, not merely conceptual.
    - The **missions** of the Son and Spirit in history reflect, but do not exhaust, their eternal origins.
    - God’s actions in history reveal but do not fully disclose the mystery of His inner life.
    - "The temporal mission only manifests the eternal procession." (Summa Theologiae I, q.43, a.2)

2. **Unity of Divine Essence**
    - All three persons share the same **divine essence**; there is no division in God’s being.
    - The **attributes** of God are predicated of each person equally.
    - The **operations ad extra** (external works) of the Trinity are indivisible.
    - The distinction of persons does not compromise the absolute unity of God.
    - "In God, essence and existence are one and the same." (Summa Theologiae I, q.3, a.4)

3. **Real Distinctions of Persons by Relations of Origin**
    - The persons are distinguished solely by **relations of origin** (paternity, filiation, procession).
    - These relations are subsistent and constitute the persons themselves.
    - There is no distinction of substance or operation among the persons.
    - The **Father**, **Son**, and **Holy Spirit** are coequal and coeternal.
    - "The persons are distinguished by the relations alone." (Summa Theologiae I, q.28, a.3)

4. **Revelation and Knowledge of the Trinity**
    - Human knowledge of the Trinity is grounded in **divine revelation**, not natural reason.
    - The **missions** of the Son and Spirit in salvation history make the Trinity known.
    - The **economic actions** of God point analogically to the eternal relations.
    - Full comprehension of the Trinity remains beyond human grasp.
    - "We know the Trinity only by revelation, not by natural reason." (Summa Theologiae I, q.32, a.1)

5. **Analogy and Theological Language**
    - Theological language about God is **analogical**, not univocal or equivocal.
    - Terms applied to God and creatures signify perfections in God in a higher mode.
    - Analogical predication safeguards both **divine transcendence** and meaningful discourse.
    - This approach undergirds Aquinas’s careful distinctions in Trinitarian theology.
    - "We cannot know what God is, but only what He is not." (Summa Contra Gentiles I, ch.30)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s rigorous distinctions between the **immanent and economic Trinity** provided a framework that later theologians, including Rahner and Barth, would critically engage. His insistence on the unity of **divine essence** and the real distinction of persons by **relations of origin** shaped the Western tradition’s approach to Trinitarian doctrine. While Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation sought to overcome perceived gaps between God’s inner life and His revelation, Aquinas’s careful metaphysical and theological distinctions remain a touchstone for ongoing debates about the relationship between the **economic** and **immanent Trinity**.
