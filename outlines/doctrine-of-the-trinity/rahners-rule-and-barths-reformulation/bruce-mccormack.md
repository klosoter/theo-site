# Bruce McCormack (1956–)

Bruce McCormack is a leading interpreter of **Karl Barth** and a significant voice in contemporary debates over **Rahner’s Rule**—the assertion that the "economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa." McCormack critically engages both **Rahner’s formulation** and **Barth’s reformulation**, arguing for a **christologically determined doctrine of God** that resists both modalism and subordinationism, and foregrounds the **event-character of divine self-revelation**.

- "The immanent Trinity is constituted in and through the event of God’s self-revelation in history." ("Karl Barth’s Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology")

## Key Works

- "The Actuality of God: Karl Barth’s Doctrine of God"
- "Karl Barth and the Problem of the Trinity"

- "Trinity and Election in Contemporary Theology" (in *The Oxford Handbook of Karl Barth*)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Reformulation of Rahner’s Rule**
    - Argues that **Barth** does not simply repeat Rahner’s Rule but reconfigures it through a **christological lens**.
    - Emphasizes that the **economic Trinity** is constitutive for the **immanent Trinity**, not merely revelatory.
    - Rejects any static conception of God apart from God’s self-revelation in Christ.
    - Maintains that God’s being is determined in the act of **election**.
    - "Barth’s doctrine of the Trinity is not an abstract metaphysical speculation, but a function of his doctrine of revelation." (Karl Barth’s Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology)

2. **Event-Character of Divine Being**
    - God’s being is not a timeless substance but an event realized in history.
    - The **immanent Trinity** is actualized in the **economic Trinity**.
    - God’s identity is inseparable from God’s acts in Christ.
    - The doctrine of God must be grounded in the history of Jesus.
    - "God is the One who determines himself to be God for us in the event of revelation." (The Actuality of God)

3. **Primacy of Christology in Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Christology is the starting point for understanding the Trinity.
    - The doctrine of election is central to God’s triune identity.
    - The Son’s history is constitutive for the being of God.
    - Rejects any separation between the **Jesus of history** and the **Christ of faith**.
    - "The being of God is determined by the history of Jesus Christ." (Trinity and Election in Contemporary Theology)

4. **Critique of Essentialist Trinitarianism**
    - Opposes views that posit a divine essence prior to or apart from God’s self-revelation.
    - Warns against collapsing the Trinity into abstract metaphysics.
    - Affirms that God’s triunity is revealed and actualized in salvation history.
    - Stresses the dynamic, relational character of divine life.
    - "There is no God behind the back of Jesus Christ." (Karl Barth’s Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology)

5. **Doctrine of Election as Ontological Ground**
    - Election is not merely a decree but the ground of God’s triune being.
    - God determines himself to be God in the act of electing grace.
    - The doctrine of election shapes the doctrine of the Trinity from within.
    - Election is the key to understanding the unity and distinction within the Godhead.
    - "God is who he is in the act of electing and being elected." (The Actuality of God)

## Legacy and Impact

McCormack’s work has decisively shaped contemporary readings of **Barth’s doctrine of the Trinity** and the ongoing debate over **Rahner’s Rule**. His insistence on the **event-character of divine being** and the centrality of **christology** has influenced both Barth scholarship and broader systematic theology. By foregrounding the doctrine of election as ontologically determinative, McCormack has challenged classical essentialist accounts of God and opened new avenues for understanding the relationship between the **economic** and **immanent Trinity**. His contributions continue to provoke discussion on the nature of divine self-revelation and the identity of the triune God.
