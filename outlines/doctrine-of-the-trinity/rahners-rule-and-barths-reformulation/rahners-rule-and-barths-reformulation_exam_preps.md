### ESSAY
Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation sit at the nerve center of contemporary trinitarian theology because they force the question of how the **economic Trinity**, God as revealed and operative in salvation history, relates to the **immanent Trinity**, God in his eternal life in and of himself. What is at stake is not a speculative curiosity about divine inner life, but the trustworthiness of revelation, the coherence of **classical theism**, and the stability of dogmatic loci such as Christology, soteriology, and revelation. If who God is in himself can float free from who God is toward us in Christ and the Spirit, revelation becomes opaque and the gospel uncertain. Yet if God’s eternal being is simply collapsed into history, God is absorbed into the flux of becoming, undercutting **immutability**, **aseity**, and the **Creator–creature distinction**. Rahner and Barth both attempt to navigate between these perils by articulating rules that bind together, yet distinguish, the immanent and economic Trinity.

To see what is new, one must first recover what is not. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas provide the baseline against which Rahner and Barth are reacting and to which they must be held accountable. Augustine’s De Trinitate stands as the paradigmatic patristic grappling with this relation. Augustine insists that all temporal missions of the Son and Spirit presuppose and manifest their eternal **processions** from the Father. The Son’s being sent in time presupposes his eternal generation; the Spirit’s being poured out presupposes his eternal spiration. This is the doctrine of **inseparable operations**: all the works of the Trinity in creation and redemption are undivided, though they are fittingly appropriated to particular persons to reflect their eternal relations of origin. For Augustine, therefore, the economic Trinity truly reveals the immanent Trinity, yet always within the constraints of **analogical knowledge**. The Trinity is not simply “projected” from history; rather, in the history of Christ and the gift of the Spirit we receive, under temporal veils, an access to the one eternal Trinity whose life infinitely exceeds its temporal manifestations.

Aquinas develops this Augustinian inheritance with greater metaphysical precision. In the Summa Theologiae, he grounds the doctrine of God in **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **pure actuality**. There is in God no composition, no potency, no real distinction between essence and existence. The divine processions are not temporal events but eternal relations, and on these relations rest the real personal distinctions. Yet Aquinas also insists that missions are the temporal terms of eternal processions. When the Son is incarnate, or the Spirit is sent, nothing changes in God; the change is in the creature’s relation to God. Nonetheless, what is given in that changed relation is a true revelation of the eternal relations. The economic missions are, in Aquinas’s language, a “new mode” in which the same eternal person is present to creatures. This allows Aquinas to affirm simultaneously that the economy is a genuine disclosure of the immanent life, and that the immanent life is not produced by or altered through the economy. The economic Trinity thus has strict ontological dependence on the immanent Trinity, but not vice versa.

This classic pattern will be the main plumb line for evaluating Rahner and Barth. Examiners will press here: does your account of Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation really maintain the asymmetry of dependence that Augustine and Aquinas insist upon? Or does it introduce a reciprocity in which the economic history bears constitutive weight for God’s eternal being? My position is that Rahner and Barth each intend to secure a trustworthy relation between God’s self-communication and God’s being, and when read in continuity with pro-Nicene theology, they can be received as legitimate clarificatory rules. But both are easily misread, and some of their formulations lend themselves to historicizing or relational revisions of classical theism. The task in an oral defense is to show how to appropriate their insights while refusing the ontological slide.

Karl Rahner, writing in the mid twentieth century as a Roman Catholic theologian deeply shaped by transcendental Thomism, introduces what has become known as “Rahner’s Rule” in his The Trinity. The rule can be stated as follows: “The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity.” Rahner is responding to what he perceived as a divorce between speculative trinitarian doctrine and lived Christian experience, a divorce exacerbated by neo-scholastic treatments that rendered the Trinity largely an abstract metaphysical schema. In his view, if the Triune God who is confessed in dogma is not the very God who encounters us in revelation, then trinitarian doctrine becomes functionally irrelevant to salvation and spirituality.

The positive intention of Rahner’s Rule is to guarantee that in God’s self-communication in history we truly meet God himself, not merely an instrumental mask or created symbol. By saying that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, Rahner insists that the God who acts in creation, in Israel, in Christ, and in the church is not other than God as he is in himself. There is no “behind” of the divine essence that could be different from this self-communication. Conversely, by saying that the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity, Rahner denies that there is some surplus trinitarian “fourth” that never comes to expression in revelation. The fullness of the triune life is indeed what is communicated. In this sense, Rahner’s Rule is a strong statement of **revelational realism**: God’s saving history is the self-gift of the triune God.

However, the exact wording of Rahner’s Rule invites several dangers that examiners will press. Does this not imply that God’s eternal being is constituted by or exhausted in the economy? Does “is” denote identity in a univocal sense, collapsing the Creator–creature distinction? Does it compromise **immutability** by making God’s triune life dependent upon historical events? Here Augustine and Aquinas function as critical correctives. At points, Rahner explicitly affirms their commitments: he maintains that God’s being is absolutely immutable and that the economic self-communication is a free act of grace. Yet he also develops a transcendental account of human subjectivity and grace that tends to blur the distinction between nature and grace and to emphasize God’s self-communication as constitutive of the human subject’s ultimate horizon. This anthropological orientation risks reading the Trinity primarily from the standpoint of Christian experience and the history of salvation, rather than from the eternal processions grounding the economic missions.

Properly constrained, Rahner’s Rule can be reformulated analogically: the economic Trinity truly and sufficiently reveals the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the ultimate ground of the economy, though the divine life remains infinitely more than what is manifest in history. The “is” must be read as an identity-in-revelation, not an ontological identity that cancels transcendence. To say the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity means that there is no other God than the one who reveals himself thus, and that this revelation is internally grounded in who God eternally is. To say the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity is to say that this very Trinity, and not a different reality, is what is given in the history of salvation. But classical commitments to **divine simplicity** and **aseity** still insist that God’s life is not caused by, nor modified through, that history.

Here Hans Urs von Balthasar illustrates both the fruitful appropriation and potential overextension of Rahner’s Rule. Balthasar, also a Roman Catholic theologian, develops a profoundly Christocentric and dramatic theology of the Trinity, especially in his Theo-Drama. He wants to take with absolute seriousness that in the cross and descent of Christ we see into the depths of God’s triune love. He develops a notion of “trinitarian kenosis” or self-surrender within the immanent Trinity, interpreting the economic abandonment of the Son as a revelation of eternal relations of self-giving between Father, Son, and Spirit. On the one hand, Balthasar’s move can be seen as a maximal confidence in Rahner’s Rule: what God does in the economic drama really does open a window into his inner life. On the other hand, Balthasar edges toward reading the inner life through the outer event in a manner that many critics see as introducing suffering, change, or even a kind of intratrinitarian tension into the immanent life. That would depart from Augustine and Aquinas and move toward a historicized or passible doctrine of God.

This reveals an internal debate among those who accept Rahner’s Rule. One side, drawing on classical theism, reads it as a rule of **epistemological access**: the economy is the true revelation of the immanent life, under the conditions of temporal and created mediation. The other side, influenced by Hegelian or process thought, reads it as a rule of **ontological constitution**: the divine life in itself includes or is determined by its historical self-unfolding. The latter use the rule to justify doctrines of divine becoming, intrinsic divine suffering, or a mutual God–world dependence. In an exam setting, one must firmly reject this second trajectory as incompatible with **immutability**, **impassibility**, and **pure actuality**, while affirming the first as a necessary guard against any Nestorianism between God in se and God pro nobis.

Karl Barth’s reformulation of the relation between immanent and economic Trinity emerges from a different set of concerns yet intersects deeply with Rahner. Working within Reformed dogmatics and reacting against both liberalism and a certain Protestant scholasticism, Barth wants to ground all knowledge of God in God’s free self-revelation in Jesus Christ. In Church Dogmatics, especially volume I/1 and II/1, Barth articulates a programmatic rule: “God’s being is in his act” and “God is who he is in the act of his revelation.” This is then given trinitarian content: God is the one who reveals himself, the act of revelation, and the revealedness, which Barth correlates respectively with Father, Son, and Spirit. In a different idiom, Barth is saying something structurally similar to Rahner: God is in himself who he is toward us in revelation.

Yet Barth’s metaphysical instincts differ from Rahner’s in several important respects that are crucial in an oral defense. First, Barth is suspicious of any attempt to access the immanent Trinity through a prior metaphysics. He resists the Thomistic account of **divine simplicity** as a framework that could be known before or apart from revelation in Christ. For Barth, all ontology must be a posteriori to revelation. Second, he stresses the freedom and lordship of God in revelation: God does not become triune because he reveals himself, but is eternally triune and freely chooses that his immanent triune life corresponds to his historical revealing. Barth thus seeks to maintain an asymmetrical relation: God’s being is not determined by his act, but the act is the outward form of the eternal being.

Barth’s most provocative formulation is that God’s being is a “being in act” and a “being for us.” Critics have accused Barth of making God eternally dependent on creation, of collapsing the immanent into the economic, or of making the decree of election constitutive of the Trinity in a way that undermines divine freedom. The sharper versions of this critique focus on his doctrine that Jesus Christ is the subject and object of election and that election is an eternal decision within the triune life. If not carefully handled, this can sound like God’s triune identity depends on the decision to become incarnate and to redeem. Barth, however, explicitly denies that God is dependent on the world; the decision of election is internal to God’s freedom and not conditioned by anything creaturely. The “for us” of God’s being must therefore be understood as an eternal free disposition of God’s life, not a temporal addition.

Barth’s reformulation of the relation between immanent and economic Trinity therefore runs parallel to Rahner’s Rule but is christologically asymmetrical. Where Rahner’s formulation is symmetric and could be read as establishing a two-way “is”, Barth wishes to preserve that revelation in Christ is not only identical with who God is, but that it is the way we know who this eternal God is, and it never becomes the cause of his being. In this, there is a convergent insight with Augustine and Aquinas: the missions manifest the processions but do not constitute them. Barth simply refuses to explicate those processions in pre-revelatory metaphysical categories, preferring to derive everything from the concrete history of Jesus Christ and to read election and reconciliation as intrinsic to the triune identity manifested there.

In Reformed circles, an internal debate has emerged over whether Barth’s rule is compatible with confessional Reformed **federal theology** and classical **immutability**. Some see Barth as abandoning traditional doctrines of decree and aseity by making covenant and election determinative of God’s being. Others argue that when his insistence on divine freedom and self-groundedness is taken seriously, his “being in act” is not a becoming but the eternal liveliness of fully actualized triune life, consistent with a robust, if un-Thomistic, classical theism. Under oral examination, one must concede that Barth’s idiom courts misunderstanding and that some of his formulations are unstable, but also argue that the thrust of his doctrine resists ontological mutuality between God and the world.

Externally, the debates around Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation intersect with social trinitarianism, process theology, and open theism. Social trinitarians often seize Rahner’s Rule to argue that the perichoretic, relational dynamics manifest in the economy are the blueprint for human community and that God’s inner life is a society of centers of consciousness. Process theologians and open theists push further, interpreting the history of God’s interaction with the world as literally constitutive of divine becoming, suggesting that God’s knowledge, will, or even triune identity develop over time. These moves reject or severely modify **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **pure actuality**, and use the economic history, grounded in Rahner-like slogans, to justify ontological revision.

The proper response, rooted in Augustine and Aquinas, and supported at crucial points by Barth’s emphasis on divine freedom, is to insist that Rahner’s Rule and its Barthian analogue are fundamentally about the identity of the Revealer: there is no other God than the one manifested in Christ and by the Spirit. They are not about the causality of revelation upon God’s being. To use the economy as a lever to change the doctrine of God is, on this view, to invert the order of dependence. The immanent Trinity grounds the economy; the economy reveals the immanent Trinity; but the economy does not ontologically constitute the Trinity.

Contemporary debates extend these concerns into issues of divine suffering and political or liberation theologies. Many theologians who affirm the necessity of a suffering God appeal to Rahner’s Rule, arguing that if God truly suffers in Christ economically, then this must reveal a God who is in himself open to suffering, risk, and vulnerability. Similarly, political and liberation theologians appeal to the economic history of God’s solidarity with the oppressed as revelatory of a God whose eternal being is preferentially oriented toward the marginalized. In both cases, Rahner’s conviction that the immanent Trinity is not other than the economic Trinity is pressed into a material norm for reconstructing the doctrine of God.

The defended position here must be carefully articulated. One can affirm that in Christ God truly suffers and truly identifies with the oppressed in history, and that this is a genuine revelation of God’s eternal love and righteousness, without inferring that God as God undergoes ontological change or is passible in his essence. Divine **impassibility** properly understood, following Aquinas, does not deny that God is deeply involved and truly affected relationally by the world; it denies that God can be overcome, injured, or altered in his being by anything outside himself. Rahner’s Rule, interpreted analogically, affirms that the suffering of Christ is the suffering of the eternal Son according to his assumed humanity, and that this manifests the depth of eternal triune love. It does not require the conclusion that the divine nature itself is passible. Barth’s insistence that God is free Lord in his suffering, not coerced by history, supports this classical line.

Thus a properly constrained Rahner’s Rule, sharpened by Barth’s Christological asymmetry and undergirded by Augustine’s and Aquinas’s commitments to **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **inseparable operations**, yields a coherent account: the economic Trinity is the true, reliable self-presentation of the immanent Trinity; there is no hidden, different God. Yet the direction of grounding runs from immanent to economic, not the reverse. Revelation is ontologically grounded in God’s eternal life, while God’s eternal life is not constituted by revelation. To say that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity is to confess the identity of the one triune God in both modes of existence; to say that the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity is to confess that what is shown in the economy is precisely this God, not a lesser or different reality. The “is” in both clauses is thus an identity of subject, not an equation of modes.

An examiner might press: if you insist on this asymmetry, have you not emptied Rahner’s Rule of its critical force, reverting to premodern axioms and rendering it redundant? The answer is that the rule remains necessary against any bifurcation of God in se and God pro nobis that would imply a dualism in God. It compels dogmatics to do trinitarian theology on the basis of revelation, insisting that we have no access to a non-Christological God. Yet it does this within the metaphysical grammar of **classical theism**, refusing to treat the economy as a causal factor in God’s being. In Barth’s idiom, this means that God’s being in act is not a becoming but the eternal outgoing fullness of the triune life.

In sum, Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation, read through Augustine and Aquinas and tested against the excesses of Balthasar and more radical historicizing tendencies, can be defended as faithful to the Christian confession that the God who saves us in Christ and the Spirit is none other than the eternal Father, Son, and Spirit, whose inner life is perfectly fulfilled, simple, immutable, and free. They challenge any abstract separation of immanent and economic Trinity, but must themselves be disciplined by the Creator–creature distinction and by the ontological priority of God’s immanent life over his historical self-manifestation.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Rahner’s Rule affirms that “the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity,” while Barth’s reformulation asserts that God’s **being in act** in revelation is identical with who God eternally is, both functioning as rules for relating **economic** and **immanent Trinity** under **classical theism**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: grounds missions in eternal processions, insists on **inseparable operations** and **analogical knowledge**.
  - Thomas Aquinas: articulates **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and missions as temporal terms of eternal processions; secures asymmetry between immanent and economic Trinity.
  - Karl Rahner: formulates the Rule to bind God’s self-communication to God’s being, risks symmetric readings that can be historicized if not constrained.
  - Karl Barth: reformulates the relation as “being in act,” Christologically centered; stresses divine freedom, yet expresses himself in ways that court misunderstandings about dependence on the economy.
  - Hans Urs von Balthasar: maximizes Rahner’s intuition, reading economic drama as deep disclosure of intratrinitarian love, but edging toward a passible or tension-filled Trinity.
- Debates:
  - Internal: among Catholic and Protestant theologians on whether Rahner’s Rule is epistemic or ontological; among Reformed theologians on whether Barth’s position preserves **immutability** and **aseity**.
  - External: social trinitarian, process, and open theist uses of the economy to reconstruct God’s being; classical theism’s insistence on ontological priority of the immanent Trinity.
  - Contemporary: appeals to Rahner’s Rule to ground divine passibility, divine becoming, and politicized or liberationist reconstructions of the Trinity.
- Defended position: Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation are valid and necessary as rules of identity between the Revealer and the revealed God, but must be strictly interpreted within the Augustinian–Thomistic grammar of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, **aseity**, and **Creator–creature distinction**, preserving the ontological asymmetry: the immanent Trinity grounds and is revealed by, but is not constituted by, the economy.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does Rahner’s “is” entail ontological identity that collapses transcendence? Answer: No, read analogically as identity of subject in two ordered modes, not as univocal equation of being.
  - How does Barth avoid making God dependent on election and incarnation? Answer: By locating election as an eternal, free act within the triune life that presupposes, rather than constitutes, God’s triune being.
  - Can you affirm real divine suffering in Christ while holding impassibility? Answer: Yes, the Son truly suffers according to his humanity; this reveals the depth of eternal triune love without introducing change in the divine essence.
  - What does “the economy reveals the immanent Trinity” add beyond classical doctrine? Answer: It rules out any split between a “speculative” and a “practical” Trinity, insisting that all doctrine of God be grounded in God’s concrete self-revelation in Christ and the Spirit.
