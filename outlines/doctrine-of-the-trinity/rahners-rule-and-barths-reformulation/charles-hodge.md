# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, approached the relationship between the **economic and immanent Trinity** with a strong commitment to classical **Reformed orthodoxy**. While he did not explicitly engage with "Rahner’s Rule" or Barth’s reformulation, Hodge’s doctrine of God emphasized the **immutability** and **aseity** of the divine essence, maintaining a clear distinction between God’s eternal being and His temporal works. His approach resists any collapse of the **immanent Trinity** into the **economic Trinity**, upholding the traditional Western distinction.

- "The distinction between the immanent and the economic Trinity is essential to the preservation of the doctrine of the Trinity itself." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on the Trinity
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immutability of the Divine Essence**
    - God’s essence does not change in relation to His works in history.
    - The **immanent Trinity** is eternally who God is, apart from creation or redemption.
    - The **economic Trinity** reveals but does not constitute the inner life of God.
    - Any identification of the economic with the immanent threatens divine immutability.
    - "God is what He is in Himself, independently of all His works." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Distinction between Immanent and Economic Trinity**
    - The **immanent Trinity** refers to God’s eternal relations ad intra.
    - The **economic Trinity** concerns God’s actions ad extra in creation and redemption.
    - The two must be distinguished to avoid modalism or tritheism.
    - Revelation in history is a true disclosure, not a constitutive event for God’s being.
    - "The Scriptures teach that the distinctions in the Godhead are eternal, not dependent on the works of God." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Revelation as Accommodation**
    - God reveals Himself in ways suited to human understanding.
    - The economic missions are adapted to creaturely capacities, not to God’s own being.
    - The **Son** and **Spirit** are sent in history, but their eternal relations are unchanged.
    - Revelation is analogical, not univocal, to God’s inner life.
    - "All our knowledge of God is derived from His manifestations, but these do not exhaust His being." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Rejection of Speculative Trinitarianism**
    - Hodge resists speculative attempts to deduce the Trinity from philosophical principles.
    - He insists on the sufficiency of biblical revelation for Trinitarian doctrine.
    - The mystery of the Trinity is to be preserved, not rationalized.
    - Attempts to ground the Trinity in history or consciousness are viewed with suspicion.
    - "We must be content to receive what God has revealed, and not attempt to be wise above what is written." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Classical Theism and Divine Simplicity**
    - God’s attributes and persons are not separable parts but subsist in the one divine essence.
    - The **simplicity** of God undergirds the unity of the immanent and economic Trinity.
    - The divine persons are distinguished by eternal relations of origin, not by historical missions.
    - The unity of God is never compromised by His actions in redemptive history.
    - "The three persons are the one God, differing only in their mode of subsistence." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **distinction between the immanent and economic Trinity** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially in the American context. His resistance to speculative or historicizing tendencies in Trinitarian theology stands in marked contrast to later developments such as **Rahner’s Rule** and Barth’s reformulation. Hodge’s influence endures in conservative Reformed circles, where the **immutability** and **aseity** of God remain central. His work continues to be a touchstone for those wary of collapsing the eternal being of God into His temporal actions.
