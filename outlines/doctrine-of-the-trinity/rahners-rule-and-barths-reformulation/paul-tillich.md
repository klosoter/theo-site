# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich engaged critically with **Rahner’s Rule**—the axiom that the "economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa"—and **Barth’s reformulation** of Trinitarian theology, situating both within his own framework of **symbolic theology** and the **God-world relation**. Tillich emphasized the **self-manifestation of God** in history while maintaining a distinction between the **depth of the divine mystery** and its historical revelation, thus offering a unique perspective on the relationship between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.

- "The assertion that God is manifest in history does not mean that God is exhausted by his manifestation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1–3
- The Courage to Be
- Theology of Culture
- Dynamics of Faith
- Paul Tillich: Theologian of the Boundaries (ed. Mark Kline Taylor)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Symbolic Mediation of the Divine**
    - All language about God, including Trinitarian language, is **symbolic** and points beyond itself.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they refer but never exhaust it.
    - The **Trinity** is a symbol expressing the dynamic relationality within the divine life.
    - Tillich resists literal identification of the **economic** and **immanent Trinity**.
    - "The symbols of the Trinity are expressions of the experience of the divine self-manifestation, not of a metaphysical structure." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **God as Ground of Being**
    - God is not a being among beings but the **ground of being itself**.
    - The distinction between **immanent** and **economic Trinity** is reframed as the distinction between the depth of the divine and its manifestation.
    - God’s self-revelation in history never exhausts the divine mystery.
    - Tillich critiques both Rahner and Barth for insufficiently preserving divine transcendence.
    - "God remains the mystery beyond every manifestation, even in his self-manifestation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Revelation and History**
    - Revelation is the event in which the **ground of being** becomes manifest in history.
    - The **economic Trinity** is the symbol for God’s self-disclosure in time and space.
    - The **immanent Trinity** refers to the eternal structure of divine life, which remains hidden.
    - Tillich affirms the necessity of both, but resists their identification.
    - "Revelation is always a paradox: the mystery becomes manifest, but remains mystery." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Critique of Essentialism in Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Tillich warns against making the **Trinity** an ontological blueprint of God’s essence.
    - He sees Barth’s reformulation as risking a collapse of the economic into the immanent.
    - For Tillich, the **Trinity** must remain a living symbol, not a metaphysical scheme.
    - The divine life is dynamic, not static or essentialist.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is a symbol for the living and dynamic character of the divine life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Correlation Method and Trinitarian Theology**
    - Tillich’s **method of correlation** relates existential questions to theological answers.
    - The **Trinity** answers the existential question of unity and diversity in God’s relation to the world.
    - Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation are interpreted through the lens of existential correlation.
    - The doctrine must speak meaningfully to contemporary human experience.
    - "The symbols of the Christian message must be correlated with the questions implied in human existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **Rahner’s Rule** and **Barth’s reformulation** influenced later discussions on the **symbolic nature of Trinitarian doctrine** and the limits of theological language. His insistence on the **mystery of God** and the dynamic, existential function of doctrine challenged both classical and neo-orthodox Trinitarianism. Tillich’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to articulate the **God-world relation** without collapsing divine transcendence into immanence. His legacy endures in contemporary theology’s ongoing engagement with the boundaries of **systematic theology** and the meaning of **Trinitarian language**.
