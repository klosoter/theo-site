# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann critically engaged with the relationship between the **humanity and divinity of Christ**, as articulated in **Rahner’s Rule** ("the humanity of Jesus is the humanity of God"), but he approached this through his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. Bultmann was skeptical of traditional metaphysical formulations, including **Barth’s reformulation** of the rule, and instead emphasized the **kerygma** and the existential encounter with Christ as the locus of revelation.

- "The New Testament proclamation is not a doctrine about God and men but a message addressed to men in a concrete situation." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Essays Philosophical and Theological (1955)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of the New Testament**
    - The biblical witness must be interpreted apart from mythological worldviews.
    - The **kerygma** is separated from ancient cosmology to speak meaningfully to modern people.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential message behind the text.
    - The focus is on the proclamation, not metaphysical speculation about Christ’s natures.
    - "It is not the objectifying statements about Christ that are decisive, but the existential understanding of his significance." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Christology**
    - The significance of Christ is found in the existential decision he calls forth.
    - The unity of **divinity and humanity** is not a metaphysical assertion but an existential reality for the believer.
    - The encounter with Christ is transformative, not a doctrinal formula.
    - Bultmann resists both Rahner’s and Barth’s ontological formulations in favor of existential response.
    - "Faith in Christ means the existential understanding of oneself as addressed by God." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Priority of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is central, not the metaphysical explanation of his person.
    - The **kerygma** mediates the presence of God in the event of preaching.
    - The humanity of Jesus is the medium of revelation, but not in a metaphysical sense.
    - The divine is encountered in the existential call to decision, not in ontological union.
    - "The real content of the message is the event of God’s address to man." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Rejection of Metaphysical Christology**
    - Bultmann is critical of classical formulations like the **hypostatic union**.
    - He views such doctrines as mythological and inaccessible to modern understanding.
    - The focus is on the existential significance of Christ’s person and work.
    - Barth’s reformulation is seen as still too tied to ontological categories.
    - "We cannot objectify Christ’s divinity; it is only in the act of faith that he is the revealer." (Essays Philosophical and Theological)

5. **Historical Jesus and Faith**
    - The historical Jesus is important, but faith does not rest on historical knowledge.
    - The Christ of faith is encountered in proclamation, not in historical reconstruction.
    - The humanity of Jesus is the vehicle for the existential encounter with God.
    - Rahner’s Rule is reinterpreted: the humanity of Jesus is significant as the medium of revelation, not as a metaphysical assertion.
    - "It is not the historical Jesus, but the proclaimed Christ, who is the object of faith." (History and Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **demythologization** and existential interpretation has profoundly shaped modern theology’s engagement with the **humanity and divinity of Christ**. His critique of metaphysical Christology challenged both Rahner’s and Barth’s attempts to articulate the unity of Christ’s natures, pushing the discussion toward existential and hermeneutical concerns. While controversial, Bultmann’s emphasis on the **kerygma** and the existential encounter with Christ continues to influence New Testament scholarship and contemporary theology. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between history, faith, and doctrinal formulation.
