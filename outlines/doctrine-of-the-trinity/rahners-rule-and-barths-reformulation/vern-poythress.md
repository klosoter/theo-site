# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress addresses **Rahner’s Rule** and **Barth’s reformulation** from a Reformed, **multiperspectival** perspective, emphasizing the inseparability yet distinction of the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**. He insists that **revelation** must govern Trinitarian theology, critiquing Rahner and Barth for not sufficiently grounding their views in **biblical theology** and the **ontological distinction** within the Godhead.

- "We must not let the economic Trinity swallow up the immanent, nor vice versa; both are essential for a biblical doctrine of God." (In the Beginning Was the Word)

## Key Works

- In the Beginning Was the Word: Language—A God-Centered Approach
- The Mystery of the Trinity: A Trinitarian Approach to the Attributes of God
- Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology
- "Reforming Ontology and Logic in the Light of the Trinity: An Application of Van Til’s Idea of Analogy" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Rahner’s Rule and the Trinity: A Multiperspectival Critique" (essay in collected volume)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Norm for Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - Upholds **sola Scriptura** as the foundation for all theological reflection on the Trinity.
    - Critiques philosophical or speculative approaches that lack exegetical grounding.
    - Argues that both Rahner and Barth risk subordinating biblical revelation to theological constructs.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of **redemptive-historical** context in Trinitarian theology.
    "The Bible, not philosophical speculation, must govern our understanding of the Trinity." (The Mystery of the Trinity)

2. **Distinction Without Separation: Immanent and Economic Trinity**
    - Affirms the real distinction between the **immanent Trinity** (God in himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God in relation to creation).
    - Warns against collapsing the ontological distinctions into the historical economy.
    - Sees Rahner’s Rule as helpful but potentially misleading if not carefully qualified.
    - Appreciates Barth’s emphasis on revelation but critiques his tendency toward modalism.
    "The economic actions of God reveal who he is, but do not exhaust the mystery of his eternal being." (Symphonic Theology)

3. **Multiperspectivalism in Trinitarian Reflection**
    - Applies his **multiperspectival** method to avoid reductionism in Trinitarian theology.
    - Argues that both Rahner and Barth privilege certain perspectives at the expense of others.
    - Advocates for integrating ontological, economic, and revelational perspectives.
    - Insists that theological method must reflect the complexity and unity of God’s self-disclosure.
    "No single perspective can capture the fullness of the Triune God; we need a symphony of approaches." (Symphonic Theology)

4. **Analogy and the Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - Stresses the importance of **analogy** in speaking about God, following Van Til.
    - Warns that Rahner’s Rule can blur the **Creator-creature distinction** if misapplied.
    - Argues that Barth’s emphasis on revelation must not erase the ontological gap between God and humanity.
    - Maintains that all human knowledge of God is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
    "Our language about God must always respect the infinite qualitative distinction between Creator and creature." (In the Beginning Was the Word)

5. **Trinitarian Revelation as Covenantal**
    - Frames God’s self-revelation in the economy as fundamentally **covenantal**.
    - Sees the economic Trinity as the outworking of God’s eternal purposes in covenant history.
    - Argues that Rahner’s and Barth’s formulations lack sufficient covenantal grounding.
    - Emphasizes the unity of God’s being and action in the context of redemptive history.
    "The Trinity is revealed in the context of God’s covenantal dealings with his people." (The Mystery of the Trinity)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s engagement with **Rahner’s Rule** and **Barth’s reformulation** has reinforced the importance of **biblical theology** and the **Creator-creature distinction** in contemporary Trinitarian thought. His **multiperspectival** approach has provided a nuanced framework for evaluating modern Trinitarian proposals, ensuring that neither the immanent nor economic Trinity is neglected. Poythress’s work continues to shape Reformed discussions on the doctrine of God, especially in relation to the interplay between revelation, ontology, and redemptive history.
