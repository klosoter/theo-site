# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s theology of the **Trinity** laid foundational groundwork for later discussions on the relationship between the **economic** and **immanent Trinity**, which would become central in debates about **Rahner’s Rule** and **Barth’s reformulation**. While Augustine does not articulate the rule as later theologians do, his insistence on the unity of divine action and the inseparability of the divine persons in external works deeply influenced subsequent trinitarian thought.

- "In all the works of God, the three persons operate inseparably." (De Trinitate I.7)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Confessiones (Confessions)
- Enchiridion
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- Letters and Sermons (selected trinitarian passages)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Divine Essence**
    - God is one **substance** shared equally by Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - There is no division or separation in the divine nature.
    - The **persons** are distinguished only by their relations of origin, not by essence.
    - All divine attributes are fully possessed by each person.
    - "The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are of one and the same substance or essence." (De Trinitate I.4)

2. **Inseparable Operations**
    - All external works of God are performed by the Trinity as a whole.
    - No person acts independently in the **economy** of salvation.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit reflect their eternal relations but are not divided acts.
    - This principle anticipates the later formulation of Rahner’s Rule.
    - "The works of the Trinity are inseparable." (De Trinitate II.2)

3. **Distinction of Persons by Relations**
    - The **Father** is unbegotten, the **Son** is begotten, and the **Spirit** proceeds.
    - These relations are internal to the divine life and ground the distinction of persons.
    - The relations do not imply subordination or inequality.
    - The economic missions reveal but do not create these distinctions.
    - "These three are one, not one person, but one substance." (De Trinitate VII.6)

4. **Economic Revelation of the Trinity**
    - The **Trinity** is revealed in the history of salvation, especially in the missions of the Son and Spirit.
    - The economic actions of God reflect the eternal relations within the Godhead.
    - There is a real correspondence between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**, though not identity.
    - The visible missions serve to reveal the invisible God.
    - "The sending of the Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit are the revelation of their eternal processions." (De Trinitate II.9)

5. **Analogical Knowledge of God**
    - Human language about God is always analogical, not univocal.
    - The mystery of the Trinity surpasses human comprehension.
    - Analogies (such as memory, understanding, and will) help but do not exhaust the reality of the Trinity.
    - This humility before mystery shapes later trinitarian reflection, including Barth’s caution.
    - "If you comprehend it, it is not God." (Sermon 117)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s trinitarian theology profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, providing the conceptual framework for later discussions of the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**. His emphasis on the unity of divine action and the inseparability of the persons became foundational for both **Rahner’s Rule** and Barth’s reformulation, even as later theologians nuanced or critiqued his approach. Augustine’s influence endures in both Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions, ensuring that his insights remain central to systematic theology.
