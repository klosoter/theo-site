# Kevin Vanhoozer (1957–)

Kevin Vanhoozer engages **Rahner’s Rule**—that the "economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa"—by critically appropriating and extending **Barth’s reformulation** within a robustly **theodramatic** and **hermeneutical** framework. He affirms the inseparability of the **immanent** and **economic Trinity** while emphasizing the communicative action of God in Scripture, thus safeguarding both divine transcendence and the reality of God’s self-revelation in history.

- "God is who he is in the history of his communicative action, yet he is not reducible to that history." (Remythologizing Theology)

## Key Works

- Remythologizing Theology: Divine Action, Passion, and Authorship (2010)
- The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical-Linguistic Approach to Christian Theology (2005)
- First Theology: God, Scripture & Hermeneutics (2002)
- "The Love of God: Its Place, Meaning and Function in Systematic Theology" (in The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine, 1997)
- "The Trinity" (in The Cambridge Companion to Postmodern Theology, 2003)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Being-in-Communicative-Act**
   - God’s identity is revealed through his **communicative action** in salvation history.
   - The **immanent Trinity** is not collapsed into the **economic Trinity**, but is genuinely disclosed through it.
   - Divine self-communication is both personal and covenantal, not merely informational.
   - The drama of redemption is the arena in which God’s triune identity is enacted and known.
   - "God is the one whose being is in communicating himself." (Remythologizing Theology)

2. **Critical Reception of Rahner’s Rule**
   - Affirms the basic insight that God’s self-revelation is trustworthy and corresponds to who God is.
   - Warns against reducing God’s eternal being to his historical actions (avoiding historicism).
   - Stresses the need for **theological realism**: God is truly revealed, yet remains free and transcendent.
   - Sees the rule as a hermeneutical guide, not a metaphysical equation.
   - "Rahner’s Rule is a necessary but not sufficient condition for trinitarian theology." (Remythologizing Theology)

3. **Barth’s Reformulation and Its Limits**
   - Appreciates Barth’s insistence that God is subject, not object, in revelation.
   - Follows Barth in distinguishing, yet relating, the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.
   - Critiques Barth for sometimes veering toward modalism or insufficiently distinguishing the divine persons.
   - Argues for a more dialogical and dramatic model of God’s self-presentation.
   - "Barth’s reformulation rightly guards God’s freedom, but must be complemented by a robust account of divine communicative action." (Remythologizing Theology)

4. **Theodramatic Hermeneutics**
   - Scripture is the script of God’s communicative action, revealing the triune God in history.
   - The church participates in the ongoing drama, discerning God’s identity through canonical interpretation.
   - The **economic Trinity** is the stage on which the immanent Trinity is made known.
   - Theological method must be attentive to both the drama (history) and the author (God).
   - "The economy is the drama in which the triune God makes himself known as author, actor, and director." (The Drama of Doctrine)

5. **Safeguarding Divine Transcendence and Immanence**
   - God is genuinely present and active in history, yet remains ontologically distinct from creation.
   - The **immanent Trinity** grounds the reality and reliability of God’s actions in the economy.
   - Avoids both historicism (God reduced to history) and abstraction (God detached from history).
   - The rule serves to balance God’s freedom and faithfulness in self-revelation.
   - "God is not simply what he does, but he does what he is." (Remythologizing Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vanhoozer’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **Trinitarian theology**, especially regarding the relationship between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**. His theodramatic and communicative approach offers a nuanced alternative to both classical and revisionist models, influencing evangelical and Reformed theologians. By critically engaging both Rahner and Barth, Vanhoozer has advanced a hermeneutically sensitive, canonically grounded account of God’s triune self-revelation that continues to inform systematic theology and theological method.
