# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards offer a classic and enduring articulation of **Trinitarian theology**, emphasizing both the **unity and distinction** within the Godhead and the relationship between the **immanent and economic Trinity**. They provide foundational categories for understanding how God’s actions in history reveal, but do not exhaust, His eternal being, shaping later Reformed reflection on the doctrine of the Trinity.

- "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost." (Westminster Confession of Faith II.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, especially Chapters II ("Of God, and of the Holy Trinity") and VIII ("Of Christ the Mediator")
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 6–11 (on the Trinity and the persons of the Godhead)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 4–6
- The Westminster Assembly’s debates and minutes (as collected in Chad Van Dixhoorn, ed., "The Minutes and Papers of the Westminster Assembly, 1643–1652")
- Robert Letham, "The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction and Unity in the Trinity**
    - Affirms the **one essence** and **three persons** of the Godhead.
    - Each person is fully and equally God, without division of substance.
    - The distinctions among persons are not merely functional or economic, but eternal.
    - The **personal properties** (paternity, filiation, procession) are intrinsic to each person.
    "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity." (WCF II.3)

2. **Immanent and Economic Trinity**
    - Distinguishes between God’s eternal being and His works in history.
    - God’s actions in **creation and redemption** reveal but do not exhaust His inner life.
    - The **missions** of the Son and Spirit are grounded in their eternal relations.
    - There is no change in God’s being as He acts ad extra.
    "God is without...passions, immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible..." (WCF II.1)

3. **Revelation of the Trinity in Redemption**
    - The Trinity is most clearly revealed in the **work of redemption**.
    - The Father ordains, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies redemption.
    - The economic roles reflect, but do not collapse into, the eternal distinctions.
    - The **mediatorial work of Christ** is rooted in His eternal Sonship.
    "It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus...to be the Mediator." (WCF VIII.1)

4. **Safeguarding Divine Mystery**
    - Stresses the **incomprehensibility** of God’s essence.
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal.
    - The **Trinity** is a revealed mystery, not accessible by reason alone.
    - The economic revelation is true, but does not exhaust the divine reality.
    "The doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable dependence on Him." (WLC Q.5)

5. **Rejection of Modalism and Subordinationism**
    - Explicitly rejects any confusion of persons (modalism).
    - Denies any subordination of essence among the persons.
    - The **Son and Spirit** are not lesser than the Father in being or glory.
    - The distinctions are of relation, not of substance or rank.
    "The Son is eternally begotten of the Father, the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son." (WCF II.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed Trinitarian theology**, providing categories that anticipate and inform later discussions such as Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation. Their careful distinction between the **immanent and economic Trinity** safeguards both the unity and mystery of God, influencing subsequent confessional and systematic formulations. The Standards’ articulation of the Trinity remains a touchstone for evaluating modern developments in Trinitarian thought.
