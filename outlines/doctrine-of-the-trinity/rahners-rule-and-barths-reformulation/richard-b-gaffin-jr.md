# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. engages **Rahner’s Rule**—the axiom that the "economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa"—by critically assessing its implications for **Reformed trinitarian theology** and its reformulation in the work of **Karl Barth**. Gaffin emphasizes the necessity of maintaining the **ontological distinction** between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity** while affirming the inseparable operations of the triune God in **redemptive history**.

- "The economic Trinity reveals the immanent Trinity, but does not exhaust it." (Gaffin, "The Trinity, the Holy Spirit, and Our Adoption")

## Key Works

- "The Trinity, the Holy Spirit, and Our Adoption" in *The Practical Calvinist: Essays in Honor of John L. Carson*
- *Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit*
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Tradition" in *Westminster Theological Journal*
- *By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation*
- "Union with Christ: Some Biblical and Theological Reflections" in *Always Reforming: Explorations in Systematic Theology*

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Immanent and Economic Trinity**
   - Affirms the **ontological distinction** between God's eternal being and His actions in history.
   - Warns against collapsing the **immanent Trinity** into the **economic Trinity**.
   - Recognizes the necessity of revelation for knowledge of God, but not its exhaustiveness.
   - Maintains that God's inner life is not fully disclosed in redemptive acts.
   - "The economic Trinity is truly revelatory, but not exhaustive of the immanent Trinity." ("The Trinity, the Holy Spirit, and Our Adoption")

2. **Critical Engagement with Rahner’s Rule**
   - Acknowledges the value of Rahner’s Rule in emphasizing God’s self-revelation.
   - Critiques its tendency to blur the Creator-creature distinction.
   - Insists on the **asymmetry** between revelation and divine essence.
   - Sees the rule as a caution, not a comprehensive theological principle.
   - "Rahner’s Rule must be handled with care lest it undermine the transcendence of God." ("The Trinity, the Holy Spirit, and Our Adoption")

3. **Barth’s Reformulation and Its Limits**
   - Recognizes Barth’s attempt to safeguard the unity of God’s being and act.
   - Notes Barth’s emphasis on revelation as the locus of trinitarian knowledge.
   - Critiques Barth for insufficiently upholding the **ontological priority** of the immanent Trinity.
   - Argues that Barth’s approach risks historicizing God’s being.
   - "Barth’s reformulation, while corrective in some respects, does not fully preserve the ontological distinction necessary for Reformed theology." ("Biblical Theology and the Westminster Tradition")

4. **Revelation and Redemptive History**
   - Stresses that God’s self-disclosure is always through **redemptive history**.
   - Upholds the unity of the **economic Trinity** in the work of salvation.
   - Maintains that revelation is accommodated to human capacity.
   - Affirms that the **Spirit’s work** is central to understanding the Trinity in history.
   - "The triune God is known in and through his redemptive acts, but these acts do not exhaust his being." ("The Trinity, the Holy Spirit, and Our Adoption")

5. **Faithfulness to Reformed Confessional Standards**
   - Grounds trinitarian theology in the **Westminster Standards**.
   - Insists on the **incomprehensibility of God** as foundational.
   - Sees confessional boundaries as safeguards against speculative trinitarianism.
   - Emphasizes the regulative role of Scripture in trinitarian formulation.
   - "The Westminster Confession’s doctrine of God provides the necessary parameters for engaging Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s proposals." ("Biblical Theology and the Westminster Tradition")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s careful engagement with **Rahner’s Rule** and Barth’s reformulation has reinforced the importance of the **ontological distinction** between the immanent and economic Trinity within Reformed theology. His work has shaped contemporary discussions on the relationship between **revelation** and the **being of God**, especially in the context of redemptive history. By grounding his analysis in the **Westminster Confession**, Gaffin has provided a confessional framework for navigating modern trinitarian debates, ensuring that the transcendence and incomprehensibility of God remain central in systematic theology.
