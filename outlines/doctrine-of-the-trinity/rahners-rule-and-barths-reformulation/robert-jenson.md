# Robert Jenson (1930–2017)

Robert Jenson engaged deeply with **Rahner’s Rule**—that the "economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa"—and **Barth’s reformulation** of Trinitarian theology. Jenson affirmed the inseparability of the **economic** and **immanent Trinity**, but pressed further by emphasizing the **narrative identity** of God and the centrality of **Christ’s history** as constitutive of God’s being. His approach sought to move beyond both Rahner and Barth by rooting **Trinitarian identity** in the drama of salvation history.

- "The identities of the immanent and economic Trinity are not merely parallel but are one and the same, constituted in the history of Jesus." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1: The Triune God (1997)
- The Triune Identity: God According to the Gospel (1982)
- “The Trinity in Karl Barth and Karl Rahner” (in Theological Investigations, 1965)
- “Rahner and Barth on the Trinity” (Dialog, 1966)
- Canon and Creed (2010)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Narrative Ontology of God**
   - God’s being is constituted by the **story of Jesus** and the Spirit.
   - The **Trinitarian identity** is inseparable from the narrative of salvation history.
   - Rejects any abstract, timeless essence of God apart from God’s acts.
   - The **immanent Trinity** is not hidden behind the economic but revealed in it.
   - "God is whoever raised Jesus from the dead, having before raised Israel from Egypt." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Radicalization of Rahner’s Rule**
   - Affirms Rahner’s insight but insists on a more robust identification.
   - The **economic Trinity** is not merely a reflection but the very reality of the **immanent Trinity**.
   - God’s eternal being is shaped by the history of Jesus and the Spirit.
   - The distinction between the two is not ontological but logical.
   - "The immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity, and there is no God behind the gospel’s God." (The Triune Identity)

3. **Barth’s Christocentric Revision**
   - Appreciates Barth’s focus on **revelation** and **Christology**.
   - Critiques Barth for insufficiently integrating the Spirit and the narrative dimension.
   - Sees Barth’s reformulation as a necessary corrective to classical metaphysics.
   - Argues for a more dynamic, history-shaped doctrine of God.
   - "Barth’s reformulation must be pressed to its narrative conclusion: God’s being is event." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Trinitarian Personhood as Event**
   - The **persons** of the Trinity are constituted by their mutual relations in the divine narrative.
   - Rejects static substance metaphysics in favor of relational ontology.
   - The Father, Son, and Spirit are identified by their roles in the gospel story.
   - The unity of God is the unity of the divine drama.
   - "The persons are the identities enacted in the story of Jesus and his Spirit." (The Triune Identity)

5. **Ecclesial and Eschatological Orientation**
   - The church participates in the ongoing narrative of the Triune God.
   - Eschatology is intrinsic to God’s identity, not an external addendum.
   - The **Trinity** is the horizon of Christian hope and communal life.
   - The future of God’s people is bound up with the future of God himself.
   - "The church’s life is the continuation of the triune narrative, awaiting its eschatological fulfillment." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Jenson’s work on **Rahner’s Rule** and **Barth’s reformulation** has significantly shaped contemporary **Trinitarian theology**, especially in its narrative and relational emphases. His insistence that the **economic Trinity** is constitutive of the **immanent Trinity** has influenced both Protestant and Catholic theologians seeking to overcome classical metaphysical dualisms. Jenson’s narrative approach continues to provoke constructive engagement with the doctrine of God, especially regarding the relationship between history, revelation, and divine identity.
