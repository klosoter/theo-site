# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner engaged deeply with the relationship between the **economic Trinity** and the **immanent Trinity**, critiquing both **Karl Rahner’s Rule** and **Karl Barth’s** reformulation from his own **dialectical theology** perspective. Brunner emphasized the **personal encounter** with God in revelation, maintaining a distinction between God’s self-disclosure in history and God’s eternal being, while resisting any collapse of the two. He argued that while God is truly revealed in the economy, the fullness of the divine mystery remains transcendent.

- "God reveals Himself, but He does not reveal Himself entirely; He remains the Wholly Other." (The Mediator)

## Key Works

- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Dogmatics, Vol. I: The Christian Doctrine of God
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Personal Encounter**
    - Revelation is not mere communication of information but a personal meeting between God and humanity.
    - The **economic Trinity** is the sphere where God addresses humanity, but this does not exhaust God’s being.
    - Brunner insists on the **event-character** of revelation, emphasizing existential response.
    - The distinction between God’s revelation and God’s essence is maintained to safeguard divine freedom.
    - "Revelation is always an event, not a thing." (Revelation and Reason)

2. **God’s Transcendence and Immanence**
    - Brunner stresses the **Wholly Other** nature of God, who remains beyond human comprehension even in revelation.
    - He critiques any identification of the **immanent Trinity** with the **economic Trinity** as risking reductionism.
    - God’s immanence is real in revelation, but never at the expense of His transcendence.
    - The mystery of God persists even as He makes Himself known.
    - "God is never at our disposal, even in His revelation." (The Mediator)

3. **Critique of Rahner’s Rule**
    - Brunner is wary of Rahner’s assertion that the "economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa."
    - He fears this rule blurs the necessary distinction between God’s eternal being and historical self-revelation.
    - For Brunner, revelation is analogical, not univocal; God’s being surpasses His acts in history.
    - He upholds the **analogia fidei** to protect divine mystery.
    - "The God who acts in history is truly God, but not the whole of God." (Dogmatics I)

4. **Engagement with Barth’s Reformulation**
    - Brunner appreciates Barth’s emphasis on revelation but critiques Barth’s tendency to identify God’s being too closely with His self-revelation.
    - He argues that Barth’s reformulation risks collapsing the distinction between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.
    - Brunner insists on a dialectical tension between God’s hiddenness and revelation.
    - The divine mystery is not dissolved in the act of revelation.
    - "We must not confuse God’s act with God’s being." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Safeguarding Divine Freedom**
    - Brunner maintains that God’s freedom is preserved only if the distinction between God’s eternal being and historical revelation is upheld.
    - He warns against any theological system that would make God’s being dependent on His acts ad extra.
    - Divine freedom ensures that revelation is always a gift, never a necessity.
    - The **Trinitarian mystery** is ultimately grounded in God’s sovereign self-determination.
    - "God is free to reveal Himself, and free to remain hidden." (Truth as Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s nuanced approach to the **Trinity** and revelation influenced 20th-century debates on the relationship between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**, especially in dialogue with Barth and Rahner. His insistence on the **dialectical tension** between God’s self-revelation and God’s mystery has shaped modern Protestant theology’s approach to divine transcendence. Brunner’s work remains a significant counterpoint to both Rahner’s and Barth’s positions, ensuring that the **freedom and mystery of God** are not lost in attempts to articulate the doctrine of the Trinity.
