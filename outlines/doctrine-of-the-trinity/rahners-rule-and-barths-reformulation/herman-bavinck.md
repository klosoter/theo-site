# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck’s theology, while preceding the explicit formulation of **Rahner’s Rule** (“the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa”), anticipates and interacts with similar concerns regarding the relationship between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**. Bavinck insists on the unity and self-revelation of the **Triune God** in history, yet maintains a careful distinction between God’s eternal being and his acts in **revelation**. His approach provides a nuanced alternative to both Rahner’s identification and Barth’s reformulation, emphasizing the mystery and sovereignty of God’s inner life.

- "The revelation of God in time is the self-revelation of the eternal God himself." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation
- "The Doctrine of God" (in various essays and lectures)
- "The Catholicity of Christianity and the Church" (essay)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction and Unity of Immanent and Economic Trinity**
    - Maintains a real distinction between **God’s eternal being** and his historical revelation.
    - Asserts that God truly reveals himself, not merely effects or appearances.
    - Rejects any collapse of the immanent into the economic, preserving divine mystery.
    - Affirms that revelation is genuinely of the Triune God, not a lesser manifestation.
    - "God does not become triune in revelation; he is eternally triune." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Revelation as Self-Disclosure**
    - God’s acts in history are a true self-disclosure, not mere accommodation.
    - Revelation is both personal and propositional, rooted in God’s own being.
    - The economic Trinity is grounded in the immanent Trinity, not vice versa.
    - The fullness of God’s being is never exhausted by his revelation.
    - "In revelation, God communicates himself and not merely something about himself." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Mystery and Incomprehensibility of God**
    - God remains incomprehensible even in his self-revelation.
    - Human knowledge of God is analogical, never univocal or exhaustive.
    - The distinction between immanent and economic Trinity safeguards divine transcendence.
    - Mystery is not a defect but a necessary aspect of true knowledge of God.
    - "All our knowledge of God is derived from his revelation, yet God remains infinitely exalted above all his works." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

4. **Trinitarian Economy Rooted in Eternal Relations**
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit reflect their eternal processions.
    - The economic roles of the persons are grounded in their immanent relations.
    - There is no contradiction between God’s eternal life and his temporal actions.
    - The order of revelation mirrors, but does not determine, the order of being.
    - "The Trinity reveals itself in the economy, but the economy presupposes the Trinity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

5. **Safeguarding Divine Freedom and Sovereignty**
    - God’s revelation is a free act, not a necessity imposed by creation or history.
    - The immanent Trinity is not conditioned by the economic Trinity.
    - God’s freedom ensures that revelation is a gift, not an ontological requirement.
    - The distinction upholds the Creator-creature distinction central to Reformed theology.
    - "God is not dependent on the world for his being or his triune existence." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s careful articulation of the relationship between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity** has profoundly influenced Reformed dogmatics, providing a robust alternative to both Rahner’s identification and Barth’s dynamic reformulation. His emphasis on the mystery, freedom, and unity of the Triune God continues to shape contemporary discussions on **Trinitarian theology**. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold both the reality of God’s self-revelation and the transcendence of his eternal being.
