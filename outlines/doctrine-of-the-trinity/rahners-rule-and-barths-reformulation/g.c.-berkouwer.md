# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer engaged deeply with **Rahner’s Rule** (“the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa”) and **Barth’s reformulation** of Trinitarian theology, critically assessing their implications for the doctrine of **God** and the relationship between **revelation** and **ontology**. Berkouwer emphasized the importance of maintaining the mystery of the **Trinity** while upholding the distinction between God’s **immanent** and **economic** being, cautioning against collapsing the two or rendering the divine mystery inaccessible.

- "The distinction between the immanent and economic Trinity must not be so pressed that it threatens the reality of revelation, nor so blurred that it dissolves the mystery of God’s being." (The Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God (De Leer der God)
- The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth
- Studies in Dogmatics: The Trinity
- A Half Century of Theology: Movements and Motives

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Critical Reception of Rahner’s Rule**
    - Recognizes Rahner’s intent to safeguard the reality of **revelation**.
    - Warns against equating the **economic** and **immanent Trinity** without remainder.
    - Stresses the ongoing **mystery** of God’s inner life.
    - Argues that revelation is truly of God, yet does not exhaust God’s being.
    - "Rahner’s Rule rightly emphasizes revelation, but we must not lose the distinction that preserves the transcendence of God." (The Doctrine of God)

2. **Engagement with Barth’s Reformulation**
    - Appreciates Barth’s focus on the **self-revelation** of God in Christ.
    - Notes Barth’s tendency to identify God’s being with His act.
    - Questions whether Barth’s approach risks modalism or historicism.
    - Sees value in Barth’s challenge to static conceptions of the Trinity.
    - "Barth’s reformulation brings the Trinity into the heart of revelation, but we must ask whether it leaves room for the fullness of God’s mystery." (The Triumph of Grace)

3. **Preservation of the Mystery of the Trinity**
    - Insists that **theology** must respect the incomprehensibility of God.
    - Warns against rationalizing or fully systematizing the Trinity.
    - Maintains that revelation is genuine but not exhaustive.
    - Sees the distinction between **immanent** and **economic** as necessary for worship.
    - "The mystery of the Trinity is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be confessed." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **Revelation and Ontology**
    - Affirms that God’s **revelation** is truly of Himself.
    - Rejects the idea that revelation is merely a reflection or accommodation.
    - Maintains that God’s being is not reducible to His acts in history.
    - Sees the need for a careful balance between **revelation** and **ontology**.
    - "Revelation is the self-disclosure of God, but it does not exhaust the depths of His being." (Studies in Dogmatics: The Trinity)

5. **Dogmatic Humility and Theological Method**
    - Advocates for humility in approaching the doctrine of God.
    - Encourages openness to the limits of human understanding.
    - Critiques speculative or overly confident theological systems.
    - Emphasizes the importance of **Scripture** as the norm for Trinitarian reflection.
    - "Dogmatics must always be aware of its own limits before the mystery of God." (A Half Century of Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced engagement with **Rahner’s Rule** and **Barth’s reformulation** has shaped Reformed discussions of the Trinity, especially regarding the relationship between **revelation** and the being of God. His insistence on preserving the **mystery** and transcendence of God has influenced subsequent theologians wary of collapsing the immanent and economic Trinity. Berkouwer’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a balanced, biblically grounded approach to Trinitarian theology in dialogue with modern developments.
