# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s theology of the **Trinity** and **revelation** laid foundational groundwork for later discussions such as **Rahner’s Rule** (“the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa”) and **Barth’s reformulation** of the relationship between God’s being and God’s acts. Calvin emphasized the unity of the **divine essence** and the distinctness of the **persons** as revealed in **redemptive history**, insisting that God is truly known only as He reveals Himself in Christ and by the Spirit. While Calvin does not articulate Rahner’s Rule directly, his insistence on the inseparability of God’s being and works in **revelation** anticipates later debates.

- "For God in himself, as he is invisible to us, so he is incomprehensible; and his works are accordingly a sort of visible representation of him." (Institutes I.5.1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Divine Essence and Distinction of Persons**
    - God’s **essence** is one, yet subsists in three distinct **persons**: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - The persons are distinguished by **relations of origin**, not by essence or attributes.
    - The **Trinity** is not an abstract doctrine but is revealed in the economy of salvation.
    - The unity and distinction are both necessary for true knowledge of God.
    - "We, indeed, distinctly profess that we worship one God, in whom we believe there are three persons." (Institutes I.13.2)

2. **Revelation is Economically Mediated**
    - God is known only as He reveals Himself in **creation** and **redemption**.
    - The **Son** is the mediator of all revelation, making the invisible God known.
    - The **Spirit** enables believers to apprehend God’s self-disclosure.
    - There is no access to the **immanent Trinity** apart from the **economic Trinity**.
    - "God, in so far as he is incomprehensible, is revealed to us in his works." (Institutes I.5.9)

3. **Christocentric Knowledge of God**
    - True knowledge of God is found in **Jesus Christ**, the eternal Son incarnate.
    - Christ is the “mirror” of the invisible God, making the Father known.
    - The **economic mission** of the Son reveals the eternal relationship within the Godhead.
    - The **mediatorial work** of Christ is central to understanding both God’s being and acts.
    - "In Christ, God shows us his righteousness, goodness, wisdom, power, in short, his entire self." (Institutes II.6.1)

4. **Scripture as the Norm of Trinitarian Revelation**
    - **Scripture** is the authoritative witness to God’s triune self-revelation.
    - The doctrine of the Trinity is drawn from the pattern of biblical revelation, not speculative reason.
    - The **Word** and **Spirit** together authenticate true knowledge of God.
    - The **economic acts** of God in history are interpreted by the scriptural witness.
    - "Scripture, gathering up the experience of the ages, distinctly declares that there is but one God." (Institutes I.13.2)

5. **Guarding Against Speculation**
    - Calvin warns against separating God’s being from His acts in history.
    - He rejects speculative attempts to penetrate the **immanent Trinity** apart from revelation.
    - The **mystery** of God’s inner life is to be honored, not unraveled by human reason.
    - The **economic Trinity** is the only legitimate ground for theological reflection.
    - "Let us not be led to seek for God anywhere but in his sacred Word, and let us not think of him otherwise than as his Word teaches us." (Institutes I.13.21)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust articulation of the **Trinity** and his insistence on the unity of God’s being and acts in revelation provided a framework that later theologians, including Barth and Rahner, would engage and reformulate. His emphasis on the **inseparability of the economic and immanent Trinity** anticipated modern debates on how God’s self-disclosure relates to God’s eternal being. Calvin’s scripturally grounded approach continues to shape Reformed theology’s engagement with questions of **revelation**, **Trinitarian doctrine**, and the limits of theological speculation.
