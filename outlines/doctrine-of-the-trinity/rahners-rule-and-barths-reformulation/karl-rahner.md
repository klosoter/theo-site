# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner is renowned for articulating what has become known as **Rahner’s Rule**: "the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa." This principle asserts a profound unity between God's **self-revelation in salvation history** and God's **eternal triune being**, challenging any strict separation between the **economic** and **immanent Trinity**. Rahner’s approach has deeply influenced modern **Trinitarian theology**, emphasizing that our knowledge of God’s inner life is inseparable from God’s actions in the world.

- "The 'economic' Trinity is the 'immanent' Trinity and the 'immanent' Trinity is the 'economic' Trinity." ("The Trinity," 1986)

## Key Works

- "The Trinity" (Grundkurs des Glaubens, 1976; English trans. 1986)
- "Foundations of Christian Faith" (Grundkurs des Glaubens, 1976)
- "Theological Investigations," Volumes I–IV
- "Hearer of the Word" (1941)
- "Spirit in the World" (1939)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Economic and Immanent Trinity**
    - Rejects any dualism between God's actions in history and God's eternal being.
    - Asserts that the **self-communication of God** in salvation history truly reveals God's inner life.
    - Maintains that the **economic Trinity** is not merely a reflection or mask of the **immanent Trinity**.
    - Insists that the doctrine of the Trinity must be rooted in **revelation** rather than speculative metaphysics.
    - "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity." ("The Trinity")

2. **Primacy of Revelation in Trinitarian Theology**
    - Argues that all knowledge of the Trinity comes through God's **self-revelation** in Christ and the Spirit.
    - Opposes approaches that prioritize philosophical speculation over biblical revelation.
    - Emphasizes the **historical manifestation** of God as constitutive for understanding the Trinity.
    - Sees **revelation** as both the source and norm for Trinitarian doctrine.
    - "We know nothing about the Trinity of God except what has been revealed in the economy of salvation." ("The Trinity")

3. **Anthropological Orientation**
    - Frames theology in terms of the **human experience of God’s self-communication**.
    - Highlights the role of the **transcendental subject** as the "hearer of the Word."
    - Connects the doctrine of the Trinity to the existential openness of humans to God.
    - Sees the **Trinity** as the ground of the possibility of human knowledge of God.
    - "Man is the being who hears the Word of God." ("Hearer of the Word")

4. **Critique of Trinitarian Speculation**
    - Criticizes traditional Trinitarian theology for being overly abstract and disconnected from salvation history.
    - Warns against treating the **immanent Trinity** as a speculative doctrine with little relevance to faith.
    - Calls for a return to the **biblical witness** as the foundation for Trinitarian reflection.
    - Sees the **doctrine of the Trinity** as meaningful only insofar as it relates to God's saving work.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity has almost no relevance in the actual life of Christians." ("The Trinity")

5. **Self-Communication of God**
    - Centralizes the idea that God gives Godself to humanity in history.
    - Identifies the **incarnation** and **sending of the Spirit** as the means of God’s self-communication.
    - Argues that the **Trinity** is not a hidden reality but is made manifest in God’s actions.
    - Views the **self-giving of God** as the basis for understanding both the economic and immanent Trinity.
    - "God’s self-communication is the ground of the doctrine of the Trinity." ("Foundations of Christian Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s **Rahner’s Rule** has become a foundational axiom in contemporary Trinitarian theology, shaping the way theologians approach the relationship between God’s eternal being and historical revelation. His insistence on the unity of the **economic** and **immanent Trinity** has influenced both Catholic and Protestant thought, prompting renewed engagement with the doctrine of the Trinity in light of **revelation** and **salvation history**. Rahner’s work continues to provoke discussion and critique, especially regarding the implications of his anthropological orientation and his challenge to speculative theology. His legacy endures in the ongoing quest to articulate a Trinitarian theology that is both faithful to revelation and meaningful for the life of the church.
