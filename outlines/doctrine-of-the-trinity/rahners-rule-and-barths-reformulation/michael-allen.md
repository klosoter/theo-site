# Michael Allen (1979–)

Michael Allen is a contemporary Reformed theologian who has engaged deeply with **Rahner’s Rule**—the axiom that the "economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa"—and its **reformulation** by **Karl Barth**. Allen critically appropriates these discussions, emphasizing the importance of **divine self-revelation**, the **inseparability of God’s being and acts**, and the need to safeguard both **Trinitarian doctrine** and the **Creator-creature distinction** within a classical Reformed framework.

- "Rahner’s Rule rightly underscores the unity of God’s being and action, but it must be received within the grammar of classical theism and the Creator-creature distinction." (Allen, "The Ground of Union")

## Key Works

- "The Ground of Union: Deification in Aquinas and Calvin" (2011)
- "Reformed Catholicity: The Promise of Retrieval for Theology and Biblical Interpretation" (with Scott R. Swain, 2015)
- "Theological Commentary: Evangelical Perspectives" (2011)
- "Sanctification" (2017)
- "The Identity and Attributes of God" (2018)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Reception of Rahner’s Rule within Classical Theism**
    - Affirms the value of Rahner’s Rule for articulating the unity of **God’s being and acts**.
    - Insists that the rule must be interpreted within the **Creator-creature distinction**.
    - Warns against collapsing **immanent** and **economic Trinity** in a way that undermines divine transcendence.
    - Advocates for a retrieval of **patristic and scholastic categories** to clarify Trinitarian grammar.
    - "The economic Trinity reveals the immanent Trinity, but does not exhaust it." ("The Ground of Union")

2. **Critical Engagement with Barth’s Reformulation**
    - Recognizes Barth’s emphasis on **God’s self-revelation** as a corrective to modern historicism.
    - Appreciates Barth’s concern to avoid speculation about God apart from revelation.
    - Critiques Barth for potentially blurring the distinction between **God’s eternal being** and **temporal acts**.
    - Argues for a more robust account of **divine aseity** and **immutability** than Barth sometimes allows.
    - "Barth’s reformulation is a salutary warning against natural theology, but must be balanced by classical commitments." ("Reformed Catholicity")

3. **Safeguarding the Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - Stresses that **God’s inner life** remains qualitatively distinct from creation.
    - Maintains that revelation is truly of God, but not exhaustive of God’s essence.
    - Upholds the **analogy of being** as a necessary tool for theological discourse.
    - Rejects any identification of God’s being with the history of salvation.
    - "The distinction between Creator and creature is not erased by God’s self-giving in Christ." ("The Identity and Attributes of God")

4. **Doctrine of Revelation and Divine Freedom**
    - Asserts that God freely chooses to reveal himself in the economy.
    - Emphasizes that **revelation** is a gracious act, not a necessity of God’s nature.
    - Insists that God’s freedom is preserved when the immanent Trinity is not collapsed into the economic.
    - Argues that the **Word made flesh** is the supreme but not the sole form of God’s self-disclosure.
    - "God is not bound to reveal himself, but does so out of sheer grace." ("Sanctification")

5. **Retrieval for Contemporary Trinitarian Theology**
    - Calls for a ressourcement of **patristic and Reformed sources** to clarify Rahner’s Rule.
    - Encourages careful use of **doctrinal development** to avoid modern reductionism.
    - Sees value in ecumenical dialogue for refining Trinitarian language.
    - Advocates for a theology that is both **biblically rooted** and **dogmatically precise**.
    - "Retrieval is necessary if we are to speak rightly of the Trinity in light of Rahner and Barth." ("Reformed Catholicity")

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Allen’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions of **Trinitarian theology** by critically engaging Rahner’s Rule and Barth’s reformulation from a Reformed and classical perspective. His emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the retrieval of classical categories has influenced a new generation of theologians seeking to balance doctrinal fidelity with ecumenical openness. Allen’s contributions continue to foster rigorous dialogue about the relationship between God’s being and acts, ensuring that the unity and distinction within the Trinity remain central to systematic theology.
