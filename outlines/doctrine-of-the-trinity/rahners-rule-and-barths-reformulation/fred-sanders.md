# Fred Sanders (1968–)

Fred Sanders is a contemporary evangelical theologian whose work on the **doctrine of the Trinity** engages deeply with **Rahner’s Rule**—the assertion that the "economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa"—and **Barth’s reformulation** of trinitarian theology. Sanders affirms the importance of the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity in salvation history while insisting on the **distinction between God’s eternal life and His actions in history**, thus offering a nuanced reading of both Rahner and Barth within a robustly orthodox framework.

- "The Trinity is not a footnote to the gospel; it is the gospel." (The Deep Things of God)

    - Warns against collapsing the **immanent Trinity** into the **economic**.
    - Argues that God’s eternal triune life is not reducible to His actions in salvation history.
    - Maintains that revelation is truly of God Himself, not merely of His works.
    - "The economic Trinity truly reveals the immanent Trinity, but does not exhaust it." (The Deep Things of God)

2. **Barth’s Reformulation and Its Limits**
    - Appreciates Barth’s focus on **revelation** as the basis for trinitarian knowledge.
    - Critiques Barth’s tendency to identify God’s being too closely with His acts.
    - Insists on the **aseity** and **immutability** of God apart from creation.
    - Sees Barth’s reformulation as a corrective but not a replacement for classical doctrine.
    - "Barth’s trinitarianism is a powerful retrieval, but it must be anchored in the eternal reality of God." (The Triune God)

3. **Classical Trinitarian Distinctions**
    - Defends the **ontological distinction** between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.
    - Emphasizes the eternal relations of origin within the Godhead.
    - Rejects any form of modalism or historicism in trinitarian doctrine.
    - Affirms the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity in creation and redemption.
    - "The Father, Son, and Spirit are who they are eternally, not just in relation to us." (The Triune God)

4. **Revelation and Participation**
    - Asserts that God’s self-revelation is a genuine participation in the triune life.
    - Maintains that revelation is analogical, not univocal.
    - Stresses the importance of **Scripture** as the normative witness to the Trinity.
    - Encourages doxological response as the proper end of trinitarian theology.
    - "We know the Trinity because God has made Himself known, not because we have reasoned our way up to Him." (The Deep Things of God)

    - Argues that the Trinity is foundational for understanding **salvation** and **worship**.
    - Sees the doctrine as vital for the church’s teaching and spiritual formation.
    - Warns against abstract or speculative trinitarianism disconnected from practice.
    - "The Trinity is the framework within which the entire Christian life is lived." (The Deep Things of God)

## Legacy and Impact

His careful engagement with **Rahner’s Rule** and **Barth’s reformulation** has provided clarity for those seeking to affirm both the unity and distinction of God’s triune life and His works in history. Sanders’s work has influenced pastors, theologians, and students to see the **doctrine of the Trinity** as central to the gospel and the Christian life, shaping both academic discourse and practical ministry.
