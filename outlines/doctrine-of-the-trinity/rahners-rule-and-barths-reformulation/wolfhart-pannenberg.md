# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg critically engaged **Rahner’s Rule**—that the "economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa"—and **Barth’s reformulation** of Trinitarian doctrine, emphasizing the historical self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ as foundational for understanding **Trinitarian ontology**. Pannenberg insisted that the **economic Trinity** must inform our understanding of the **immanent Trinity**, but he also warned against collapsing the eternal being of God into mere historical process, seeking a balance between **revelation** and **divine transcendence**.

- "The revelation of God in history is the basis for all knowledge of God’s being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially chapters on Trinity and revelation)
- Jesus—God and Man
- Revelation as History (ed. with R. W. Funk)
- The Idea of God and Human Freedom
- Theology and the Kingdom of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Basis for Trinitarian Knowledge**
   - God’s being is disclosed in the historical revelation of Jesus Christ.
   - The **economic Trinity** is not merely a reflection but a genuine disclosure of the **immanent Trinity**.
   - Revelation is not just informational but constitutive for understanding God’s identity.
   - The historical process is essential for grasping the fullness of God’s self-communication.
   - "God’s deity is not a static quality but is revealed in his rule over history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Critical Reception of Rahner’s Rule**
   - Affirms Rahner’s insight that the **economic** and **immanent Trinity** are inseparable.
   - Warns against reducing God’s eternal being to historical manifestation alone.
   - Stresses the need for a dialectical relationship between God’s eternal nature and historical revelation.
   - Seeks to avoid modalism by maintaining God’s transcendence alongside immanence.
   - "The immanent Trinity is not simply identical with the economic Trinity, but is truly revealed in it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Engagement with Barth’s Reformulation**
   - Appreciates Barth’s focus on revelation as the ground for Trinitarian doctrine.
   - Critiques Barth for insufficiently distinguishing between God’s eternal being and God’s acts in history.
   - Argues that God’s being is not constituted by revelation but is revealed through it.
   - Emphasizes the need for a robust doctrine of **divine freedom**.
   - "God is not dependent on revelation for his being, but his being is made known in revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Historical Mediation of Divine Selfhood**
   - God’s selfhood is expressed and mediated through historical events, especially in Christ.
   - The resurrection is central for understanding the unity of God’s being and action.
   - The **Trinity** is not a timeless abstraction but is dynamically revealed in salvation history.
   - Human history is the arena for God’s self-revelation and the realization of divine purpose.
   - "The unity of the Trinity is realized in the history of salvation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Ontological Priority of the Future**
   - God’s being is eschatologically oriented; the future is constitutive for divine identity.
   - The fullness of God’s self-revelation awaits eschatological consummation.
   - The **Trinity** is best understood in light of God’s coming kingdom.
   - The openness of history is essential for understanding God’s relationality and freedom.
   - "God’s being is determined by his future, not by a static past." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s nuanced engagement with **Rahner’s Rule** and **Barth’s reformulation** has significantly shaped modern Trinitarian theology, especially in emphasizing the importance of **revelation** and **history** for understanding God’s being. His insistence on the dialectic between the **economic** and **immanent Trinity** has influenced both systematic and constructive theologians. Pannenberg’s work continues to challenge theologians to integrate **eschatology**, **revelation**, and **ontology** in articulating the doctrine of God.
