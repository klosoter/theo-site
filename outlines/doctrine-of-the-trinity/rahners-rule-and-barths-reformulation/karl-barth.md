# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth critically engaged **Rahner’s Rule**—that "the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and vice versa"—by affirming the inseparability of **God’s revelation** in history and the eternal **Trinitarian being** of God, while rigorously maintaining the freedom and sovereignty of God’s self-disclosure. Barth’s reformulation insists that the **immanent Trinity** is known only through the **economic Trinity**, yet God’s inner life is not exhausted by His acts in salvation history, preserving both divine mystery and revelation.

- "The God who reveals Himself is the God who is; and the God who is, is the God who reveals Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Church Dogmatics II/1: The Doctrine of God
- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- "The Doctrine of the Trinity" (in Church Dogmatics I/1)
- Karl Barth: Theologian of Freedom by Eberhard Busch

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as the Basis for Trinitarian Knowledge**
   - God is known only as He reveals Himself in **Jesus Christ** through the **Holy Spirit**.
   - The **economic Trinity** is the sole access point to the **immanent Trinity**.
   - Revelation is a sovereign act of God, not a human discovery.
   - There is no natural knowledge of the Trinity apart from God’s self-revelation.
   - "God is who He is in the act of His revelation, and He reveals Himself as who He is." (CD I/1)

2. **Unity and Distinction in the Trinity**
   - Barth affirms the unity of God’s being and the real distinction of **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit**.
   - The distinctions are grounded in God’s eternal being, not merely in His actions.
   - The **immanent** and **economic Trinity** are inseparable but not identical.
   - The divine persons are revealed in God’s saving acts, yet their distinction is eternal.
   - "The revelation of God is identical with God Himself." (CD I/1)

3. **Critique and Reformulation of Rahner’s Rule**
   - Barth agrees that God’s economic actions reveal who He is, but warns against collapsing God’s being into His acts.
   - He resists any identification that would make God’s inner life dependent on creation or history.
   - The **immanent Trinity** remains free and sovereign, not determined by the economy.
   - God’s self-revelation is true, but does not exhaust the mystery of His being.
   - "God is not a prisoner of His revelation." (CD II/1)

4. **Christocentric Trinitarianism**
   - All knowledge of God, including the Trinity, is mediated through **Jesus Christ**.
   - The incarnation is the definitive act of God’s self-revelation.
   - The Trinity is not an abstract doctrine but is grounded in the history of **salvation**.
   - The person and work of Christ are central to understanding both the economic and immanent Trinity.
   - "In Jesus Christ, God reveals Himself as the triune God." (CD I/1)

5. **Safeguarding Divine Mystery and Freedom**
   - Barth insists on the **mystery** of God’s being, even in revelation.
   - God’s freedom means He is never fully comprehended by His acts in history.
   - The **Trinity** is both revealed and hidden; revelation is real but not exhaustive.
   - The distinction between the economic and immanent Trinity protects the transcendence of God.
   - "God reveals Himself. He reveals Himself through Himself. He reveals Himself." (CD I/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s reformulation of **Rahner’s Rule** has profoundly shaped modern **Trinitarian theology**, especially in its insistence on the inseparability yet distinction of the economic and immanent Trinity. His Christocentric approach and emphasis on revelation have influenced both Protestant and Catholic thought. Barth’s careful balance between divine self-disclosure and the preservation of divine mystery continues to inform contemporary debates on the doctrine of God. His work remains a touchstone for discussions of **Trinitarian ontology** and the relationship between God’s being and acts.
