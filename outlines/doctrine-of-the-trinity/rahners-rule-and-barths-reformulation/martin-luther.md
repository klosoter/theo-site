# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther did not explicitly formulate **Rahner’s Rule** or directly engage with **Barth’s reformulation**, but his theology laid foundational groundwork for later discussions on the relationship between the **humanity and divinity of Christ**. Luther’s emphasis on the **communicatio idiomatum** and the real presence in the **Lord’s Supper** highlighted his conviction that the **divine** is truly and fully present in the **human**. This Christological focus influenced later debates on how the **attributes of God** are manifested in the incarnate Christ.

- "For God is present everywhere, but He does not wish that you grope for Him everywhere. Grope rather where the Word is, and there you will lay hold of Him in the right way." (LW 36:342)

## Key Works

- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- The Small Catechism (1529)
- The Large Catechism (1529)
- Sermons on the Gospel of John (1537–1540)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 37: Word and Sacrament III

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Person**
   - Christ is one person with two natures, **divine and human**, inseparably joined.
   - The **personal union** means the attributes of each nature are truly present in the one Christ.
   - The **communicatio idiomatum** allows for the sharing of attributes between natures.
   - The divine is not diminished or abstracted in the incarnation.
   - "He who is God is also man, and he who is man is also God." (Large Catechism)

2. **Real Presence and the Humanity of Christ**
   - Christ’s body and blood are truly present in the **Eucharist**.
   - The real presence affirms the full participation of Christ’s humanity in divine action.
   - The **finite is capable of the infinite** (finitum capax infiniti) in the sacramental context.
   - This presence is grounded in the union of natures, not in a change of substance.
   - "This is my body, which is given for you." (Small Catechism)

3. **Rejection of Speculative Christology**
   - Luther opposes separating the natures of Christ in abstract speculation.
   - Emphasizes the **concrete reality** of Christ’s work and presence.
   - Theological reflection must be grounded in **Scripture** and the **means of grace**.
   - The mystery of the incarnation is to be adored, not dissected.
   - "Where God builds His church, the devil builds a chapel next door." (Table Talk)

4. **Theology of the Cross**
   - God reveals Himself most fully in the **humiliation** and suffering of Christ.
   - The divine is hidden under the form of the human and the crucified.
   - True knowledge of God comes through the cross, not through abstract speculation.
   - The cross is the locus of God’s self-revelation in Christ.
   - "He who does not know Christ does not know God hidden in suffering." (Heidelberg Disputation)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for Christology**
   - All Christological claims must be rooted in the **witness of Scripture**.
   - The **Word of God** is the means by which Christ is known and encountered.
   - The unity of the Testaments centers on the revelation of Christ.
   - The authority of Christ’s person and work is established by divine revelation.
   - "The Bible is the cradle wherein Christ is laid." (Preface to the Old Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust **Christological realism** profoundly shaped later Protestant theology, especially in debates over the relationship between Christ’s natures. His insistence on the **communicatio idiomatum** and the real presence in the sacraments provided a framework that influenced both Lutheran and Reformed responses to questions later formalized in **Rahner’s Rule** and **Barth’s reformulation**. While Luther did not directly address these modern formulations, his thought remains a crucial antecedent in the ongoing development of **incarnational theology**.
