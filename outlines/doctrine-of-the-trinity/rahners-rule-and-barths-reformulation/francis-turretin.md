# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, did not directly address "Rahner’s Rule" or Barth’s reformulation, but his robust doctrine of **the Trinity** and **Christology** provides essential background for later discussions. Turretin emphasized the **inseparable operations** of the divine persons and the **unity of the divine essence**, which aligns with the concerns underlying Rahner’s Rule (“the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa”) and Barth’s Christological focus. His careful distinctions between **essential** and **personal properties** in God laid groundwork for later theological reflection on the relationship between God’s inner life and His revelation in history.

- "The external works of the Trinity are undivided, although the persons are distinguished by their peculiar modes of operation." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on the Trinity (various loci in Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (as referenced in secondary literature)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Divine Essence**
    - God’s essence is numerically one, shared fully by Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - No division or composition exists within the divine nature.
    - All divine attributes are possessed equally and identically by each person.
    - The unity of essence grounds the unity of divine action ad extra.
    - "The divine essence is not multiplied, but remains one and the same in all the persons." (Institutes)

2. **Distinction of Persons by Incommunicable Properties**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit are distinguished by eternal relations of origin.
    - These distinctions do not divide the essence or introduce subordination.
    - Each person is fully God, yet not the same person as the others.
    - Personal properties are necessary for true Trinitarian confession.
    - "The persons are distinguished not by essence, but by personal properties." (Institutes)

3. **Inseparable Operations (Opera ad extra sunt indivisa)**
    - All external works of God are performed by the whole Trinity.
    - Economic distinctions reflect the order of persons, not division of labor.
    - The missions of Son and Spirit reveal, but do not create, personal distinctions.
    - The unity of action safeguards monotheism and the doctrine of God.
    - "The works of the Trinity toward the world are undivided, though appropriated to each person." (Institutes)

4. **Revelation and Accommodation**
    - God reveals Himself according to our capacity, not in His essence.
    - The economic Trinity is a true revelation, but not exhaustive of the immanent Trinity.
    - Scripture is the norm for all knowledge of God’s triune being and works.
    - Human language about God is analogical, not univocal.
    - "God accommodates himself to our weakness in the revelation of his mysteries." (Institutes)

5. **Christological Mediation**
    - The Son’s incarnation is the unique mode of divine self-revelation.
    - The hypostatic union preserves both divine and human natures without confusion.
    - Christ’s mediatorial work is grounded in the eternal counsel of the Trinity.
    - The economic mission of the Son reflects, but does not exhaust, his eternal sonship.
    - "The Son is sent as mediator according to the decree of the Trinity, not as an inferior being." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s precise distinctions in **Trinitarian theology** shaped the Reformed tradition’s approach to the relationship between God’s eternal being and His historical revelation. His articulation of **inseparable operations** and the unity of essence provided a conceptual foundation for later theological debates, including those addressed by Rahner and Barth. While Turretin did not engage Rahner’s Rule or Barth’s reformulation directly, his work remains a touchstone for discussions of the **economic and immanent Trinity** in classical Reformed thought.
