# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos, as a foundational figure in **Reformed biblical theology**, did not directly engage with **Rahner’s Rule** or **Barth’s reformulation** but provided a robust framework for understanding the relationship between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**. Vos emphasized the **self-revelation of God in redemptive history**, maintaining the unity and distinction within the **Trinitarian economy** without collapsing the ontological distinctions. His approach upholds the integrity of **special revelation** and the **historical unfolding** of God’s redemptive acts.

- "Revelation is the interpretation of redemption; it must, therefore, unfold itself in installments as redemption does." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Special Revelation**
    - God’s **self-disclosure** is historically progressive and climaxes in Christ.
    - Revelation is inseparable from the acts of redemption in history.
    - The **economic Trinity** is revealed through redemptive events, not speculative philosophy.
    - The **immanent Trinity** is known only as God chooses to reveal Himself.
    - "Revelation is the interpretation of redemption." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Distinction and Unity in the Trinity**
    - Maintains a clear distinction between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.
    - The economic Trinity reflects, but does not exhaust, the reality of the immanent Trinity.
    - Rejects any reduction of God’s inner life to His historical actions.
    - Upholds the **ontological distinction** within the Godhead.
    - "The Trinity is not a doctrine derived from abstract speculation, but from the facts of revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics)

3. **Christocentric Revelation**
    - Christ is the supreme revelation of the Triune God.
    - The unity of God’s redemptive work is centered in the person and work of Christ.
    - The **incarnation** is the focal point of God’s self-revelation.
    - The economic missions of the Son and Spirit reveal, but do not exhaust, the inner life of God.
    - "All revelation culminates in the person of Christ." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Method**
    - Theology must be grounded in the unfolding of God’s acts in history.
    - The pattern of revelation follows the pattern of redemption.
    - The **covenantal structure** of history shapes our understanding of God’s self-disclosure.
    - The unity of Scripture is found in the progressive revelation of the Triune God.
    - "The history of redemption is the warp and woof of revelation." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Rejection of Speculative Trinitarianism**
    - Opposes attempts to deduce the Trinity from human experience or philosophical reasoning.
    - Insists on the sufficiency and authority of **Scripture** for Trinitarian doctrine.
    - Warns against collapsing the immanent into the economic Trinity (contra Rahner’s Rule).
    - Emphasizes the mystery and transcendence of God’s inner life.
    - "We must beware of constructing the doctrine of the Trinity from below." (Reformed Dogmatics)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s emphasis on **redemptive history** and the **progressive revelation** of the Triune God provided a foundation for later Reformed responses to Rahner and Barth. His careful distinction between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity** anticipated concerns about collapsing ontological distinctions into historical manifestations. Vos’s biblical-theological method continues to shape Reformed engagement with modern Trinitarian debates, ensuring that the doctrine remains rooted in the unfolding drama of redemption rather than speculative abstraction.
