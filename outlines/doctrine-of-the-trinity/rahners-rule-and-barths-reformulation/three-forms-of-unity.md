# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate classic **Reformed theology** with a strong emphasis on the **Trinity** and the **incarnation** of Christ. While predating both **Rahner’s Rule** (“the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa”) and **Barth’s reformulation**, these confessions provide foundational statements on the **relation between God’s being and God’s acts**, affirming the unity and distinction within the Godhead and the true humanity and divinity of Christ as revealed in redemptive history.

- "We believe in one only God, who is one single essence, in which are three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct, according to their incommunicable properties." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 8–11 (on the Trinity) and 18–19 (on the Incarnation)
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), Lord’s Days 8–14 (on the Apostles’ Creed, Trinity, and Christology)
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), Main Points I–II (on the work of the Triune God in salvation)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical and Reformed, for context and commentary)
- The Theology of the Reformed Confessions 1550–1620 (Benedict P. Pictet, for secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontological and Economic Trinity Distinguished but United**
    - Affirms the **real distinction** of persons in the one divine essence.
    - Teaches that the **Father, Son, and Spirit** are eternally distinct, not merely in revelation.
    - Maintains that God’s **external works** reflect but do not exhaust His inner life.
    - Upholds the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity in creation and redemption.
    - "The Father is the cause, origin, and beginning of all things visible and invisible; the Son is the Word, wisdom, and image of the Father; the Holy Spirit is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father and the Son." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

2. **Revelation of God’s Being in Redemptive History**
    - God’s **self-revelation** in Scripture is the basis for knowledge of the Trinity.
    - The **incarnation** is the supreme manifestation of the Triune God’s saving purpose.
    - The confessions avoid speculation beyond what is revealed in **God’s Word**.
    - The **economic Trinity** is truly God acting, not a mere appearance.
    - "We know these things as they are revealed to us in the Holy Scriptures." (Belgic Confession, Art. 9)

3. **True and Complete Deity and Humanity of Christ**
    - Christ is confessed as **true God and true man** in one person.
    - The **personal union** is neither a mingling nor a separation of natures.
    - The **mediatorial work** of Christ is grounded in His unique person.
    - The confessions reject all forms of **Nestorianism** and **Eutychianism**.
    - "We confess that by this conception the person of the Son is inseparably united and connected with the human nature." (Belgic Confession, Art. 19)

4. **Immutability and Freedom of God’s Essence**
    - God’s **essence** is unchanging and independent of creation.
    - The **Trinity** is not constituted by God’s acts in history.
    - God’s works in salvation history are free expressions of His eternal will.
    - The confessions resist any collapse of the **immanent** into the **economic Trinity**.
    - "God is one single simple spiritual being; He is eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, immutable, infinite, almighty, perfectly wise, just, good, and the overflowing fountain of all good." (Belgic Confession, Art. 1)

5. **Scriptural Sufficiency and Anti-Speculation**
    - All doctrine about God is to be derived from **Scripture alone**.
    - The confessions warn against **philosophical speculation** about God’s inner life.
    - The mystery of the Trinity is to be adored, not explained beyond revelation.
    - The **Three Forms of Unity** provide boundaries for theological reflection on God’s being and acts.
    - "We believe all things contained in them [the canonical books], without any doubt or error." (Belgic Confession, Art. 5)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have shaped the Reformed tradition’s understanding of the **Trinity** and **Christology**, providing a confessional anchor for later debates about the relation between God’s being and His acts. While not engaging Rahner or Barth directly, their careful distinctions and scriptural grounding have influenced responses to modern Trinitarian theology. Their emphasis on the **unity and distinction** within the Godhead, and the sufficiency of revelation, continues to inform Reformed engagement with contemporary theological developments.
