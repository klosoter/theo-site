### ESSAY
At the heart of Augustine's On Christian Teaching lies a simple claim with immense scope: God gave Scripture to draw human beings into the love of God and neighbor, and all interpretation and teaching must serve that end. Out of this central conviction Augustine fashions a comprehensive guide for reading the Bible and for preaching it, one that integrates a theory of signs, a moral ordering of desire, and a disciplined use of classical rhetoric. The work answers a practical crisis in the late Roman church: Scripture is authoritative and yet often obscure, classical learning is potent and yet morally ambiguous, and preachers must feed a mixed flock without flattering their own vanity.

Augustine composed the work across three decades. He wrote Books 1 to 3 in 396 to 397, soon after becoming bishop of Hippo Regius in 395 to 396, then left the project unfinished. In 426 to 427, near the end of his life, he added Book 4 on eloquence and brought the whole to completion. That long arc matters. The early books arise from a new bishop's urgent need to stabilize teaching in North Africa in the wake of Donatist division and in a context marked by the consolidation of the canon at Hippo in 393 and Carthage in 397. The final book reflects a seasoned pastor formed by the controversies of 411 to 418 against the Donatists and the Pelagians, and by the shock of the sack of Rome in 410, who nonetheless insists that holiness and love, not mere technique, make the preacher.

Book 1 establishes the end, the ordo amoris that directs everything else. Augustine distinguishes things to be enjoyed, enjoyed meaning loved for their own sake, from things to be used, used meaning employed as means to that end. Only God, the Trinity, is to be enjoyed. All other goods, including our neighbors and ourselves, are to be used in the sense of being loved in God and ordered toward God. Scripture is given to foster this charity. Augustine presses the consequence with pastoral clarity: if someone understands the words of Scripture in a way that builds up love of God and neighbor, then even if that reading misses the author's precise intention, it accomplishes the end for which Scripture was given. He grounds this in humility before divine pedagogy, since the Word accommodates human weakness by clothing eternal wisdom in temporal signs. Book 1 thus sets the compass: the rule of charity governs interpretation, and enjoyment and use define the moral framework of knowledge.

Book 2 turns to the discovery of what Scripture means, particularly when signs are obscure. Augustine distinguishes things from signs, and situates Scripture as a complex web of signs pointing to divine realities. He urges the would-be interpreter to learn languages, above all Latin but also Greek and Hebrew, so as to resolve ambiguities and assess variants. He affirms the authority of the Septuagint within the church's liturgy, while acknowledging the value of Jerome's developing Latin translation work in the 390s. He urges acquaintance with history, geography, zoology, botany, astronomy, and number, because biblical speech borrows from the created order. Ignorance of these arts breeds fanciful exegesis. The arts are not enemies. They are spoils to be seized from Egypt, a famous Augustinian image that dignifies the plundering of pagan learning for sanctified ends. The canon itself provides the primary rule, so interpreters consult clearer passages to illuminate darker ones, and the whole is measured by the creed, the rule of faith confessed in baptismal settings across the fourth century. Book 2 therefore equips the reader with tools for discovery, submitting all technique to ecclesial authority and the standard of charity.

Book 3 addresses the thicket of figurative speech. Augustine lays down a decisive test. Any reading that seems to command vice or forbid virtue must be figurative, because Scripture cannot undermine the love of God and neighbor. This is the famous charity criterion at work in hermeneutics. Augustine catalogs forms of ambiguity and trope, and shows how context, the analogy of faith, and the larger narrative of salvation rule out fanciful elaboration. He acknowledges that some errors are harmless, and that patient love should tolerate them until better instruction is available. Others are dangerous because they harden the will against charity. The interpreter must cultivate humility, prayer, and moral purification, since sin blinds the mind to the spiritual sense. The church's teachers, bishops above all, guide the faithful through settled teachings and conciliar decisions, and the learner must be docile within this communal discipline.

Book 4 treats what the earlier books leave implicit. Discovery is not the end. The point is to teach and move people toward salvation. Augustine therefore Christianizes classical rhetoric. Drawing from Cicero and Quintilian, he affirms the triad of docere, delectare, movere, that is to teach, to delight, to move. He outlines three styles of speech. The subdued style clarifies truths to attentive minds, the moderate style pleases and holds the interest of the wavering, and the grand style stirs the reluctant to action. Scripture models these styles, from the plainness of the Proverbs to the soaring cadences of the prophets and the letters of Paul. Augustine insists that eloquence is a good servant but a bad master. Holiness of life, fervent prayer, and dependence on the Holy Spirit outweigh any verbal polish. The preacher should speak so that the unlearned understand and the learned are nourished, always aiming at the growth of love in the congregation. He allows that some possess natural eloquence, yet he encourages training and practice for all, for God uses disciplined means to reach his ends.

Two turning points bind the whole. First, by situating interpretation within the aim of charity, Augustine disarms both intellectual pride and literalist rigidity. His charity rule steers readers when they face obscurity, preventing readings that fracture the church or excuse vice. Second, by bringing rhetoric into the service of truth, he breaks the spell of a pagan eloquence that sought praise and power. He offers a pastoral rhetoric, lean and purposeful, fit for a church stretched between imperial decline and the demands of catechesis.

The theological and intellectual significance is wide. Augustine gives a classic account of signs and things that would shape medieval semiotics, with echoes in later reflections on language. He sacralizes the liberal arts without surrendering their direction, thus supplying a template for Christian education. His scriptural method, clear passages interpreting obscure ones and the creed as a guide, underwrites canonical exegesis and safeguards doctrinal integrity. He acknowledges the human labor of interpretation and the necessity of communal authority, yet he refuses to let any technique eclipse love.

Reception confirms the design. Cassiodorus in the 550s recommended the work in the Institutiones as a guide for monastic study. Isidore of Seville in the early 600s and the Venerable Bede in the early 700s distilled its principles into encyclopedic handbooks. Carolingian reformers, including Alcuin who died in 804, used its spirit to shape cathedral schools. The Victorines in the twelfth century blended its attention to literal sense with sapiential reading. Aquinas in the thirteenth century orients preaching to charity in a way that presupposes Augustine's rule. Humanists like Erasmus, publishing the Greek New Testament in 1516, repeatedly emphasize clarity, languages, and moral intent, a complex heir to Augustine's program. Across confessional lines in the sixteenth century, Catholic and Protestant exegetes cite Augustine's charity rule even as they debate its application. The Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563 urged preaching that is doctrinal and moral, a stance easily read through Book 4.

In sum, On Christian Teaching is one craft, not four. Book 1 sets the end, love of God and neighbor. Book 2 and Book 3 supply tools for discovery, languages and arts, literal and figurative discipline, all under the rule of faith. Book 4 orders delivery, rhetoric that teaches, delights, and moves, under the primacy of holiness. Augustine's main point is that Scripture is a divine medicine preparing our love for God, and that both interpretation and preaching are arts ordered to that healing.
