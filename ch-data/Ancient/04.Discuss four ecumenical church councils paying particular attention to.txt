### ESSAY
The fourth and fifth centuries placed the church before a pressing tension. The gospel proclaimed Jesus as true God and true man, and believers invoked the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in baptism and prayer. Yet the conceptual tools to say how this worship fit with strict monotheism were contested. Four ecumenical councils defined the grammar of Christian speech about God and Christ, rejecting proposals that seemed pious and rational but proved corrosive to salvation and worship. What follows traces Nicaea in 325, Constantinople in 381, Ephesus in 431, and Chalcedon in 451, each confronting a named error while clarifying the creed of the church.

Nicaea answered Arianism. Arius, an Alexandrian presbyter active around 318 to 336, taught that the Son was not eternal but was the first and highest creature, made from nothing by the will of the Father. In catchy verses of the Thalia he declared, there was when he was not. He read texts like Proverbs 8 about Wisdom being created, and he wanted to preserve the unbegotten uniqueness of the Father. The problem is that a creature, however exalted, cannot reveal God as God, nor redeem by bestowing life from within the divine life. If the Son is not truly God, worship of the Son becomes idolatry, and the gospel collapses into an unequal commerce between Creator and creature. Athanasius, then a deacon in Alexandria and later bishop, insisted that only the one who is by nature Son can give adoption, and only the one who is consubstantial with the Father can make God known. In 325, under Constantine, bishops met in Nicaea. They confessed that the Son is begotten, not made, of the substance of the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, and they introduced the embattled term homoousios, same substance, to exclude the Arian evasion. The anathemas of Nicaea targeted the slogans of Arius, forbidding any confession that the Son came to be from things that were not or that he is of another hypostasis or substance than the Father. The council did not end the controversy, and Athanasius suffered repeated exiles between 335 and 366, but Nicaea established a nonnegotiable boundary. Salvation requires that God act as God in Christ, and prayer to the Son presupposes his equality with the Father.

The second council, Constantinople in 381, consolidated Nicaea and addressed pneumatological and christological deviations. After Constantine, rival pro Arian and pro Nicene coalitions contended, producing a flurry of creeds. Under Theodosius I, who issued the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, a pro Nicene party gained imperial backing. Two errors met at this council. The Macedonians or Pneumatomachians denied the full divinity of the Holy Spirit, treating the Spirit as a ministering power inferior to Father and Son. Apollinarianism, named for Apollinaris of Laodicea, proposed that in the incarnation the divine Word took the place of a rational human soul. The Cappadocians provided key arguments. Basil, in On the Holy Spirit written in 375, appealed to liturgy and doxology, noting that the Spirit is invoked in baptism and glorified with Father and Son, so the Spirit must share the same divine nature. Gregory of Nazianzus, in the Theological Orations of 379 to 381, articulated the formula of one ousia and three hypostases, thus differentiating persons without splitting the divine nature. The council reaffirmed the Nicene homoousios for the Son, condemned those who denied the Spirit as Lord and giver of life, and anathematized Apollinarianism because what is not assumed is not healed. In other words, the Word must assume a complete human nature, mind and will, in order to restore the whole person. The creed was expanded to confess the Holy Spirit as Lord and life giver, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified. Constantinople closed the Arian era and set the trinitarian grammar that guided later debate.

The third council, Ephesus in 431, dealt with Nestorianism. Nestorius, installed as bishop of Constantinople in 428, resisted the Marian title Theotokos, God bearer, preferring Christotokos, Christ bearer. He feared confusion of natures and argued that the man Jesus was joined to the Word in a moral or prosopic union rather than a union of person. Cyril of Alexandria, drawing on Alexandrian exegesis and a soteriology of deification, pressed the opposite claim. The Word himself, the eternal Son, became flesh and is the subject of all the actions of Jesus. In letters to Nestorius and in the Twelve Anathemas of 430, Cyril asserted a hypostatic union. There is one person, the Word, who truly suffered and died according to the human nature, and yet remains impassible according to the divine nature. Ephesus was stormy. Theodosius II convened it, John of Antioch arrived late, Cyril opened proceedings without him, and two rival gatherings condemned the other. The Roman legates backed Cyril. The council affirmed Theotokos as a christological safeguard. It condemned Nestorius because a doctrine of two subjects destroys the communication of idioms and undermines the efficacy of the cross. Only if the one who dies is truly the Word made flesh can the death be saving for all. A later settlement, the Formula of Union in 433, tried to heal the Antiochene and Alexandrian parties, accepting Theotokos and confessing one Christ and Lord acknowledged in two natures. Ephesus thus drew a clear line against Christological duality of person while preserving the distinctness of the two natures.

The fourth council, Chalcedon in 451, responded to Eutychianism and to the Latrocinium, the Robber Council of 449. Eutyches, an archimandrite in Constantinople, claimed that after the union there was only one nature of the incarnate Word. In practice this blurred or absorbed the humanity into the divinity. Flavian, bishop of Constantinople, condemned him in 448, but Dioscorus of Alexandria secured his rehabilitation at the violent synod of 449. Pope Leo I of Rome wrote a doctrinal letter, the Tome to Flavian in 449, arguing that the one person of Christ exists in two natures complete and unconfused, the properties of each nature remaining, and the actions of each nature occurring in communion of the one person. Leo read Scripture with a twofold economy, birth and suffering according to the humanity, miracles and eternal generation according to the divinity. Chalcedon convened under Marcian and Pulcheria. The council deposed Dioscorus, vindicated Flavian who had died from injuries sustained at the Latrocinium, received the Tome as in accord with Cyril, and issued the Definition. It confessed one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, acknowledged in two natures without confusion, without change, without division, without separation. The distinction of natures is not annulled by the union, and the properties of each nature are preserved. This definition safeguarded the full humanity and full divinity of Christ while preventing a split into two persons. The problem with Eutychian or Monophysite claims is that an absorbed or fused humanity cannot represent us or obey for us, and a single mixed nature cannot anchor the sacramental and scriptural attributions given to Christ. Chalcedon thus gave the church stable terms for preaching the gospel.

These four councils together clarified how to speak of God and Christ. Nicaea secured the true divinity of the Son against Arianism, thereby grounding Christian worship and salvation in the life of God. Constantinople articulated the trinitarian pattern and affirmed the Spirit as Lord against the Pneumatomachians, while ruling out Apollinarian shortcuts to unity. Ephesus defended the unity of person against Nestorian duality, protecting Theotokos as a christological confession. Chalcedon gave a balanced formula for the two natures against Eutychian collapse, uniting Rome and much of the East around a shared doctrinal grammar.

Reception was mixed. Arianism lingered among Gothic and Vandal kingdoms into the sixth century. The non Chalcedonian churches of Egypt, Syria, and Armenia rejected Chalcedon as a betrayal of Cyril, producing long lasting schisms and complex negotiations at Constantinople II in 553. Later, Constantinople III in 680 to 681 condemned Monothelitism, further clarifying that Christ has two wills corresponding to his two natures. The Niceno Constantinopolitan Creed became the basic liturgical confession, and the Chalcedonian Definition became the magisterial norm in Latin and Greek theology. Medieval writers like Leo and later John of Damascus drew on these councils, while Augustine, in De Trinitate written roughly 399 to 419, supplied a Western framework for the triune life in harmony with Nicaea and Constantinople. Historians have debated whether these controversies were philosophical games or political struggles. A better reading sees biblical exegesis, worship, and pastoral care driving the formulas, with imperial power shaping the stage but not writing the script.

By settling how to name God and how to confess Christ, the first four councils gave Christian theology its durable core and set boundaries within which faithful reflection could flourish.
