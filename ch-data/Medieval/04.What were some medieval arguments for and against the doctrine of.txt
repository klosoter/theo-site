### ESSAY
The medieval West did not invent Eucharistic devotion, but it labored to give it a grammar. At stake was a tight question with pastoral weight. When the priest consecrates the bread and wine, what, precisely, has happened. The claim that their substance is changed into the body and blood of Christ, while the appearances remain, is what the West came to call transubstantiation. For centuries, champions and critics argued over scripture, patristic voices, metaphysics, and pastoral consequences, seeking to protect both the integrity of sign and the truth of presence.

The context begins in the Carolingian ninth century, a period of schools and careful Latin. Around 831 to 833, Paschasius Radbertus of Corbie wrote De corpore et sanguine Domini, teaching that the consecrated bread is truly, substantially the historical body born of Mary, the same given on the cross. He leaned on the words of institution, This is my body, the realism of Ambrose and Hilary, and a pastoral instinct that stressed the very Christ whom believers adore. In the 840s, Ratramnus, also of Corbie, wrote a work with the same title yet offered a different emphasis. He argued that the sacrament gives the body of Christ according to a spiritual mode, that the bread becomes the figure which confers the truth it signifies, and that sense perception still meets true breadlike qualities. Ratramnus did not deny the reality of the gift, but he resisted a crude corporalism and appealed to Augustine, who spoke of visible signs conveying an invisible grace. Already the lines were drawn. One side wanted language of conversion and identity, the other insisted on the figural and sacramental mode.

The eleventh century sharpened the dispute through the controversialist Berengar of Tours, active from the 1040s until his death in 1088. Berengar applied dialectic to authorities and insisted that the bread remains after consecration. He relied on passages from Augustine and on the resistance of sense to a claim that seemed to violate ordinary logic. He also took up an older treatise attributed to John Scotus Eriugena that attacked grosser forms of realism and emphasized spiritual feeding. Against him stood Lanfranc of Bec and Canterbury, who wrote De corpore et sanguine Domini around the 1060s, Guitmund of Aversa, and later Alger of Liege. Their argument was twofold. First, the words of Christ perform what they say, not only signify it, as Ambrose had taught. Second, the church has always adored the consecrated elements as Christ himself, which would be idolatry if the bread were not truly changed at the deepest level. Synods pressed Berengar repeatedly. Vercelli in 1050 condemned the Eriugenian book he used. Rome in 1059 forced him to confess that the bread and wine are changed and that the body of Christ can be truly handled and broken sacramentally, language Berengar later tried to soften. A Lateran synod in 1079 under Gregory VII secured another recantation, though with less aggressive phrasing. This is a turning point. The West had decided against the thesis that the substance of bread remains.

As the twelfth century unfolded, the vocabulary matured. Hildebert of Lavardin, archbishop of Tours, used the term transubstantiation around 1100 to name a conversion of substance. Alger of Liege, in works on the sacrament, gathered patristic witnesses and canonical practice to explain how the sign gives the reality by divine power. Peter Lombard, in the Sentences compiled in the 1150s, stabilized theological teaching in the schools. He spoke of the conversion of the whole substance of bread into the body and of wine into blood, a conversion that leaves the accidents, the appearances, intact. The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 made this school language official. It taught that by the divine power, the bread and wine are transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ. The term migrated from learned usage into canon law and liturgical teaching.

With the rise of Aristotle in the schools after 1150, defenders of the doctrine gained new tools and new problems. Thomas Aquinas, writing the Summa theologiae in the 1260s, offered the most influential account. He argued in book three, questions 75 to 77, that the conversion is not natural but sacramental, not a change of accidents but of substance. By the power of the words, the whole substance of bread ceases and the whole substance of the body of Christ comes to be under the species of bread. The accidents of bread remain, upheld by divine power without a subject. In this way, sense is not deceived, for it reports what it rightly sees, namely the accidents, while intellect assents to the deeper truth revealed by Christ. Aquinas added two crucial clarifications. Christ is present not as in a place, but by sacramental mode. Thus his body is not measured or divided by the host, and one Christ is present in many places without multiplying the body. He also articulated concomitance, that where the body is, there also are blood and soul and divinity, so that the faithful receiving under one kind do not lack the whole Christ. Bonaventure and later Scotus agreed on the central point of conversion, though Scotus refined the account of accidents without subject and of the way Christ is under the dimensions of the species.

Alongside these constructive accounts were counterarguments that never fully disappeared. The sense objection claimed that the eyes and tongue are witnesses God has given, and they report bread and wine. Against this, defenders replied that sense reports accidents and has no competence about substance, and that God can maintain accidents by power. The local presence objection insisted that a true body cannot be in many places at once, nor can it be divided into crumbs without mutilation. Defenders answered that the presence is not local but sacramental, and that Christ is whole under every part of the species, just as he is whole under every coordinate of a measured place in heaven. Some critics raised a moral charge of cannibalism. Defenders responded that sacramental eating is not the chewing of the natural manner, but a supernatural feeding under a sign that truly gives what it signifies. Others appealed to Augustine, who called the sacrament a sign and urged figurative understanding of certain scriptural phrases. Defenders invoked Augustine in turn, noting that for him a sign can convey the very reality it signifies, and pointing to his sermons that speak of adoring the sacrament and of the altar holding what hung on the cross.

Late medieval dissent rekindled the debate. John Wyclif, active in the 1370s and 1380s, rejected transubstantiation in favor of remanence, the view that the substance of bread remains while Christ is present by a kind of conjunction. He argued that accidents cannot exist without a subject, that a conversion without change in appearances violates the metaphysics of substance, and that the church had erred by innovation. Oxford condemned his propositions at the Blackfriars synod in 1382. Jan Hus, influenced by Wyclif, preached reform and was executed at Constance in 1415, partly in a context charged by Eucharistic controversy. There were also speculative Latin proposals that did not deny real presence but sought another account, such as impanation or consubstantial presence, associated with thinkers like John of Paris around 1305, who resisted accidents without subject. These alternatives failed to carry the schools, in part because Lateran IV had canonized the language of conversion and because the growing logic of the sacrament required a change in what the sign is.

The resolution in the high Middle Ages came through a mix of authority and argument. The councils named the what, transubstantiation. The scholastics explained the how as far as reason could venture, then stopped at the mystery. The theological significance is broad. The debate forced the West to clarify the relation of sign and thing signified, to refine metaphysics of substance and accidents, and to state carefully the mode of Christ's presence. It also shaped piety. Elevation of the host spread in the thirteenth century, Urban IV instituted Corpus Christi in 1264, and adoration at the moment of consecration became a common practice, bound to the conviction that Christ is truly present under the species. Yet the doctrine was not an isolated prize of the schools. It was the hinge of a larger sacramental system that bore the church's teaching on sacrifice, priesthood, and unity.

By 1215 the Western church had reached a normative formulation, and by the later fourteenth century it had confronted and condemned the primary dissent. The legacy carried forward into the councils of the sixteenth century and into ongoing ecumenical engagements, where questions about language, metaphysics, and biblical sense still echo from those medieval classrooms and synods. In sum, medieval arguments for and against transubstantiation taught the West how to confess a mystery without denying sense and how to reason about presence without trying to cage it.
