### ESSAY
A medieval Christian could pray the same Lord's Prayer in Latin or Greek and refer to the same councils of the first five centuries, yet by the mid eleventh century Rome and Constantinople exchanged excommunications and drifted into a lasting estrangement. The tension was not born in a single moment. It grew from distinct habits of authority, language, and law, was sharpened by rival claims and missionary contests, and finally hardened by war and occupation. The central division is often called the Great Schism, marked in 1054 by mutual excommunications, then deepened by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. To see why it happened, we must track the long arc from late antique structures to medieval controversies, and the mix of theological, political, and cultural factors that pushed the churches apart.

Late antique Christianity had cultivated a structure of five patriarchal sees, Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. The ecumenical councils of Nicaea in 325 and Constantinople in 381, and later Chalcedon in 451, distributed honor and jurisdiction, and imperial law, exemplified in Justinian's legislation in the sixth century, gave a juridical profile to this pentarchy. Rome claimed an apostolic primacy grounded in Peter's confession, while Constantinople claimed second place on the basis of being the New Rome. This tension was managed as long as empire and the common language of governance supported mediation. The collapse of imperial power in the West, and the rise of Germanic kingdoms, altered the balance. By 800, when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as emperor, the West signaled a rival imperium. The Carolingian court fostered its own theological and legal culture. Works like the Libri Carolini of the 790s critiqued the Greek defense of icons, not because the West rejected images after Nicaea II in 787, but because translation and intellectual worlds diverged. Already we see miscommunication layered over real differences.

In the seventh century the Quinisext Council, also called Trullo in 692, set canons that codified Eastern practices on clerical marriage and fasting. Rome did not accept these canons, especially the allowance of married priests, though both sides shared a commitment to celibate bishops. This created different pastoral shapes. Liturgical divergence grew too. The West adopted unleavened bread for the Eucharist, the azymes, while the East kept leavened bread. In normal times difference did not mean division. Yet difference became weaponized when trust eroded.

The Filioque controversy became the most visible doctrinal marker of disunity. The phrase and the Son had entered Latin versions of the Niceno Constantinopolitan Creed in Spain in the late sixth century, notably at Toledo in 589, partly as a defense against Arianism. By the ninth century the Carolingians pressed for its wider use. The Greeks objected twice over, to the theology and to the unilateral alteration of the Creed. The East held that the Spirit proceeds from the Father, as in John 15, and spoke of a temporal mission through the Son without changing the eternal procession. The West, reading Augustine and later Latin tradition, held that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as from one principle. Photius, the luminous scholar who became patriarch in 858, wrote his Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit to argue that the Filioque threatened the monarchy of the Father in the Trinity. He pointed to conciliar norms that forbade altering the Creed. The West countered that the Filioque clarified the consubstantial communion of the divine persons and had long been part of Latin worship.

The Photian Schism of 863 to 867 exposed more than Trinitarian differences. It involved a clash over jurisdiction in Bulgaria, where both Rome and Constantinople sought to shape the newly Christian polity. Pope Nicholas I asserted Roman appellate jurisdiction, insisted that the deposition of Patriarch Ignatius and the elevation of Photius violated canon law, and sent legates to Constantinople. The legates wavered, and a council in 867 condemned Nicholas. Political change then restored Ignatius, and a council in 869 to 870 condemned Photius. After Ignatius died in 877, Photius returned. The council of 879 to 880 rehabilitated Photius and rejected the Filioque. Historians debate which council deserves the title of Eighth Ecumenical. The more important point is that two models of authority were asserting themselves. The Roman model framed primacy as universal jurisdiction. The Constantinopolitan model framed primacy within conciliar synodality across the patriarchates. Each side could quote canon law and history to support its stance.

The dramatic exchange of 1054 came in a charged political atmosphere. In southern Italy, Norman conquests pressed Greek monasteries and bishops, and Latin practice was imposed. In Constantinople, Patriarch Michael Cerularius criticized Latin customs, especially azymes. Pope Leo IX, a reformer shaped by the Gregorian currents in the West, sent legates led by Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida. Leo's letter cited forged documents like the Donation of Constantine to bolster Roman claims, and Humbert drafted polemics against Greek customs. When Leo died in April 1054, the canonical status of the legates weakened, yet they proceeded. On 16 July 1054 they placed a bull of excommunication on the altar of Hagia Sophia. Cerularius convened a synod and excommunicated the legates. In the narrow sense, only persons were excommunicated, and the event did not instantly break all communion. But the act became a symbol, and the deeper currents ensured that reconciliation would be hard.

The Fourth Crusade sealed the fracture with blood and plunder. In 1204, Latin crusaders diverted to Constantinople, sacked the city, and established a Latin patriarchate. This was not a theological debate. It was a violent occupation of the most important Eastern see. The memory of 1204 eclipsed earlier quarrels. When the Council of Lyons in 1274 achieved a short union under Emperor Michael VIII, it had almost no local reception in the East. The Council of Florence in 1439 produced a learned decree of union, Laetentur Caeli, which addressed the Filioque by distinguishing modes of procession and tried to articulate primacy as service to unity. Yet its reception faltered in Constantinople and among monks and clergy, who could not forget 1204 and who distrusted Roman juridical claims. In 1453 the fall of Constantinople reshaped the political frame entirely.

Theologically, the issue of authority remained the hinge. The West, nourished by Augustinian thought and the development of canon law in collections like the Decretum of Gratian in the twelfth century, conceptualized the papal office as visible head of the universal church with ordinary and immediate jurisdiction. The East, nourished by the Cappadocians and a strong conciliar memory, conceptualized the church as a communion of local churches, with Rome holding a primacy of honor and a final court of appeal, not a jurisdiction that supplanted local synods. On the Filioque, later scholastic theology defended the formula as consistent with one principle in the Godhead, while Byzantine theologians emphasized the monarchy of the Father and spoke of procession through the Son in the economy. Liturgical and pastoral differences like the marriage of priests in the East and wider clerical celibacy in the West, the use of leavened versus unleavened bread, and divergent fasting rules, became boundary markers.

Reception and legacy extend beyond the medieval period, but the medieval shape of disunity is clear. Early medieval misunderstanding, fostered by language and translation, turned into open conflict during the Photian controversy. Eleventh century reform and papal claims heightened tension. The symbolic excommunications of 1054 fixed a narrative of separation. The Fourth Crusade created an open wound. Later councils could draft theology of union, but without trust, legal convergence, and a shared memory, they could not build a lasting communion. The East learned to live under new imperial guardians, first Latin crusaders briefly, then Ottoman rule, while the West developed papal monarchy and scholastic systems. Each tradition prayed, taught, and governed in coherent ways, yet the bridge between them had been burned.

Historians today emphasize gradual estrangement rather than a single break. They note many instances of shared saints and occasional communion in the century after 1054. They also point to structural factors that made friction likely. Rival imperial claims after 800, missionary competition in Bulgaria and Rus around 860 to 988, divergent legal corpora, and the increasing Westward insistence on uniformity under Rome created a pattern. At the same time, the East experienced imperial pressure and a theology that was suspicious of legal centralization. One can identify the Great Schism of 1054 as a significant division, but its causes were layered and its resolution was obstructed by politics and war as much as by doctrine.

What contributed to East and West disunity was the slow divergence of authority, language, and law, punctuated by crises over the Filioque and jurisdiction, and crystallized in 1054 and 1204, leaving a legacy of parallel Christian worlds.
