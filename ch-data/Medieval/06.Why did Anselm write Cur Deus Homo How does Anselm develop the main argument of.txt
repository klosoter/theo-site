### ESSAY
The question Why did God become man stands at the hinge of Christian doctrine. In Cur Deus Homo, written around 1094 to 1098, Anselm of Canterbury set himself to answer it with a new rigor. He wrote while displaced from his see during the long quarrels of English investiture, and he crafted a work that would not rest on scriptural proof texts but would seek necessary reasons. Anselm addresses a learned monk named Boso, and through Boso he imagines Jews, Muslims, and skeptical Christians who ask whether the Incarnation and Passion are coherent. His aim is not curiosity but a pastoral apologetic, to show that the God-man is the fitting, indeed necessary, remedy for sin.

Anselm's context matters. Born in 1033 and trained at Bec under Lanfranc, Anselm embodies the monastic reforming energy of the mid eleventh century. The monastic schools were maturing into early scholasticism, with its dialogical method, precise distinctions, and confidence in reason as a servant of faith. Politically, the Investiture Controversy beginning in 1075 drew churchmen into clashes over law, office, and authority. Anselm became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1093, collided with William II, and later Henry I, and spent stretches on the Continent where he wrote. This matrix of law, honor, and order can be heard in his moral and juridical idiom. His rhetoric of honor, or honor Dei, draws on feudal customs, yet he wields it to articulate divine justice and mercy, not to baptize social hierarchy.

Anselm develops his case in two books. Book I clears ground by rejecting the old ransom-to-the-devil motif. God owes the devil nothing, he says, since the devil is a rebel and holds no rightful claim. The real problem is not a transaction with evil powers, but the debt created by human sin against the divine honor. Every rational creature owes God rectitude of will, that is, an unwavering orientation to God's justice. Sin dishonors God by withholding what is due. Because God is just and ordered, God cannot simply overlook this deficit. Gratuitous pardon without satisfaction would mean God is indifferent to order, and this is unthinkable in Anselm's framework.

He then introduces a key distinction about necessity. God is not compelled by any external force, so there is no absolute necessity that he save. Yet given the purposes God has set, namely, the realization of the rational creature in blessedness and the maintenance of divine justice, a consequent necessity emerges. If God is to forgive while remaining truthful and just, there must be satisfaction. Satisfaction means a recompense that restores order by rendering more honor to God than the dishonor caused by sin. Punishment could serve justice, yet God wills merciful restoration. Mercy, however, must pass through justice, and satisfaction is the path.

Anselm presses the logic further. Human beings owe God everything as a matter of justice, even before sin. Once we have sinned, we owe more than everything if we are to make recompense. This is impossible for finite creatures. We cannot pay the debt. At the same time, justice requires that the debt be paid by humanity, since humanity incurred it. The impasse generates the central axiom of Cur Deus Homo. Only God can make the satisfaction, yet only a human being ought to make it. Therefore a God-man is necessary. This is not a mere convenience but a fitting conclusion from divine justice and mercy applied to human sin.

In Book II, Anselm unfolds the qualifications and effects of this God-man. The mediator must be true God and true man, free of sin, born of a woman yet not under Adam's debt, hence the virginal conception. He must die, not by necessity of nature, but voluntarily, since forced death would be punishment, not satisfaction. The value of his life is immeasurable because of his divinity, so his self-offering exceeds any finite offense. Thus the death is supererogatory, offering more honor than required, and this surplus becomes a treasury of merit that can be communicated to others. Because the God-man does not need the reward for himself, he can bestow it on those united to him by faith and the sacraments.

Anselm also treats the resurrection. Death is the payment freely given, but continued death would not belong to the reward of such righteousness. Therefore it is fitting that the God-man rise to a life beyond death. Resurrection, then, vindicates the justice of God in rewarding the mediator. The entire economy remains, for Anselm, a harmony of justice and mercy. Mercy is God's gift of the mediator and the communication of his merit. Justice is God's unwavering rectitude in maintaining order and rewarding righteousness.

The cumulative argument is striking for its internal coherence and for what it set aside. By displacing the devil from the center of atonement, Anselm refuses mythic bargain imagery and moves the issue to the relation between God and humanity. By insisting on reason, he invites interlocutors to consider Christian doctrine not as arbitrary will but as wisdom. By making the Incarnation integral to atonement, he prepares later theology to say that Christ is not an afterthought but the center of the divine plan.

The strengths of Cur Deus Homo are considerable. It offers a robust theodicy of forgiveness. God does not simply cancel debts, which would trivialize evil, nor does he crush sinners, which would erase mercy. Instead justice and mercy interpenetrate through the free self-gift of the God-man. The account clarifies the relation of sin, debt, and reconciliation and sets a template for later discussions of merit and satisfaction in penance. Its careful distinctions, especially about kinds of necessity, model scholastic method. And it proved profoundly influential. Peter Lombard absorbed its logic in the Sentences around 1150. Thomas Aquinas in the Summa theologiae, written 1265 to 1274, reworked Anselm's insight into a broader account of merit, satisfaction, and sacrifice. The Western pastoral system that culminated in Lateran IV in 1215, with its discipline of confession and satisfaction, resonated with the grammar Anselm supplied.

There are weaknesses as well. The honor language is anchored in a feudal imaginary. Many have asked whether God's honor must be conceived as a quantitative commodity that can be repaid. If the calculus is too transactional, it risks portraying God as constrained by a legal code external to God's goodness. Anselm tries to avoid this by insisting that the necessity is consequent on God's truthful will, yet the worry remains. He speaks sparingly of the resurrection's transformative victory and gives little to themes of Christus Victor or recapitulation that were prominent among Greek fathers. The Holy Spirit is virtually absent. Scripture's narrative texture is thinned by the deliberate method that brackets biblical authority in order to persuade by reason. Later developments, especially the move from satisfaction to penal substitution in certain Reformation theologies, draw a different conclusion about the role of punishment that Anselm himself did not teach, yet which often rides under his name. Finally, the idea of a transferable treasury of surplus merit, though not developed by Anselm into later practices, opens the door to an economy of merits that can turn mechanistic.

Reception confirms both the power and the limits of his project. Peter Abelard, who died in 1142, objected that atonement is primarily moral transformation through love, not a satisfaction of debt. The East has often demurred at the legal idiom and emphasized deification and victory. Medieval scholastics, however, found in Anselm a framework they could refine. And modern historians have noted how Cur Deus Homo emerged from real social worlds of lord and vassal, even as it transcended them.

Anselm wrote to show that the God-man was not an arbitrary choice but the wise way in which God remains just while justifying the ungodly, and this remains his enduring achievement.
