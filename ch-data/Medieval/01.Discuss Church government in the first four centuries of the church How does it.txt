### ESSAY
A central tension frames the history of church government in the first four centuries. The Jesus movement began as a network of communities animated by charisms and missionary leadership, yet by the fourth century it had become a public institution with bishops, defined territories, synods, and imperial recognition. The question is whether the early pattern is essentially the same as the medieval system that followed, or whether the later order represents a reconfiguration. The answer requires tracing how episcopal leadership crystallized, how conciliar and metropolitan structures emerged, and how claims of Roman primacy interacted with local autonomy, then contrasting this with medieval legal centralization and papal monarchy.

The first century exhibits fluid leadership. The Didache, likely late first or early second century, assumes prophets, teachers, and local bishops and deacons, with no clear universal template. First Clement, written from Rome to Corinth around 96, intervenes to heal a presbyteral dispute by appealing to order and apostolic precedent. The letter is fraternal yet confident, a Roman voice acting to maintain peace among equals rather than asserting juridical supremacy. What we do not yet find is a fixed threefold ministry everywhere or a single bishop per city as the only model.

By the early second century, key witnesses insist on the monoepiscopal pattern in major urban centers. Ignatius of Antioch, martyred under Trajan around 107 to 110, instructs the churches of Asia Minor to knit unity to one bishop, with a council of presbyters and ministers who serve as deacons. For Ignatius, the bishop presides at the Eucharist, embodies the community, and is the safeguard against schism and false teaching. The bishop s sacramental presidency and power to reconcile become hallmarks of order. This was not everywhere at once, yet by mid second century the threefold ministry spreads across the Mediterranean cities.

The theological rationale soon followed. Irenaeus of Lyons, writing around 180 in Against Heresies, argues that bishops succeed the apostles in teaching and oversight. Apostolic succession in the churches, he says, anchors the rule of faith against gnostic speculation. He points to the church of Rome as a touchstone because of its eminent foundation and continuous witness. This is not yet a theory of juridical supremacy. It is an argument that continuity in episcopal sees preserves the apostolic gospel.

Urban episcopacy organized itself using Roman civic patterns. Each bishop presided over the church in a city with its surrounding territory, the civitas. Presbyters formed a council around the bishop, deacons served in liturgy and almsgiving, and readers and subdeacons emerged as stable orders. The Apostolic Tradition, attributed to Hippolytus and often dated to around 215, preserves ordination prayers and rubrics that lift us into a world where bishops ordain, presbyters advise, and deacons assist, all in a sacramental frame. Rural bishops, called chorepiscopi, appear as auxiliaries in outlying areas, a sign of expansion and administrative adaptation.

In the third century, synods became a normal means of resolving disputes. The Easter controversy in the 190s displays both regional autonomy and Roman initiative. Bishop Victor of Rome, around 189 to 199, threatened to sever communion with the churches of Asia over quartodeciman practice, yet other bishops, including Irenaeus, urged patience. Authority was persuasive and moral as much as juridical. Later, the rebaptism controversy in 255 to 256 set Cyprian of Carthage against Stephen of Rome. Cyprian taught that bishops share one episcopate and retain freedom in their sees. He asserted the unity of the church in the unity of the bishops, and though he honored Rome, he denied any universal jurisdiction to impose a practice outside a council. Regional councils at Carthage and across Africa voiced this collegial stance.

Persecution and imperial policy reconfigured governance. The Diocletianic persecution in 303 to 311 fractured communities and gave rise to Donatist rigorism in North Africa, which insisted that traditors could not validly minister. Constantine s conversion and the Edict of Milan in 313 legalized the church and brought imperial power into ecclesial arbitration. The Council of Arles in 314 condemned Donatism, and appeals moved through bishops to imperial ears. Constantine convened the First Council of Nicaea in 325 to settle the Arian crisis and to establish canons that defined structures. Canon 4 required at least three bishops to ordain a bishop with the metropolitan s consent, canon 6 acknowledged the ancient privileges of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch by custom, and canon 15 discouraged the translation of bishops from one see to another. These canons reveal a church ordered by provinces, with metropolitan archbishops presiding regionally, and a few senior sees recognized by custom.

The fourth century saw increasing definition. The Council of Sardica around 343 introduced a limited right of appeal to the bishop of Rome in cases of episcopal deposition, a sign that Rome could serve as court of last resort when consensus failed. The Council of Constantinople in 381 confirmed Nicene faith and granted the bishop of Constantinople the second place in honor after Rome, because it was the New Rome. Leo I of Rome, bishop from 440 to 461, preached the primacy of Peter s see and asserted a universal pastoral care. His Tome to Flavian in 449 shaped the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which acclaimed his Christological teaching even as its canon 28 affirmed the privileges of Constantinople, provoking Rome s protest. Thus by the late fourth and fifth century, a patriarchal pattern was emerging, with Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem as leading sees, though the exact balance of honor, appeal, and jurisdiction remained contested.

What, then, characterizes government in the first four centuries. It is episcopal, sacramental, and conciliar. Authority is anchored in the city bishop, with presbyters and deacons in ordered roles. Synods decide disputed matters, metropolitans coordinate provinces, and a few senior sees hold precedence and convening authority. Roman primacy is moral, doctrinal, and appellate, growing in clarity but not yet a universal administrative control. The empire plays a visible role, convening councils and enforcing their decrees, while bishops guard the freedom of doctrine and discipline. The picture is collegial and layered, more network than pyramid.

The medieval system differs in degree and kind. Between the ninth and thirteenth centuries, the West fashioned a papal monarchy grounded in law, benefices, and centralized administration. The Pseudo Isidorean Decretals in the mid ninth century strengthened episcopal immunity and papal appellate jurisdiction by attributing ancient authority to papal letters. The Gregorian Reform, from the 1050s to the Concordat of Worms in 1122, fought lay investiture and made the freedom of the church a platform for papal authority. Gregory VII in 1075 issued propositions later known as the Dictatus Papae that claimed the papal right to depose kings and to have appeals terminate at Rome. Innocent III, from 1198 to 1216, reached the high watermark of plenitude of power. The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 legislated for the whole Latin Church on doctrine, discipline, and pastoral care, requiring annual confession and communion and systematizing parish life.

Administrative centralization undergirded these claims. Gratian s Decretum around 1140 synthesized canons and papal letters into a jurisprudence that reshaped governance into a legal science. Papal decretals and collections made Rome the final court. Papal legates supervised provinces, cathedral chapters elected bishops under papal oversight, and appeals flow to the curia. The parish network matured in the twelfth century, clerical celibacy was enforced more uniformly, and archdeacons and archpriests became fixed officials. Bishops often became temporal lords, bound in feudal bonds, and their governance mixed pastoral and princely roles. Monastic and mendicant orders, from Cluny in 910 to Cistercians in 1098 and the friars in the early thirteenth century, operated translocally under papal protection, creating channels that bypassed some episcopal structures in the name of reform and mission.

If the early order was a communion of local churches bound by synods and custom, the medieval order was a legal commonwealth under a monarchic head. Both affirmed apostolic succession, episcopal ordination, and the sacramental structure. Both used councils to decide doctrine. Yet in the first four centuries, the balance lay with local episcopal authority and conciliar consensus, with Rome as senior witness and court of appeal in hard cases. In the medieval period, the balance shifted decisively toward Roman initiative, juridical uniformity, and administrative reach.

The legacy is paradoxical. Medieval reformers claimed to restore ancient order, citing Nicaea and the fathers. They did recover discipline and clerical integrity. Yet they also built new instruments of centralized government that had no exact early analogue. The early pattern supplied the DNA, the medieval system engineered a body from it. The difference is not a break of substance in sacramental order, but a transformation in scope, method, and center of gravity.

In short, the first four centuries gave the church a collegial episcopate knit by councils and custom, while the Middle Ages erected upon that foundation a papal and legal architecture that redefined how the same ministry governed the whole.
