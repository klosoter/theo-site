### ESSAY
The long fourteenth century strained the old concord between scholarly theology and ecclesiastical authority. Avignon popes asserted centralized discipline, monarchs pressed competing claims, and university masters turned speculative daring toward pastoral and political questions. In that pressurized climate some theologians and spiritual writers fell decisively out of favor. Their places of labor were the schools and pulpits of Paris, Oxford, Cologne, Prague, and the cities of Provence, and their doctrinal signatures ranged from mystical union to rigorist poverty, from conciliar sovereignty to critiques of the Eucharist.

The context matters. The move of the papal court to Avignon in 1309, the conflict with the Franciscan Spirituals over evangelical poverty, and the Western Schism from 1378 to 1417 put questions of authority and sanctity front and center. Universities had matured into multinational enterprises where masters taught Lombard's Sentences and then wrote their own quaestiones and treatises. Urban lay movements like the Beguines or the devotio moderna sought intense forms of holiness. In this setting even traditional themes like poverty, causality, and union with God became flashpoints once they pressed against papal jurisdiction, sacramental orthodoxy, or the regulation of lay piety.

In the Rhineland, Meister Eckhart, born around 1260, served as a Dominican lector in Erfurt, master of theology in Paris in 1302, vicar in Thuringia, and preacher in Strasbourg and Cologne. His mystical theology taught detachment, the birth of the Word in the ground of the soul, and an apophatic grammar that pressed speech to the edge of paradox. After denunciations in Cologne, a process moved to Avignon; in 1329 a papal constitution condemned a set of his propositions as heretical or suspect. Eckhart had appealed and declared his loyalty to the faith, yet his language of indistinction, rightly nuanced in his own scheme, was judged dangerous in the market of preaching. His distinctive mark was a metaphysics of the soul's ground and an ethic of detachment ordered to union with God, preached in German to urban laity.

Close by in the francophone world, Marguerite Porete, a beguine from Hainaut, composed the Mirror of Simple Souls before 1306. She circulated the book despite local bans, and after a prolonged process was burned in Paris in 1310. Her text taught the annihilation of the will in divine love and the passage beyond the virtues for the soul that had arrived at simplicity. Church critics heard an antinomian echo associated with the Free Spirit. Porete's locale was the beguine milieu of the Low Countries and the Parisian tribunal; her doctrinal signature was a mystical perfectionism that seemed to loosen obligation to external precepts.

Within the Franciscan family, Peter of John Olivi, born in 1248, taught in Provence and Languedoc, and died in 1298 at Narbonne. He argued for usus pauper, the strict and poor use of things by friars, against any accommodation to comfortable living. He read history through Joachite lenses, seeing ages of the Spirit unfolding. His disciples in Languedoc cherished his writings. The Council of Vienne in 1311 to 1312 condemned propositions tied to the Spirituals and censured Beguine excesses. Later papal actions targeted Olivi's influence. Olivi's mark lay in an ethics of poverty sharpened to ascetic rigor and an apocalyptic sense of ecclesial reform.

The poverty fight expanded under William of Ockham, born around 1287, a Franciscan trained at Oxford. Summoned to Avignon in 1324, he sided with the Franciscan minister general Michael of Cesena against John XXII's rulings on poverty. In 1328 Ockham fled Avignon for the court of the emperor Louis IV in Munich. Ockham's philosophical distinctives included nominalism, a razor against needless entities, and the distinction of God's absolute and ordained power. Theologically and politically he limited papal claims, insisted that Scripture and right reason bound the church, and flirted with conciliar remedies. He was never condemned as a formal heretic, yet he was excommunicated and lived under imperial protection until his death in 1347. Ockham's places were Oxford, Avignon, and Munich; his signature combined anti curial polemic, a voluntarist account of divine power, and an epistemology wary of metaphysical extravagance.

Marsilius of Padua, a lay master and rector in Paris around 1313, wrote Defensor pacis in 1324. He argued that political sovereignty rests with the people, that the church's coercive power is a creature of the state, and that a general council represents the church over the papacy. John XXII condemned the book in 1327. Marsilius found refuge with Louis IV and died in Munich around 1342. His locales were Padua, Paris, and Munich, and his doctrinal signature was a juridical and conciliar theory that sharply subordinated ecclesiastical jurisdiction to civil authority.

The English scene formed another trajectory. John Wyclif, born around 1330, served as Oxford master and royal advisor. In De civili dominio in the late 1370s he taught that dominion is founded in grace, that sinful clerics hold property only de facto, and that the crown may lawfully seize corrupt church wealth. In De eucharistia in 1379 he denied transubstantiation and proposed a remanence view of Christ's presence. He also elevated Scripture as the ultimate norm, promoted vernacular preaching, and influenced the translation tradition in English. The London council of 1382 condemned his articles, and the Council of Constance in 1415 condemned 45 propositions and ordered his bones exhumed, which was carried out in 1428. Wyclif's places were Oxford and the royal court; his doctrinal signature combined dominion by grace, scriptural supremacy, and a critical Eucharistic doctrine.

Jan Hus carried Wyclif's program into Bohemia. Born around 1372, Hus studied and taught at Charles University in Prague, served as rector in 1409, and preached at Bethlehem Chapel. He attacked simony and indulgence trafficking, taught that Christ alone is the head of the church, and stressed the predestinate community of the saved. He championed preaching in Czech and later supported communion in both kinds for the laity, which became the badge of Utraquism. Summoned to the Council of Constance, he was condemned and burned in 1415. The Hussite movement then convulsed Bohemia, and the Compactata of Basel in 1436 allowed communion under both kinds in the kingdom. Hus's place was Prague and his signature was a moral and ecclesiological critique with a pastoral face.

One more Paris episode shows the bounds of allowable speculation. Nicholas of Autrecourt, active in the 1330s, pressed a skeptical line that denied necessary causal connections and undermined substantial forms. In 1346 a papal commission in Paris condemned his theses, and in 1347 he publicly recanted. While not a programmatic reformer, his views would unsettle accounts of sacramental causality and Aristotelian metaphysics central to scholastic theology. His place was the University of Paris and his signature was radical empiricism with corrosive effects on received doctrine.

Turning points punctuate this story. Vienne in 1311 to 1312 drew lines against Beguine and Spiritual innovations. Avignon and Cologne in 1329 censured Eckhart's language. Paris in 1346 fixed limits on skeptical epistemology. London in 1382 struck at Wycliffite teaching. Constance from 1414 to 1418 reasserted sacramental and ecclesiological norms against Wyclif and Hus and, ironically, also promoted conciliar superiority in its decrees. These formal acts channeled university creativity back into safer grooves yet left permanent challenges on the table.

Theologically, these figures reopened fundamental questions. How does one speak of union with God without collapsing creator and creature. How absolute is evangelical poverty and how does use differ from ownership. Where is the church located, in papal office, in a council, or in the body of the predestinate. How should Scripture, tradition, and scholastic reason interlock. What is the mode of Christ's presence in the Eucharist. What can human reason know about causality, and what does that mean for sacramental efficacy.

Reception and legacy were tangled. Eckhart's sermons seeded later German mysticism while his censured propositions warned preachers to hedge their metaphors. Porete's Mirror disappeared from attribution for centuries yet kept circulating under other names, a sign both of danger and of durable appeal. Olivi's usus pauper energized reforming Franciscan currents even as official actions suppressed Spiritual rigorism. Ockham's anti curial polemic armed later conciliarists and early modern constitutional theorists. Marsilius became a reference point for political subordination of clerical privilege. Wyclif's scripturalism and Eucharistic critique fed Lollardy in England and, through Prague, inspired Hus, whose martyrdom became the charter myth of a national church with Utraquist practice.

Across Europe, the places of these theologians match their fates. Oxford and Prague gave birth to reforming programs. Paris drew lines through condemnations. Avignon centralized judgment and provoked backlash. Munich became a haven for those who chose empire over papacy. The map shows that falling out of favor was not a single trajectory but a network of conflicts where doctrine, jurisdiction, and social reform met.

In sum, late medieval dissenters were not a single party but a gallery of teachers and preachers defined by locales and ideas that strained the capacities of the church to integrate novelty and zeal.
