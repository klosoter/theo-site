### ESSAY
Medieval Christians prayed and confessed with two questions pressing their conscience. How does God save sinners, and can any person on the way know they are safe in grace. Thomas Aquinas, writing in the 1260s and early 1270s, answered both with a rigor that wove Augustine, sacramental practice, and newly recovered Aristotle into one vision. He offered certainty that salvation is firmly wrought by God through Christ and the sacraments, yet he refused a certainty about the individual state of grace that would turn hope into presumption.

The background was set long before Aquinas. Augustine, in the early fifth century, argued against Pelagius that the initiative and efficacy of grace are divine. The Council of Orange in 529 guarded that conviction, affirming the necessity of prevenient grace and condemning semi-Pelagian drift. In the twelfth century, the Latin West systematized theology through Peter Lombard's Sentences, a textbook that gathered patristic judgments on grace, merit, and sacraments. Anselm's Cur Deus Homo, completed around 1098, shifted the analysis of atonement toward satisfaction and fit justice. Meanwhile, the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 mandated annual confession and communion, anchoring the penitential system in law and pastoral practice. All this met the thirteenth century revival of Aristotle, which gave theologians a language of causes, habits, and ends. Thomas, a Dominican born in 1225 and trained in Paris and Naples, wrote in this ferment, teaching at the University of Paris by 1256.

Aquinas's answer to how we are saved begins with God's predestinating wisdom. God moves creatures as first cause to their proper end, which for rational creatures is the vision of God. Grace is a created habit infused by God, a stable form in the soul that heals the wound of sin and elevates nature to a supernatural end. In his early work on Lombard's Sentences, and then in the Summa Theologiae drafted between 1265 and 1273, he describes justification as a real transformation, a passage from the state of sin to the state of grace. The efficient cause is God, the meritorious cause is Christ's Passion, the formal cause is habitual grace, whose form is charity, and the final cause is the glory of God and the salvation of the person. Faith is the beginning of salvation, yet for Aquinas faith justifies as formed by charity, fides caritate formata, so faith and love are internally united when grace is infused.

The cross is central. Christ, as head of the mystical body, merits salvation condignly for the whole Church, satisfying for sins in a way altogether sufficient. Here Thomas recasts Anselm's insight by bringing it inside a sacramental economy. The sacraments are instrumental causes that apply the power of the Passion to individuals. Baptism regenerates and remits all guilt and punishment due to sin. Penance restores the lapsed through contrition, confession, and satisfaction, an act that is reparative and medicinal rather than a commercial exchange. The Eucharist sustains the life of grace in those already united. Orders and matrimony serve the Church's common good and the propagation of life. The sacraments act ex opere operato, by the work worked, since their principal agent is Christ, yet they bear full fruit only in recipients disposed by faith and charity.

Human freedom is neither crushed nor autonomous. God's grace moves the will without coercing it, so that the person cooperates freely once elevated by grace. Aquinas distinguishes merit de condigno, strict merit under the order of charity that God promises to reward, from merit de congruo, a fittingness that God may accept by generosity. All genuine merit presupposes grace, and Christ's merit is the font of all human merit. Still, the believer really participates in the drama of sanctification, practicing the infused virtues and gifts and conforming to Christ.

On assurance Aquinas is at once pastoral and stern. He teaches that no one on pilgrimage can know with the certainty of faith that they are in grace, unless by special revelation. One can possess a moral and conjectural certainty based on signs, like the testimony of conscience, the sweetness of devotion, and the fruits of charity, yet such signs are fallible. Hope is thus not bare wish but a theological virtue that confidently leans on God's omnipotence and mercy for eternal life. It is at once certain with respect to its object, God who cannot fail, and uncertain with respect to the subject, the self who can fail. The opposite extremes are despair, which denies the reach of divine mercy, and presumption, which claims the prize without the race.

Final perseverance is pivotal. Thomas insists it is a distinct gift. A person may be in grace today and fall tomorrow unless God grants perseverance unto death. This gift, not owed to any creature, can and should be begged in prayer. The Church asks for perseverance when she prays lead us not into temptation. This stance protects humility while sustaining zeal. Spiritual progress is real and grace is trustworthy, but a person avoids complacency by relying finally on God's fidelity.

In all this Aquinas gives a profound synthesis. From Augustine he receives the primacy of grace and predestination. From Aristotle he borrows the analysis of habits, virtues, and causality. From ecclesial practice he draws the centrality of sacramental mediation. The result is a soteriology both metaphysical and sacramental, personal and ecclesial. Justification is more than a verdict, it is the healing and elevating influx of divine life. Assurance is more than a feeling, it is hope grounded in God and tested by charity, yet it is not an infallible knowledge about oneself before the end.

Turning to influence, Thomas consolidates the penitential and sacramental culture codified in 1215, offering confessors a coherent map of contrition, confession, absolution, and satisfaction. His account of merit and charity dignified ordinary Christian life, valorizing works of mercy, prayer, and ascetic struggle as genuine cooperation under grace. At the same time, the denial of absolute assurance for the ordinary believer helped foster a spirituality of vigilance, with emphasis on examination of conscience and repeated recourse to penance and the Eucharist.

Reception stretches beyond his lifetime, which ended in 1274. Late medieval debates on the will and grace, from John Duns Scotus in the early 1300s to the via moderna in the fifteenth century, sometimes rebalanced elements Thomas held in tension. The Reformation controversy sharpened the matter of assurance. Martin Luther, beginning in 1517, charged that medieval theology had obscured the gospel by binding assurance to the mutable quality of charity in the soul. The Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563 largely endorsed the Thomist line, affirming justification as renewal by grace and charity, the instrumental causality of the sacraments, the reality of condign merit under grace, and the rejection of infallible assurance apart from special revelation. Later movements like Jansenism claimed a stricter Augustinian cast, but even there the Thomist structure of nature elevated and grace infused remained a reference point.

How then are we saved, and who can have assurance. Aquinas answers that God saves through the merits of Christ, applied by the sacraments, infusing grace that heals and elevates, and drawing the will to cooperate in love. Assurance belongs to God before it belongs to us. The saints might be given a revelatory certainty. The rest live in the confident humility of hope, reading the signs of charity, practicing penance and the Eucharist, and praying for the gift of perseverance until the end. In that register, his soteriology is an ordered hymn to divine primacy that guards human participation without surrendering the last word to the self.
