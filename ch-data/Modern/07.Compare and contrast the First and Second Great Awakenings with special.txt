### ESSAY
The phrase Great Awakening names more than a burst of fervor. It marks public contests over how God acts, how people change, and how a nation orders its moral life. The First Great Awakening in the 1730s and 1740s and the Second Great Awakening from the 1790s into the 1830s shared a grammar of conversion and preaching, yet they unfolded in different political worlds and produced different social architectures. The question is not whether both were revivals, but how their contrasting settings and theologies shaped their effects.

The First Great Awakening arose within the British Atlantic. New England congregational establishments were still in force. Anglican structures dominated the South. The Enlightenment sharpened moral reasoning and religious critique, and imperial print connected pulpits across the ocean. In that frame, the Northampton revival of 1734 to 1735 under Jonathan Edwards provided a template. Edwards described a surge of conviction and consolation in A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God, published in London in 1737, and he defended the reality of spiritual affections while warning against frenzy. The arrival of George Whitefield in 1739 changed scale. Whitefield preached to thousands in fields from Philadelphia to Boston during 1739 to 1741, coordinated with Scottish and English allies, and used the press with rare skill. John Wesley, though not resident in the colonies after 1737, modeled field preaching and Methodist organization, and his followers amplified the revivalist idiom.

The First Awakening produced a battle over church authority. Gilbert Tennent's sermon The Danger of an Unconverted Ministry in 1740 charged that unregenerate clergy blocked the gospel. New England Old Lights, including Charles Chauncy of Boston, argued that noise and visions were not marks of grace. Presbyterians divided between Old Side and New Side in 1741, then reunited in 1758 after tempers cooled and institutions grew. Edwards tried to discipline revivalism. His Religious Affections in 1746 argued that true religion resides in a transformed heart, tested by enduring love and obedience, not by bodily agitations. Yet his own pastorate at Northampton ended in 1750 after disputes over admission to the Lord's Supper. The revival's energy yielded new colleges, including the College of New Jersey in 1746, later Princeton, which trained New Light ministers and sustained a transatlantic evangelical network.

The Second Great Awakening took shape in a new nation. Disestablishment after 1776 shifted religion from state support to voluntary consent. Westward migration spread scattered communities that needed flexible forms of ministry. The market revolution and the rise of party politics in the 1820s created both anxiety and opportunity. Revival answered to these conditions. Two streams converged. In New England and on college campuses, Timothy Dwight's presidency at Yale from 1795 fostered pastoral catechesis and campus awakenings, notably in 1802. In the West and South, camp meetings appeared around 1800, with Cane Ridge, Kentucky, in August 1801 as the emblem, drawing many thousands for days of preaching, singing, and communal exhortation. Barton W Stone and the nascent Cumberland Presbyterians exemplified a plain style suited to frontier conditions.

In the 1820s and 1830s, Charles Grandison Finney systematized revival. Converted in 1821, trained in law, and ordained in 1824, Finney preached throughout upstate New York, the burned over district, and in cities like Rochester, where the 1830 to 1831 revivals became a model. His New Measures included protracted meetings, the anxious bench, public naming of the impenitent, and organized lay visitation. His Lectures on Revivals of Religion in 1835 argued that revivals flow from the right use of means because God's moral government treats humans as capable of obedience. Lyman Beecher and other New Englanders blended Calvinist language with strategic use of voluntary societies. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions began in 1810, the American Bible Society in 1816, the American Tract Society in 1825, and the American Temperance Society in 1826. Women formed maternal associations, supported missions, and organized Sabbath schools. African American Christians founded independent institutions, including Richard Allen's African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1816. Baptists and Methodists, with lay leadership and circuit systems, became the largest Protestant bodies by mid century.

The theological contrasts were decisive. The First Awakening remained fundamentally Calvinist. Edwards stressed sovereign grace, the new birth as God's work, and a disciplined discernment of the Spirit's fruits. The revival validated intense experience, but it did not make human volition the cause of regeneration. The Second Awakening, while diverse, tilted toward Arminian or modified Calvinist accounts. Finney rejected original sin as moral inability and taught that sinners must and can repent now. He emphasized sanctification as real obedience, which led to Oberlin perfectionism in the 1840s. John Wesley's doctrine of Christian perfection, articulated in sermons and conferences in the 1760s and 1770s, supplied a longer pedigree for holiness emphases. New Divinity thinkers like Samuel Hopkins and Nathaniel Emmons, heirs of Edwards, crafted a moral government Calvinism that prized disinterested benevolence and fueled anti slavery convictions.

The turning points show how each awakening resolved its tensions. In the 1740s, backlash against excess, the 1741 Presbyterian split, and the dismissal of Edwards in 1750 checked the revival and pushed its energy into education and missionary societies within a still imperial framework. In the 1830s, the Rochester revivals crowned a wave of urban evangelism, while controversies over doctrine and strategy helped fracture Presbyterians into Old School and New School in 1837 and 1838. The Plan of Union of 1801, which had allowed Congregationalists and Presbyterians to cooperate in the West, was repudiated amid those divisions. Frontier revivalism boiled over into new movements, including the Restorationist impulse of Stone and Thomas Campbell, the rise of Adventism under William Miller in the late 1830s and the crisis of 1844, and the emergence of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints under Joseph Smith in 1830. Meanwhile moral reform surged. Temperance flourished in the 1820s. Evangelicals debated slavery, with growing abolitionist leadership among New England and Midwestern networks and hardening proslavery defenses in the South. Denominational rupture followed, including the Methodist split in 1844 and the Southern Baptist formation in 1845.

What, then, of effects. Both awakenings democratized piety by privileging conversion, lay testimony, and mass preaching. Both widened the religious public sphere through print, itinerancy, and intercolonial or interstate networks. The First Awakening reconfigured learned Protestantism within the empire, secured transatlantic correspondence, and founded colleges that would supply ministers for a century. It sharpened debates over ministerial authority, sacramental admission, and the discernment of spirits. Its cultural mood remained clerical, introspective, and doctrinally anchored. The Second Awakening reconfigured American civil society. It crowned voluntarism as the normal mode of church life, created national benevolent societies, sacralized domestic influence through the ideal of the Christian home, and tied revival to social reform. It built an evangelical consensus that set the terms of moral discourse in the antebellum republic. It also generated centrifugal innovations and sectarian proliferation on the frontier. If the First made revival intellectually respectable and institutionally stable, the Second made it programmatic, national, and reformist.

The two awakenings stand together as stages in the making of American evangelicalism, the first a transatlantic theological renovation, the second a national mobilization for souls and society.
