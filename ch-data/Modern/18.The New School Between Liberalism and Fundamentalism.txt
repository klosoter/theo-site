### ESSAY
Begin with a tension. The New School party in nineteenth century American Presbyterianism helped build the revivalist evangelical nation, yet its own institutions and ideas later fed the rise of modernist liberal theology. At the same time, the very revival methods it championed became the stock in trade of early fundamentalists. The relation is not linear, it is braided. The New School stood between Old School confessionalism and the modern options of liberalism and fundamentalism, and it transmitted impulses to both.

Context first. The Second Great Awakening, roughly 1790s through 1830s, reshaped American Protestantism through itinerant preaching, anxious seats, and voluntary societies. The Plan of Union of 1801 yoked Presbyterians and Congregationalists in frontier missions, producing mixed polities and cooperative church planting. Out of that milieu rose New England Theology, a creative Edwardsean tradition that modified classical Calvinism. Nathaniel W Taylor of Yale, 1786-1858, argued in his Concio ad Clerum of 1828 for moral ability, that sinners have a natural power to obey, and for a moral government theory of atonement. Charles G Finney, 1792-1875, a lawyer turned evangelist, popularized new measures, the anxious bench, protracted meetings, and perfectionist expectations, and wrote Lectures on Revivals of Religion in 1835. Lyman Beecher, 1775-1863, and Albert Barnes, 1798-1870, embodied this reform minded, revival friendly wing within Presbyterianism.

Opposition gathered among Old School Presbyterians. Charles Hodge, 1797-1878, of Princeton, trained in German exegesis yet wary of rationalist dilution, insisted on strict subscription to the Westminster standards and on the imputation of Adamic guilt and the penal substitution of Christ. The General Assembly in 1837 abrogated the Plan of Union and expelled synods shaped by Congregational cooperation. The Old School New School split unfolded in 1837-1838, with New School leaders defending revival methods, modify Calvinist formulations, and broader evangelical cooperation. Barnes had already been tried for heresy in 1836 for his Notes on Romans and his views of imputation, which shows the theological fault lines at work.

From that point to the Civil War, New School Presbyterians built an expansive evangelical infrastructure. They partnered across denominational lines in the American Home Missionary Society and the American Board, backed colleges like Oberlin founded 1833 under Asa Mahan and later led by Finney, and pressed moral reforms including temperance and abolition. The party itself fractured in 1857 over slavery, producing New School North and New School South. After the war, the New School North reunited with the Old School North in 1869, a crucial event shaped by mediating theologians like Henry Boynton Smith, 1815-1877, of Union Theological Seminary in New York. Smith welcomed historical study and German thought while arguing for adherence to the system of doctrine rather than to every proposition of the standards.

Through this New School channel, a path opened toward liberal Protestantism. Union Seminary, founded in 1836 with New School sympathies, became a home for critical methods. Smith and colleagues translated and digested Schleiermacher and Ritschl, introduced students to historical consciousness, and taught a generous subscription to confessions. William G T Shedd, 1820-1894, trained in New School circles, eventually moved toward Old School confessionalism and wrote Dogmatic Theology in 1888-1894, a move that illustrates how fluid the boundary remained. Yet the dominant institutional line bent toward modernism. Charles A Briggs, 1841-1913, delivered his 1891 inaugural address on the authority of Holy Scripture at Union, advocating higher criticism and multiple channels of authority, and he was suspended by the Presbyterian General Assembly in 1892. Union severed its formal Presbyterian tie in the aftermath, and the seminary became a flagship of Protestant liberalism. That trajectory owed much to the New School ethos of engagement with contemporary learning and a looser confessional posture.

There was a New England link as well. Through the Plan of Union and shared personnel, New School Presbyterians were neighbors to Congregationalist innovators like Horace Bushnell, 1802-1876, whose Christian Nurture of 1847 and moral influence emphasis anticipated the ethical religion of the later Social Gospel. New School pulpits and periodicals made room for this rhetoric of character and culture. By the 1890s, many New School associated clergy in the reunited Presbyterian Church supported higher criticism, social reform, and mediating doctrines that leaned liberal.

The other line points toward fundamentalism, yet the relation is different. Doctrinally, fundamentalism drew from Old School resources. The Niagara Bible Conference, 1878-1897, the Warfield and A A Hodge volume on Inspiration and Authority in 1881, the General Assembly deliverances of 1910 and 1916 on the virgin birth and other essentials, and J Gresham Machens Christianity and Liberalism in 1923, all stand in the Old School tradition of precise doctrine and confessional integrity. Fundamentalists rejected Taylorite moral government, Finneyite perfectionism, and Barnes style imputation revisions. They defended penal substitution, original sin, and inerrancy.

Yet in methods and networks, fundamentalism harvested New School fruits. D L Moody, 1837-1899, made mass evangelism a science in the 1870s and 1880s. He borrowed Finneys inquiry room, used choirs and lay workers, and built voluntary institutions like the Moody Bible Institute in 1886. R A Torrey and Billy Sunday carried this style into the early twentieth century. Their conferences, Bible institutes, and citywide campaigns relied on the voluntary society model the New School had perfected. Interdenominational cooperation around a few doctrinal essentials, a hallmark of New School evangelicalism, became a core strategy of fundamentalist organization, even as the list of essentials narrowed to anti modernist planks. The Fundamentals, a set of essays published from 1910 to 1915, were distributed through those same voluntary networks, not through presbyterial courts.

Turning points reveal the branching. The 1837 split established a party that normalized looser subscription and revivalist pragmatism. The 1869 reunion blended New School breadth with Old School structures, exporting New School habits into the whole denomination. The 1892 Briggs case forced a choice about critical scholarship, and the decision to discipline him pressed Union Seminary down an independent liberal path. The 1910 deliverance and the 1920s Presbyterian fights, including the reorganization of Princeton in 1929 and Machens withdrawal to form Westminster Seminary, recreated in a new key the older Old School New School contest, but now the poles were fundamentalist and modernist. In each moment, New School culture either supplied the institutional door for liberalism or the evangelistic tools used by fundamentalists.

Theologically, the New School altered soteriology and ecclesiology in ways that mattered. Moral ability and a governmental atonement emphasized persuasion, ethical transformation, and the will. That resonated with later liberal emphases on character and the Kingdom of God as moral order. Looser subscription stressed the system rather than the letter, creating elasticity that welcomed fresh ideas, for good or ill. Revivalist pragmatism and social reform forged habits of practical coalition building and trust in techniques, which later fundamentalists deployed with a different doctrinal core. New School reception of German historical study prioritized history and experience, furnishing liberalism with a Presbyterian pathway.

Reception and legacy are therefore mixed. Old School critics long charged that the New School was a gateway to modernism. Liberal historians credited New School leaders with healing Calvinism for a democratic age and opening Protestantism to science and criticism. Evangelical historians have often distinguished Finneys methods, which proved durable, from his theology, which became a foil. Today, one can trace two living lineages. The modern mainline Presbyterian ethos of inclusive subscription, social engagement, and critical scholarship carries New School DNA. The methods and parachurch infrastructure of conservative evangelicalism and fundamentalism, from conferences to Bible institutes, also carry New School DNA, even as their doctrinal polemics stand firmly with the Old School.

In short, the New School did not simply sit midway between liberalism and fundamentalism, it furnished liberalism with an institutional and theological bridge and furnished fundamentalism with its evangelistic machinery.
