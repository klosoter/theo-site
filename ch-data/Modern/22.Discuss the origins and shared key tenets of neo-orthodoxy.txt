### ESSAY
Neo-orthodoxy entered the scene as a thunderclap after 1914, when the catastrophe of the Great War shattered the serene self-confidence of late nineteenth century Protestant theology. The guiding question that stirred a generation was blunt and theological to the core. If human culture has failed so spectacularly, on what ground can the church speak of God with truth and power. The reply of neo-orthodoxy was a return to the primacy of divine revelation and to the living Word that judges and rescues human projects. This was a new orthodoxy in tone and method, not a mere repristination of old confessions, and it sought to speak biblically and critically to modernity in crisis.

The background is essential. Nineteenth century liberal Protestantism, shaped by Schleiermacher, born 1768, died 1834, and Ritschl, born 1822, died 1889, located faith within experience, moral value, and the history of religions. Theological method leaned on historicism, on the comparative study of texts, and on the confidence that human moral progress and the Kingdom of God would converge. In 1914 many German professors signed manifestos celebrating national war aims, and pulpits rang with patriotic sermons. The slaughter in trenches from 1914 to 1918, followed by economic turbulence and cultural disarray, cut the nerve of liberal optimism. Theologically, a vast distance seemed to open between God and the human subject. The easy traffic back and forth between culture and faith could no longer be presumed.

Karl Barth, born 1886, died 1968, articulated the rupture with unusual force. As a Swiss pastor in Safenwil he preached to factory workers and read Romans with fresh eyes during the war years. His commentary on Romans appeared in 1919, with a revolutionary second edition in 1922. It declared the sovereignty of the divine Word, the priority of revelation over religion, and the utter transcendence of God who is wholly other. Barth spoke of a divine No that judges human righteousness and a divine Yes of grace in Jesus Christ. Alongside Barth were companions in what came to be called dialectical theology. The journal Zwischen den Zeiten, issued from 1922 to 1933, linked voices such as Emil Brunner, born 1889, died 1966, and Friedrich Gogarten, born 1887, died 1967.

Brunner traveled similar terrain, though he was more open to points of contact between revelation and human reason. His work Experience, Knowledge, and Faith, 1921, pressed the issue of how God becomes known, and Revelation and Reason, 1932, sought to order theology without surrendering to rationalism. The debate tightened in 1934 when Brunner published Nature and Grace, arguing that a vestige of capacity for God remains in humanity. Barth answered with the pamphlet titled Nein, a thundering refusal to grant natural theology any ground in the doctrine of revelation. The dispute exposed a shared center all the same. Both men rejected the liberal historicist method as a foundation and insisted that God is known only by God, through the action of the Word and Spirit.

Rudolf Bultmann, born 1884, died 1976, stood at the crossroads of exegesis and theology. He applied form criticism to the New Testament, insisted on demythologization as a task in 1941, and claimed that the message, the kerygma, calls decision in the present. Bultmann shared with Barth the conviction that revelation is event and that the New Testament is witness rather than a warehouse of timeless ideas. Yet his alignment with Heideggerian existence and his method of myth interpretation set him apart from stricter neo-orthodox dogmatics. Still, in the broader sense of crisis theology, Bultmann belongs to the same family conversation about the Word of God in a modern context.

The political upheavals of the 1930s provided a further crucible. The rise of the German Christian movement under National Socialism sought to align the church with racial ideology. In 1934 Barth guided the drafting of the Theological Declaration of Barmen, adopted by the Confessing Church. It proclaimed that Jesus Christ, as attested in Scripture, is the one Word of God whom we are to hear and trust, so that no other events, powers, or rulers may claim that place. Barmen anchored neo-orthodox convictions in ecclesial resistance. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, born 1906, executed 1945, pressed discipleship, community, and costly grace, in Discipleship, 1937, and Letters and Papers from Prison, composed 1943 to 1945. He shared the movement's Christocentrism and its suspicion of cultural religion, while weaving ethics and ecclesiology into a life of confession.

After the war, Barth resumed his magnum opus, Church Dogmatics, published from 1932 to 1967. There he elaborated a theology of the Word of God, a doctrine of election centered on Christ, a robust account of sin and reconciliation, and a doctrine of the church grounded in witness. The watchwords were clear. Revelation comes by grace, not by nature. Scripture is the creaturely witness that God uses to speak. Christ is the center of all dogmatics, the One in whom election and covenant are fulfilled. Analogia fidei, the analogy of faith, replaces analogia entis, the analogy of being. Human nature is not a bridge to God, and theology must proceed from God's address to us.

The shared tenets of neo-orthodoxy crystallized through these debates and texts. First, the primacy of revelation. God is subject, not object, and theology follows the initiative of God's self speaking. This conviction took the triadic form of the Word of God. Jesus Christ is the Word in person. Scripture is the prophetic and apostolic witness. Preaching is the Word in proclamation. Second, the transcendence and freedom of God. God is not an extension of human ideals, and any attempt to fold theology into culture produces religion without God. Third, a chastened anthropology. Sin is radical, often seen as pride and self assertion, and history confirms the bondage of the will. Reinhold Niebuhr, born 1892, died 1971, expounded this in Moral Man and Immoral Society, 1932, and in The Nature and Destiny of Man, 1941 to 1943, where he argued that collective egoism outstrips individual morality, thus requiring realistic politics and grace. Fourth, Christocentrism. In Barth especially, election is reconfigured so that Christ is both the electing God and the elected man, the one in whom divine judgment and mercy meet for the world's salvation. Fifth, an eschatological tempo. Revelation breaks in from God's future, and the church lives by hope amid crisis.

A sixth shared element was methodological. Neo-orthodox thinkers welcomed historical criticism as a tool yet refused to let method dictate message. Bultmann exemplified this tension from the exegetical side, Barth from the dogmatic side. Both insisted that faith responds to the Word's address rather than to the mastery of data. Seventh, church and witness. The church exists to hear and proclaim, to confess in public when the gods of the age demand loyalty. Barmen 1934 stands as a monument to this calling.

Turning points in the story are legible. The publication of Romans in 1919 and especially 1922 marks the rhetorical birth of the movement. The journal Zwischen den Zeiten formed a school in the 1920s. The Brunner Barth exchange in 1934 defined the boundary with natural theology. Barmen in 1934 bound doctrine to resistance under tyranny. Bultmann's program in 1941 sharpened debates about Scripture and proclamation. Postwar, Barth's Dogmatics provided a cathedral for the movement's claims, while American neo-orthodoxy in the Niebuhrs translated its realism into ethics and public theology.

Theologically, neo-orthodoxy mattered because it re anchored Protestant thought in God's act and address. It refused the captivity of theology to the modern subject, yet it did not flee into repristinated scholasticism. Instead it forged a grammar of revelation that could speak judgment and gospel into a disenchanted world. It reoriented exegesis around kerygma, reoriented ethics around sin and grace, and reoriented ecclesiology around witness.

Reception was mixed and fertile. Roman Catholic theologians criticized the rejection of analogia entis, yet also found in Barth a serious interlocutor. Evangelical Protestants received Barth's stress on Scripture and Christ, while worrying over his view of biblical authority. Radical theologians in the 1960s accused neo-orthodoxy of reinstating metaphysical authority, while postliberal theologians later adopted its narrative and ecclesial focus with different accents. Ecumenically, its focus on the Word fueled the Faith and Order movement and helped shape the World Council of Churches in 1948.

By the 1960s the movement no longer held the center, yet its core tenets continued to structure debate. The claim that God speaks, the caution about human projects, the insistence on Christ at the center, and the confidence that the church exists to confess, all these forged a durable legacy. Neo-orthodoxy began with a cry from the abyss of war and ended as a school that re taught the church how to hear, to judge, and to hope.

In sum, neo-orthodoxy arose from crisis and consolidated around revelation and Christ, giving modern theology a grammar sturdy enough to tell the truth.
