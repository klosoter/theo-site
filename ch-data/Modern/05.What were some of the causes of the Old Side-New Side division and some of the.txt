### ESSAY
The Old Side-New Side rupture within colonial American Presbyterianism opened as a family quarrel over zeal and order, and it closed with a programmatic peace that shaped the denomination's character for generations. The question pressed by the First Great Awakening was whether the church could honor the primacy of experiential piety while preserving the bonds of a confessional and disciplined communion. Between 1729 and 1758, the Presbyterian Church in the middle colonies forged a settlement that balanced subscription to doctrine, ordered governance, and revivalist energy.

The prelude came with the Adopting Act of 1729, a compromise hammered out in the Synod of Philadelphia. Ministers were to subscribe to the Westminster Confession and Catechisms as containing the system of doctrine taught in Scripture. Scruples could be declared, and presbyteries would judge whether any exception struck at the essentials of that system. The Act gave the American church a constitutional center while granting measured liberty. Even in the 1730s, however, this arrangement carried strain. Scots-Irish ministers and elders arrived with strong habits of presbyterial order, while many New Englanders brought a revivalist temper shaped by the legacy of experiential conversion. The Log College at Neshaminy, founded by William Tennent Sr. in the late 1720s, trained earnest preachers who were often unevenly schooled in the classical curriculum prized by Old World universities. The question of what counted as adequate ministerial preparation and who had authority to decide it soon came to the fore.

The Great Awakening heightened every tension. George Whitefield's tours in 1739-1741 stirred mass conversions and challenged settled pastoral patterns. Gilbert Tennent, the most famous of the Log College men, pressed the issue with his incendiary sermon and pamphlet of 1740, The Danger of an Unconverted Ministry. He implied that many ministers lacked saving grace, and he defended itinerant preaching across presbyterial lines as necessary for the cure of souls. Revival techniques multiplied, including lay exhortation, extended sacramental seasons, and emotionally intense preaching that aimed to bring hearers to crisis and consolation.

Old Side leaders, including Robert Cross and other clergy in Philadelphia, did not reject genuine revival. They feared, however, that unchecked itinerancy and indiscriminate judgment of ministers would erode presbyterial authority, unsettle congregations, and invite enthusiasm. The Synod's minutes from 1738 record formal attempts to restrain ministers from preaching in another man's charge without invitation. The creation of the Presbytery of New Brunswick in 1738 consolidated the revival party and sharpened lines. New Brunswick licensed men whom Old Side presbyteries deemed insufficiently trained, and it encouraged preaching tours that ignored jurisdictional boundaries. The controversy thus mixed issues of education, polity, and pastoral theology with the heat of an ongoing revival.

The break came in 1741. At the Synod of Philadelphia, the Old Side secured a Protestation that effectively excluded the New Brunswick men unless they acceded to tighter controls. The New Side ministers refused, and the assembly fractured. Over the next few years, New Side congregations strengthened their own structures, creating the Synod of New York in 1745, while the Old Side continued as the Synod of Philadelphia. Both synods claimed fidelity to Westminster standards and Presbyterian polity. They differed over the prudential application of subscription, the legitimacy of Log College training, the regulation of itinerants, and the tone of pastoral practice.

In the divided 1740s, notable developments continued on both sides. New Side leaders built institutions to sustain their vision. The College of New Jersey was chartered in 1746 to provide educated, evangelical ministers. Jonathan Dickinson served as its first president in 1747, Aaron Burr Sr. followed in 1748, Samuel Davies in 1759, Samuel Finley in 1761, and John Witherspoon in 1768. The school fused classical learning with a commitment to the doctrines of grace and a warm evangelical piety, anchoring the New Side's aspiration for learned godliness. Meanwhile, the revival widened Presbyterian witness, especially in the South. Samuel Davies, licensed in 1746 and active in Virginia from 1747, combined powerful preaching with deft negotiation of religious toleration, securing meeting licenses and nurturing a disciplined piety under adverse conditions.

The heat of controversy cooled as the awakening waned in the later 1740s. Extremes had discredited themselves. New Side leaders moved to regularize education and discipline. Old Side clergy saw that revival had refreshed many churches and that the denomination risked long term loss if it remained divided. By the early 1750s, informal cooperation and concrete overtures prepared the ground for reunion. Negotiations ripened into the Plan of Union adopted in 1758, which merged the Synod of New York and the Synod of Philadelphia into a single Synod of New York and Philadelphia.

The 1758 terms achieved more than a handshake. They reaffirmed the Adopting Act of 1729 as the standard of ministerial subscription to the Westminster system of doctrine. They recognized the reality of true revival, while rejecting censorious rhetoric and irregular intrusions into settled congregations. They set rules for itinerancy, requiring consent of local ministers and sessions, yet leaving room for broader evangelistic labor. They insisted on proper education for candidates, without dictating a single school, thereby legitimating the College of New Jersey while leaving other avenues open. They called for fraternal respect between parties and created synodical procedures to adjudicate disputes. In short, the reunion constitutionalized a confessional evangelical identity, binding zeal to order.

The theological and intellectual significance of this settlement was considerable. First, the church endorsed system subscription rather than strict article by article subscription, a stance with deep roots in 1729 and renewed in 1758. This approach protected the core of Reformed orthodoxy while allowing responsible latitude over nonessential points. Second, the church affirmed experiential religion as a vital mark of ministry and membership, yet placed it under ecclesial discipline. The longing for conversion, assurance, and sanctification was not to be quenched, but it must be taught and shepherded within a confessional and presbyterial framework. Third, the church clarified jurisdiction. Pastors owed respect to the boundaries of parishes and presbyteries, but those structures existed to advance the gospel, not to frustrate it. Fourth, the church recognized the need for indigenous institutions. The College of New Jersey became a pipeline for trained clergy committed to both doctrine and godliness, a model that would flow into later seminaries.

Reception and legacy confirmed the wisdom of the settlement. The reunited synod grew rapidly in numbers and reach. The methods refined in the 1750s were carried into the national structures created after independence. The denomination adopted a Form of Government in 1788 and constituted a General Assembly in 1789, building on synodical habits learned in the reunion. The missionary thrust to the South and the frontier advanced, not least through alumni of the College of New Jersey. The balance of confessional integrity and evangelical warmth that marked the 1758 union shaped American Presbyterian identity into the nineteenth century. It also left unresolved tensions that would resurface in the Old School-New School division of 1837-1869, where issues of theology, revival methods, and ecclesial oversight reappeared in a new key. Yet the fact that the 1758 peace held for nearly eight decades testified to the durability of the confessional evangelical synthesis.

In sum, the Old Side-New Side split grew from disputes over subscription, education, itinerancy, and revival, and the 1758 reunion forged a disciplined evangelical Presbyterianism that equipped the church for expansion, institution building, and national organization.
