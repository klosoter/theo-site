### ESSAY
The word revival carried two distinct gravities in the modern Anglo American church. For Jonathan Edwards in the 1730s and 1740s it was a surprising work of God, a sovereign intensification of ordinary grace that no human could schedule. For Charles Finney in the 1820s and 1830s it was the predictable result of wise use of appointed means, a harvest where the field had been properly plowed. The tension between these visions runs through two centuries of evangelical practice and remains the old fault line under modern awakenings.

Edwards rose amid the First Great Awakening that crested between 1739 and 1742, though his own congregation at Northampton experienced a wave already in 1734 to 1735. In 1737 he published A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God, a transatlantic report that offered dates, numbers, and pastoral observations in sober prose. In 1741, as itinerants like George Whitefield stirred New England, Edwards preached Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God at Enfield, yet his larger project was not fiery declamation but careful discernment. Distinguishing Marks of a Work of the Spirit of God in 1741 weighed the phenomena, arguing that bodily agitations, public noise, or sudden impressions were neither proof nor disproof of grace. Some Thoughts Concerning the Present Revival in 1742 defended the awakening against its cultured despisers while admitting real disorders. Religious Affections in 1746 then set his most enduring standard. True religion, he argued, consists in holy affections rooted in a new spiritual sense, yielding durable humility, love, and obedience. The marks are ethical and God centered, not merely sensory or suggestive.

Finney emerged in a changed nation. Disestablishment after 1776, the Market Revolution, and the spread of voluntary societies reconfigured the religious sphere. Converted in 1821 in Adams, New York, and licensed to preach in 1824, he began campaigns across upstate New York, a region later labeled the Burned Over District for its repeated conflagrations of revival. Rochester in 1830 to 1831 was the emblem. Judges adjourned courts, shops closed at noon, and hundreds professed repentance. In 1835 he published Lectures on Revivals of Religion, a manual for pastors and lay leaders that treated revival as an outcome of cause and effect. The Spirit was sovereign in moral suasion, yet the pastor was responsible to remove obstacles, press truth, and secure decision. New measures, like the anxious bench for public seekers, protracted meetings across many nights, naming sinners in sermons, and direct appeals for immediate choices, were not gimmicks to Finney. They were means appointed by common sense and urged by Scripture to awaken conscience and bend the will.

The contrast begins with doctrines of God and man. Edwards, formed by Augustinian and Reformed convictions, held that new birth is a supernatural renovation of the heart. No one can produce it by method. Human efforts are real but they are instruments of a divine initiative. He called for faithful preaching, intense prayer, pastoral discipline, and careful catechesis, and he insisted that God ordinarily blesses the means of grace. But revival for him remains a visitation. He called it a surprising work. He watched its ebb and flow with awe and trembling, forbidding ministers to manufacture effects or to confound animal spirits with grace. The affections could be strong, even ecstatic, yet their truth is known by their fruit over time.

Finney, taught by legal training and influenced by New England moral government thought, framed the gospel in terms of obligation and choice. He denied that sinners are unable to repent in any strict sense. Their inability is moral, not natural. Since law obligates only where ability exists, the Spirit works by truth presented to the mind, not by physical regeneration. Thus revival is not a miracle in the strict order of nature. It is a predictable moral result. If Christians pray, if preaching is clear and confrontational, if the church removes hindrances like pride and formality, God stands ready to bless. Finney could say that revivals have laws as sure as harvest follows plowing. He did not mean that God is absent. He meant that God binds himself to promised methods.

This divergence produced characteristic pastoral strategies. Edwards probed the heart, directed souls to the beauty of the Lord, and watched for signs of counterfeit zeal. When James Davenport led disruptive meetings and bonfires of clothing and books in 1743, Edwards rebuked the disorder and defended sober joy. He urged a long view, tracking whether love to God and neighbor, submission to Scripture, and perseverance in holiness marked a convert. He also tied revival to the regimen of a gathered church. Late in his Northampton pastorate he insisted on regenerate church membership and came to reject the open communion policy of his grandfather Solomon Stoddard. That conflict led to his dismissal in 1750, a lesson in the cost of principled pastoral rule during awakening. Yet in Stockbridge from 1751 until his death in 1758, he wrote his philosophical and theological works that grounded his revival theology in a deep metaphysic of divine beauty and consent.

Finney designed the meeting itself as an engine of decision. The anxious bench functioned as a public space where the undecided were called to come forward. Protracted meetings created sustained pressure across repeated nights. He used inquiry rooms, he enlisted women to pray in mixed gatherings, and he made public renunciation of sin a norm. Many older ministers objected. Old School Presbyterians like Charles Hodge at Princeton charged him with Pelagian tendencies and with producing shallow professions. New School leaders were more sympathetic, reading the new measures as contextual adaptation. The Presbyterian schism of 1837 to 1838 framed these disputes, as Old School and New School split over theology, polity, and methods, revival among the issues. Finney took his program to Oberlin College from 1835 onward, serving as professor and then president between 1851 and 1866. At Oberlin he developed a doctrine of Christian perfection, a state of entire consecration possible in this life. That teaching linked revival to evangelical reform, including abolition and temperance, and it further hardened confessional critics.

On the question of discernment, Edwards and Finney deployed different tests. Edwards asked, Does this movement magnify Christ as divine redeemer, promote esteem for Scripture, humble the soul, and yield durable obedience. The test is theological and ethical over months and years. Finney watched for moral transformation but counted immediate decision as decisive. He measured a meeting by the number of public resolves and the breadth of social impact. Where Edwards worried that fear or crowd psychology could mimic grace, Finney aimed to harness those very dynamics for righteous ends.

Their views of history also parted ways but with a shared hope. Edwards was postmillennial in a reflective key. He envisioned the gospel advancing through special effusions of the Spirit that would crest in global blessing. He mapped revivals in history to argue that God runs history by seasons of mercy, as in his later essay on the history of redemption. Finney was postmillennial in an activist key. He believed that widespread obedience, secured by revival and reform, could usher in the millennium. The world for him could be improved by organized moral effort under revived churches.

Reception traced the fault line. Edwards became the textbook for later evangelical self critique. Eighteenth century Anglican and Congregational critics used his distinctions to police fanaticism, while nineteenth century Edwardseans such as Samuel Hopkins and Joseph Bellamy expanded his moral themes into the New Divinity, debating disinterested benevolence and the nature of true virtue. Finney became the exemplar of democratic revivalism. Methodists and Baptists adapted versions of his measures, from the altar call to camp meetings. Critics warned that technique would displace truth and that numbers would eclipse nurture. Defenders answered that conscience must be addressed and that delay is deadly. The result was a durable two track model of evangelical renewal, one gravitating to theological depth and patient formation, the other to urgent appeal and organizational savvy.

Both men sought the glory of God in the salvation of sinners, both believed in the necessity of prayer, both revered Scripture, and both preached the cross with moral earnestness. Yet their accounts of causality and their pastoral instincts diverged deeply. Edwards guarded the mystery of spiritual life and treated revival as a divine wind that humans can neither command nor bottle. Finney treated the same wind as constant, waiting for sails to be raised by human obedience and practical wisdom. The choice between them still frames the modern evangelical conscience.
