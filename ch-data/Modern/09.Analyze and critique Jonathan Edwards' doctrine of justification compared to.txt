### ESSAY
The tension is familiar. On the one hand, the Reformed confessions fix justification as a courtroom verdict grounded in the imputed righteousness of Christ, received by faith alone. On the other hand, Jonathan Edwards, preaching in Northampton in 1734 and again through the awakenings of 1739 to 1742, describes faith with an intense psychology of the heart, a new sense of divine excellency, and a union with Christ that carries moral texture. Does his way of speaking preserve the confessional plumb line, or does it slide toward a moralized account of acceptance with God

To set the scene, the confessional baseline had been established long before Edwards was born in 1703. The Belgic Confession of 1561 declares that we are justified by faith alone, not on account of any value in faith itself, but because it receives Christ and his merits. The Heidelberg Catechism of 1563 answers in Question 60 that God grants and imputes to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ, as if I had never had nor committed any sin, granted by faith alone. The Second Helvetic Confession of 1566 denies infused righteousness as the ground of acceptance. The Westminster Confession, framed in 1646 at the Assembly that met from 1643 to 1649, seals the grammar in chapter 11. God justifies the ungodly. He does not infuse righteousness. He imputes Christ obedience and satisfaction to them, and they receive and rest on him and his righteousness by faith, which faith is the sole instrument of justification. Those same standards insist that good works follow as fruits and evidences, and that final judgment is according to works, not on the basis of works, since the ground remains Christ alone.

Edwards entered the ministry formed by English Reformed orthodoxy and the New England experience of the Halfway Covenant of 1662. He served under Solomon Stoddard, who died in 1729, and inherited a parish practice that admitted many to the Lord Supper. The moral and ecclesial background sharpened Edwards zeal to distinguish true conversion from mere profession. In 1734 he preached a series on justification that helped ignite the Northampton revival of 1734 to 1735. In those sermons he said with clarity that faith does not justify as a work, nor as a virtue with inherent excellency, but only as the instrument of union with Christ, and that the righteousness by which we are accepted is wholly alien, the righteousness of Christ. This aligns neatly with Belgic article 22 and Westminster 11.

Where, then, do questions arise The first locus is his vivid account of faith and union. In the 1730s and 1740s, culminating in Religious Affections in 1746, Edwards described true faith as a new spiritual sense, a relish of divine beauty, a consent of the heart to God as supremely excellent. When he turns to justification, he says faith justifies as that which unites to Christ, and it unites by virtue of its consent to Christ. In preaching and in later reflections like A Treatise on Grace, composed about 1754 and published after his death in 1758, he sometimes speaks of God appointing, on account of Christ, that he will accept faith, rather than other acts, as the condition of the covenant. He adds that there is a fitness, or suitableness, that faith, rather than any other grace, should be the uniting bond. That language of fitness is not in the confessions, and it leans on his metaphysics of dispositions and his moral psychology.

Critics have heard in this a quiet shift from pure instrumentality to an account that sneaks in the quality of faith. Against that, Edwards returns again and again to the confessional denial. The moral goodness in faith, he says, is in no respect the ground of the acceptance. God justifies only for Christ sake, imputing his righteousness. Faith is not a work that earns the verdict. So far, Edwards is squarely in the Westminster lane. Yet his way of explaining why faith is the instrument, by invoking its spiritual beauty and its unique relation to Christ excellency, opens a door for later misreadings. In traditional scholastic Reformed treatments, such as in Francis Turretin in the 1670s, the instrumentality of faith is parsed in tighter forensic terms. Faith is a hand that receives. Its moral quality belongs to sanctification. Edwards agrees materially, but his idiom invites a hearing that draws faith into the ground rather than keeping it at the level of instrument.

A second locus concerns active obedience. Westminster 11 teaches that God imputes the obedience and satisfaction of Christ. That has been read as both the life long obedience and the atoning death. New England debated this in the eighteenth century. Edwards affirms the whole righteousness of Christ as imputed. He speaks of the obedience of Christ, his fulfilling of the law, as that which God reckons to believers. He does not separate the passive from the active, but takes the package of Christ righteousness as the ground of acceptance. On this point his doctrine rests on the confessional foundation.

A third locus is the relation of justification to perseverance and evangelical obedience. The confessions teach that the justified cannot fall from the state of justification, yet they need daily pardon and will be judged according to works. In the 1740s and 1750s Edwards pressed for the necessity of perseverance, preached the duty of evangelical obedience, and insisted that only those with enduring fruits should be admitted to full communion. His famous communion controversy, leading to his dismissal from Northampton in 1750, turned on evidence of conversion for church membership. Critics might read this pastoral rigor as shading toward a neonomian spirit, in which obedience becomes a condition for acceptance. Yet in his doctrinal frame the distinction holds. Works are evidences of union, not part of the ground of justification. His insistence that perseverance is necessary to salvation is of a piece with Westminster 17 on perseverance, not a revision of Westminster 11.

To understand both the clarity and the pressure points, one must remember the broader debates that formed Edwards voice. The seventeenth century had seen antinomian charges against Tobias Crisp on one side and neonomian proposals associated with Richard Baxter on the other. Scotland lived through the Marrow controversy from 1718 to 1723, pitting free grace preaching against fears of laxity. New England added its own local stresses, from Stoddardean practice to the excesses and disorders of the Great Awakening in 1741 and 1742. Edwards was determined to protect both the free verdict of God for the ungodly and the reality of the new birth and its fruits. His confessional commitments guided him, while his metaphysics and moral psychology gave him a vocabulary not found in the sixteenth century.

The reception confirms the ambiguity. Many Reformed readers, then and now, judge that Edwards stands comfortably within the confessional line on the core of the doctrine. He is forensic, he teaches imputation, he safeguards sola fide, and he treats works as fruits. Others, especially those wary of the language of fitness and the emphasis on the sensory spirituality of faith, register concern that his idiom tends to moralize the instrument. The downstream history in New Divinity circles complicates the picture. Samuel Hopkins, born in 1721, and later Nathaniel Taylor, born in 1786, moved toward moral government accounts and away from robust imputation. That drift was not inevitable from Edwards, but the path was eased by his dispositional ontology and his culture of psychological analysis.

What then is the verdict Edwards maintains substantial agreement with the Reformed confessions on justification. His most direct teaching in 1734 and beyond keeps the forensic ground and the instrumental reception. He affirms the imputation of the obedience and satisfaction of Christ. He denies any infusion as the basis of acceptance. He refuses to let works intrude upon the verdict. At the same time, his edifying idiom and metaphysical account of the soul lead him to speak of faith, and of its union creating consent, in ways that blur the tight scholastic border lines. For pastors and theologians who prize the precise boundaries of Westminster 11, it is wise to borrow his zeal for union with Christ and his careful sorting of evidence and ground, while also tightening his account of instrumentality to avoid any hint of moralized merit. The confessional plumb line holds, and Edwards largely walks beneath it, though sometimes close enough to the edge to make later builders wobble.
