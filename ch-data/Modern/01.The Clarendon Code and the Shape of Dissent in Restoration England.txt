### ESSAY
The Restoration opened with a promise of healing and settling, yet it quickly hardened into a legal regime meant to secure a single national church. The so called Clarendon Code named for Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, and passed between 1661 and 1665, sought to bind the polity of England to episcopal uniformity and to break the pastoral and civic influence of those ministers who would not conform. Behind the statutes lay the memory of civil war and republican experiment, and the fear that the pulpit could again become a trumpet for sedition. The question before Parliament and bishops was simple and stark. Could the realm be safe unless the Church of England was uniform in doctrine, worship, and government, and unless dissenting ministers were either brought within it or pushed to the margins.

The context is decisive. Charles II returned in 1660 after the collapse of the Protectorate. The Convention Parliament restored bishops and cathedrals, and the Savoy Conference of 1661 brought leading Presbyterians such as Richard Baxter and Anglicans under Gilbert Sheldon into face to face negotiation over a possible revision of the Prayer Book. The Presbyterians hoped for a national church broad enough to include them. They asked for changes to ceremonies, for a looser form of subscription, and for acceptance of ordination already received. The bishops, resolved to restore Laudian order without Lauds exact rhetoric, made only slight concessions. Meanwhile the political mood hardened after the Fifth Monarchist rising under Thomas Venner in January 1661. Fears of plot and sectarian radicalism gave the Cavalier Parliament elected in 1661 both the will and the numbers to legislate for strict uniformity.

The Clarendon Code consists of four statutes knit together by a clear design. First came the Corporation Act of December 1661, which required municipal officeholders to receive the sacrament according to the rites of the Church of England, to abjure the Solemn League and Covenant, and to take the oath of allegiance. Though aimed at civic corporations rather than clergy, it struck at the social base of Presbyterianism in towns and ensured that borough power would lie with churchmen loyal to the restored order. Then came the keystone, the Act of Uniformity of May 1662. It imposed use of the new Book of Common Prayer of 1662 in all public worship, required episcopal ordination for ministers who had not received it, demanded assent and consent to everything contained and prescribed in the Prayer Book, and required declaration against the Covenant. The deadline of Saint Bartholomew day, 24 August 1662, produced what later generations called the Great Ejection. Perhaps two thousand ministers, largely Presbyterian but also Independent and some moderate Baptists, left their livings rather than signify full compliance.

Two further statutes tightened the net around those ejected. The Conventicle Act of 1664 prohibited religious assemblies of more than five persons beyond the household for worship not according to the Prayer Book. It escalated penalties on repeated offenses, including fines and imprisonment, and it deliberately aimed to sever the pastoral link between ejected ministers and their former flocks. The Five Mile Act of 1665 sometimes called the Oxford Act forbade ejected ministers who would not swear a stringent oath of nonresistance from coming within five miles of any corporate town or of any place where they had held benefice. This statute tried to remove ministers from the social and geographic networks that had once sustained them. An additional piece of the coercive mosaic, the Quaker Act of 1662, though not always counted within the Clarendon Code, exemplified the broader climate, as it criminalized Quaker gatherings and speech.

The code bore Clarendons name because he served as Lord Chancellor and chief minister from 1660 to 1667, yet historians note that he neither drafted all its provisions nor sought the harshest measures. Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London in 1660 and archbishop of Canterbury from 1663, and the bishops around him, were the most consistent architects of enforcement. The Cavalier Parliament supplied the numbers and the temper. What mattered in practice was not authorship but function. The laws aimed to produce uniformity by law and to starve nonconforming ministers of pulpits, audiences, and influence. They required ministers to accept episcopal ordination and fixed liturgy, they broke up meetings, and they kept clergy away from towns where public opinion might favor them.

It helps to distinguish terms that contemporaries used with care. Nonconformity in the strict Restoration sense meant refusal to conform to the prescribed rites, ceremonies, governance, and subscriptions of the Church of England, while still often claiming loyalty to the national church itself. Many of the ejected in 1662 insisted that they were not separating on principle. They held the parish ideal, they cherished the reformed doctrine they heard in the Articles, and they desired comprehension, that is, an enlargement of the terms of communion so that they could remain. Dissent, by contrast, meant separation, the formation of gathered congregations outside the parochial structure, with their own discipline, covenants, and ministers. This line did not stay sharp. The code itself pushed the nonconforming toward dissent as pastors and people grew used to meeting in conventicles and then in licensed meeting houses. By the 1670s the labels Dissenter and Nonconformist were used broadly for those outside the establishment, yet the difference of posture remained important to leaders such as Baxter, who long pressed for comprehension rather than secession.

A second pair of terms framed policy debate. Comprehension meant a bid to widen the established church by easing terms of conformity. Proposals circulated in 1668 and 1669 led by John Tillotson and Edward Stillingfleet. They envisioned tolerable ceremonies, a form of doctrinal subscription limited to essentials, and acceptance of prior ordination. The aim was unity within a single national church. Toleration meant something else. It signified legal permission for dissenters to worship outside the established church, under conditions such as oaths of allegiance and registration of meeting houses, without altering the terms of conformity inside the church. The Restoration witnessed both strategies. Charles II issued a Declaration of Indulgence in 1672 that licensed many dissenting preachers and allowed worship outside parish churches. Parliament forced him to withdraw it in 1673 and passed the first Test Act that same year, which required officeholders to take the sacrament in the Church of England and to repudiate transubstantiation, thereby excluding both Catholics and most Protestant dissenters from office. After the Revolution of 1688 the Toleration Act of 1689 granted limited legal toleration to Protestant dissenters, excluding Catholics and anti trinitarians, while comprehension once more failed in the 1689 to 1690 schemes that stalled in Convocation and Parliament.

The enforcement of the Clarendon Code varied widely by region and year. In the mid 1660s enforcement was often sharp, especially under the Conventicle and Five Mile Acts. Magisterial zeal increased again in the Tory reaction of 1681 to 1685, when local justices used the laws to suppress Whig aligned dissenters. In other moments, especially under the 1672 indulgence and as informal arrangements grew, authorities winked at conventicles or moderated fines. Many ministers navigated a gray zone, preaching in private houses, publishing devotional works, and seeking patronage from sympathetic gentry. The code nevertheless achieved its core aim. It expelled an entire generation of reformed ministers from the parochial system and replaced them with clergy loyal to episcopal governance and the Prayer Book. It turned the English parish into the exclusive stage for Anglican liturgy and pushed alternative Protestant ministries into a tolerated or persecuted shadow sphere.

Theologically and intellectually, the code was grounded in a view of the church as a public good policed by the magistrate. Uniformity served truth and peace. The countercase, articulated by Baxter, Owen, and later by John Locke in the Letter concerning Toleration of 1689, argued that coerced uniformity could not produce sincere conscience, that liberty in things indifferent should prevail, and that the magistrate had no charter from Christ to command belief. The failure of comprehension after 1662 was not only political but also sacramental and ecclesiological. For the bishops, episcopal ordination and common prayer were of the esse of the church in England. For Presbyterians, they were matters indifferent that could be set aside to preserve unity. The code locked in the Anglican answer.

The long reception of the Clarendon Code moved from persecution to partial accommodation. The Great Ejection of 1662 created a learned Nonconformist tradition with seminaries, confessions, and a literature of consolation and pastoral care. The Toleration Act of 1689 recognized dissenters as lawful worshipers but did not admit them to universities or public office as long as the Test Acts remained. The word Nonconformist became a badge as well as a barrier. In the eighteenth century this status fostered denominational consolidation among Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists, while Quakers pursued their own trajectory. The code's ambition of uniformity failed in the long run, but it succeeded in anchoring Anglican identity in a legal and liturgical settlement that proved durable.

In sum, the Clarendon Code named a suite of Restoration statutes designed to impose uniformity and to cripple the ministry of those who resisted, by expulsion, by disruption of meetings, and by banishment from civic centers. Nonconformity meant refusal to meet the terms of the establishment, often with a wish for comprehension. Dissent meant separation and the building of alternative churches. Comprehension sought to broaden the establishment, while toleration allowed life outside it. The Restoration chose uniformity first, then grudging toleration, and left comprehension as an unrealized hope.
