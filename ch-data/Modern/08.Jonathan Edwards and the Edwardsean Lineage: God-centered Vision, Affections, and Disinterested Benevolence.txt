### ESSAY
The problem that animated Jonathan Edwards was simple to state and vast in scope. How does the triune God relate to creation in such a way that revival, moral transformation, and the beauty of holiness make sense together. His answer was a daring synthesis of Reformed dogmatics, a high doctrine of God, and a sophisticated account of the mind and the will, forged in the heat of awakening and the chill of Enlightenment doubt.

The setting is New England, 1703 to 1758 for Edwards himself, with decisive moments in 1734 to 1735 during the Northampton awakening, and 1740 to 1742 during the transatlantic Great Awakening. Edwards read John Locke, savored Newton, and knew the piety of the Reformed scholastics. He preached, watched people weep and tremble, and tried to discern God from the noise. His A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God in 1737 offered a careful case study of revival, but it was not mere reportage. It was an argument that divine grace can be described and tested.

Three interlocked distinctives stand out. First, a God-centered teleology. In The End for Which God Created the World, published posthumously in 1765, Edwards argued that God created to communicate and display his glory, a glory understood as the effulgence of divine beauty and love. Creation is not a rival to God but the stage of his self-diffusion. Hence his account of true virtue in the companion Dissertation on the Nature of True Virtue defines holiness as a consent to Being in general, that is, a disinterested benevolence that loves God supremely and then loves neighbors in the proportion that they share in God.

Second, an affective psychology of religion. In Religious Affections of 1746, Edwards distinguished between signs of grace and marks of mere enthusiasm. The Spirit renovates the heart by giving new dispositions, so that the affections, not bare notions, are the seat of true piety. He crafted a taxonomy of twelve signs, concluding that the infallible marks are those new tastes and practices that conform the soul to Christ and his beauty. His pastoral goal was to steer between dead formalism and reckless enthusiasm.

Third, a compatibilist account of the will. Freedom of the Will in 1754 defends moral necessity without fatalism. The will chooses according to the strongest motive as seen by the heart, and that strongest motive is governed by the moral disposition of the person. Natural ability remains intact, yet moral inability binds the sinner to sin until grace changes the disposition. In Original Sin of 1758, Edwards explained the solidarity of humanity in Adam, joining federal headship to a real, natural union that transmits depravity without crude materialism. These arguments allowed him to preserve responsibility and the need for regeneration.

Around these pillars, Edwards built a metaphysics that many have called idealist. He spoke of continuous creation, the creaturely world existing moment by moment by divine volition, and he treated the qualities of the world as ideas in the mind. This did not erase nature but suffused it with typological meaning. In his Notes on the Apocalypse and The History of the Work of Redemption, manuscript projects of the 1740s, he traced types and histories in which God patterned creation to lead minds to Christ.

The turning points in Edwards's life reveal how his theology worked in practice. He intervened in the revival excesses of 1742 with The Distinguishing Marks and later with Religious Affections, arguing for discernment, bodily effects not being necessary or sufficient for grace. He opposed the Halfway Covenant by demanding credible conversion for communion, which led to his dismissal from Northampton in 1750. He served the Stockbridge mission among the Mohican and Mohawk from 1751 to 1757, where his high theology met the practical cross-cultural work of preaching and translation. In early 1758 he accepted the presidency of the College of New Jersey at Princeton, only to die that March.

Edwards's followers gathered and reshaped his lines of thought into what came to be called the New Divinity or Edwardseanism. Joseph Bellamy, born 1719 and died 1790, trained by Edwards, systematized the revival ethic. He insisted on the duty of immediate repentance, employed the use of means, and preached a God-centered morality that applied Edwards's true virtue to parish life. Samuel Hopkins, 1721 to 1803, radicalized the moral thrust with his doctrine of disinterested benevolence. One must be willing to be damned for the glory of God, he said to shock hearers out of self-love. Hopkins also wrote against slavery in 1776, linking benevolence to social reform.

Jonathan Edwards Jr, 1745 to 1801, and Nathanael Emmons, 1745 to 1840, sharpened the volitional themes. Emmons forged the exercise scheme, arguing that all moral character consists solely in the exercises of the will, not in a corrupt substance. This allowed New Divinity preachers to press responsibility and to deny that native depravity absolves duty. Many in this stream moved away from a strict commercial satisfaction view of atonement toward a public justice or governmental account, influenced by Grotius, where Christ's death exhibits and upholds the moral government of God and opens a way for the Spirit to regenerate without violating righteousness.

Institutional transmission mattered. Timothy Dwight, 1752 to 1817, as president of Yale from 1795, created a revivalist and Edwardsean climate. In 1802 a powerful awakening swept Yale. Dwight retained Edwards's teleology and affections while moderating some severe edges in pastoral practice. Nathaniel Taylor, 1786 to 1858, developed the New Haven Theology, preserving duty and moral government while reinterpreting original sin as certainty, not necessity. Taylor insisted that sinners are able to repent under gospel light, a claim that set off controversy with Princeton theologians like Charles Hodge in the 1820s and 1830s.

By the 1830s, Edwardsean ideas stood at the center of the Old School and New School Presbyterian division of 1837. New School allies of the New England Theology prized revival methods, moral government, and immediate repentance. Old School leaders argued that the Edwardsean exercise scheme and revisions to imputation compromised confessional orthodoxy. Meanwhile, Charles Grandison Finney, 1792 to 1875, adopted and altered New School ideas, adding new measures like the anxious seat and perfectionist claims that many Edwardseans rejected, even as they shared a language of moral suasion and government.

The significance of this development is twofold. First, Edwards provided a metaphysical and psychological grammar that enabled evangelicals to make sense of revival, responsibility, and divine sovereignty within a coherent God-centered vision. His insistence that beauty and holiness are one, that true religion lives in transformed affections, and that freedom is consistent with moral necessity, gave later preachers durable tools. Second, his heirs showed both the generative power and the fragility of synthesis. Push true virtue toward disinterested benevolence, and a demanding ethics emerges that can energize abolitionism and missions. Press moral agency hard, and one risks softening doctrines of imputation and atonement.

Historians have debated whether Edwards is best read as the last of the Reformed scholastics or the first of American philosophers. In fact he is both, a bridge figure whose sermons stand next to metaphysical dissertations. Modern scholarship since the mid twentieth century has emphasized his fidelity to Augustinian and Reformed themes, while also tracing his creative recasting of Lockean psychology and idealist hints.

The legacy persisted in missions and reform. The Edwardsean concert of prayer, first set forth in 1747, nurtured a transatlantic habit that helped make possible the missionary movement of the early 1800s. Hopkinsians were early voices against slavery. Dwight trained pastors who seeded revivals in the Connecticut Valley and the West. Even critics of the New England Theology were schooled in Edwards's categories.

Jonathan Edwards made beauty the key to doctrine and the Spirit's renovation the key to life, and his followers tried, with both brilliance and overreach, to make that beauty rule a nation.
