### ESSAY
Neo-Evangelicalism names a mid twentieth century reform movement within conservative Protestantism that sought to retain historic orthodoxy while rejecting the separatist posture that had defined American fundamentalism after the 1920s. Its leaders argued that conservative Protestants could be rigorously orthodox, culturally conversant, academically credible, and socially responsible at the same time. This was both a theological claim and a strategy for reentering the public square after decades of retreat.

The context was the aftermath of the fundamentalist modernist controversies of the 1910s and 1920s. Following the Scopes Trial of 1925 and a series of bruising denominational conflicts, many conservatives withdrew from mainline institutions, built independent churches and Bible institutes, and adopted a strong separatist ethos. Figures like Carl McIntire argued for rigid secondary separation from any who cooperated with liberal Protestants. By the late 1930s and early 1940s, however, a younger cohort surveyed a changed landscape. The National Association of Evangelicals was founded in 1942 to provide cooperation without capitulation to liberalism, and World War II, the rise of mass media, and the democratization of higher education opened new avenues for outreach.

Harold John Ockenga, pastor in Boston and a key strategist, gave the reform its name. In 1947 he spoke of a new evangelicalism, defined by doctrinal fidelity combined with a repudiation of separatism, a commitment to social responsibility, and a welcome to the best tools of scholarship. That same year he helped launch Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, an evangelical graduate school intentionally positioned for academic excellence. Fuller gathered faculty like E. J. Carnell, Wilbur Smith, and later George Eldon Ladd, and it aimed to form pastors and scholars who could contribute at the highest levels without abandoning core evangelical convictions.

Carl F. H. Henry provided the movement its first lucid manifesto. The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism appeared in 1947, arguing that the gospel demanded more than individual conversion and personal morality. Henry called evangelicals to address systemic evils in economics, race relations, and international affairs, and to retrieve a public theology grounded in the authority of Scripture and the lordship of Christ over all of life. He would later edit Christianity Today, founded in 1956 with support from Billy Graham and L. Nelson Bell, shaping it into the chief platform for evangelical reflection on theology, culture, and politics.

If Ockenga was the architect and Henry the theorist, Billy Graham became the movement's public face. His Los Angeles crusade in 1949 vaulted him to national prominence through savvy use of newspapers and radio. In 1957 he accepted sponsorship from the Protestant Council of New York City for his Madison Square Garden campaign, signaling a strategy of cooperative evangelism across denominational lines. Fundamentalist leaders like Bob Jones Sr. and Carl McIntire denounced the cooperation, but Graham's crusades drew millions and normalized an evangelical posture of broad coalition while insisting on the necessity of new birth.

On the academic front, E. J. Carnell's Christian Commitment in 1957 and The Case for Orthodox Theology in 1959 sought to demonstrate that evangelical belief could satisfy rigorous philosophical criteria for rationality without surrendering the primacy of revelation. Bernard Ramm's The Christian View of Science and Scripture in 1954 rejected flood geology and proposed a more nuanced approach to origins, insisting that evangelicals could affirm biblical authority while engaging contemporary science. George Eldon Ladd's The Gospel of the Kingdom in 1959 advanced an inaugurated eschatology, already not yet, that would reshape evangelical readings of the Gospels and Revelation by framing the kingdom as both present and future. Across the Atlantic, F. F. Bruce, with The New Testament Documents Are They Reliable in 1943 and a stream of critical commentaries, modeled evangelical scholarship in dialogue with the academy. John Stott, whose Basic Christianity in 1958 distilled the claims of the gospel, became a principal leader in Anglican evangelicalism and a bridge to global networks.

Institutions multiplied. InterVarsity Christian Fellowship organized campus work in the 1940s and launched the Urbana missions conference in 1946, aligning student activism with world evangelization. The Evangelical Theological Society formed in 1949, signaling the movement's scholarly ambitions, with inerrancy of Scripture as its doctrinal basis. Christianity Today, beginning in 1956, offered a steady national voice. Seminaries like Fuller and later Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, founded 1963, trained cohorts who would occupy pulpits, classrooms, and mission fields. The movement embraced media as a vocation, from radio preaching to paperback theology, adding reach to its reforming aim.

By the late 1960s and 1970s, internal tensions sharpened. Harold Lindsell's The Battle for the Bible in 1976 criticized institutions and denominations that he believed were retreating from biblical inerrancy, with Fuller's shift toward a language of infallibility in the early 1970s often cited as emblematic. In response to mounting confusion, the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy formed in 1977 and produced the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy in 1978, articulating a carefully crafted definition of inspiration and truthfulness. Meanwhile, Henry's early call for social action matured into the Chicago Declaration of Evangelical Social Concern in 1973, where leaders confessed past neglect of racial and economic justice and pledged renewed engagement. John Stott helped shape the Lausanne Covenant of 1974, a global evangelical charter that insisted both evangelism and social responsibility belong to Christian mission.

Francis Schaeffer added a cultural apologetic that resonated with students and artists. From L Abri, founded in Switzerland in 1955, he taught that Christianity answers the modern crisis of meaning. Works like The God Who Is There and Escape from Reason in 1968, and later A Christian Manifesto in 1981, urged evangelicals to engage philosophy, art, and law. Schaeffer's influence contributed to the political mobilization of some evangelicals in the late 1970s and early 1980s, though that activism was not identical with the earlier neo-evangelical vision.

Theologically and intellectually, neo-evangelicalism sought synthesis. It held classic evangelical commitments to the authority of Scripture, the substitutionary death and bodily resurrection of Christ, and the necessity of conversion. It criticized fundamentalist obscurantism, embraced common grace, and adopted scholarly tools in biblical studies, history, and philosophy without conceding the uniqueness of revelation. It aimed to wed evangelism with social ethics, replacing a truncated gospel of private piety with a kingdom horizon that touched public life. Its institutional imagination proved decisive, as schools, societies, magazines, and para church ministries built a durable ecosystem.

Reception was mixed. Fundamentalists accused neo-evangelicals of compromise and drift. Some mainline observers suspected a new packaging of old dogma. Yet the movement won remarkable ground in the postwar decades. It produced a growing body of scholarship, trained pastors and missionaries for expanding suburbs and cities, and played a leading role in global evangelical cooperation. Internal debates over inerrancy and political alignment showed the limits of the synthesis, and by the 1980s one could speak of multiple evangelicalisms. Still, the core wager of neo-evangelicalism that historic orthodoxy could be articulated in public, in the university, and in service to the common good, remade the conservative Protestant landscape.

In sum, neo-evangelicalism was a reform impulse with doctrines as old as Protestant orthodoxy and strategies tailored to a modern age, and its legacy endures wherever evangelicals pursue truth, mission, and neighbor love together.
