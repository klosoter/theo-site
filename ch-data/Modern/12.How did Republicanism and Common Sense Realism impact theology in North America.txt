### ESSAY
The theology of North America after the mid eighteenth century learned a new grammar. Republican political ideals promised a people of virtue under self-government, and Scottish Common Sense philosophy taught that ordinary minds could know reality, morals, and testimony with assurance. Together they furnished clergy with a civic framework and an epistemic toolkit. Out of that union came a voluntarist, evidential, and activist Protestant mainstream, and a Catholic strategy for life under a republic, all before the twentieth century storms.

The context is familiar. Disestablishment moved from principle to law when Virginia adopted the Statute for Religious Freedom in 1786, and the First Amendment guarantees followed in 1791. In New England the standing order held on until Massachusetts disestablished in 1833. The vacuum created by the loss of tax support energized a culture of voluntary societies, print, and itinerancy. Meanwhile, a Scottish import arrived with John Witherspoon, minister and philosopher, who took the helm at the College of New Jersey in 1768. Witherspoon drew on Thomas Reid, born 1710, and the later Dugald Stewart, born 1753, to preach that the mind possesses trustworthy common notions, that sensory data and moral intuitions are reliable, and that human testimony, rightly sifted, yields knowledge. This was a ready-made arsenal against skepticism. It also suited a republic that needed citizens trained in reasoned assent and public virtue.

From the 1790s, the Second Great Awakening carried a republican affect into the meetinghouse and the camp. Cane Ridge in 1801 made vivid the claims of a democratized piety. Ministers and lay leaders transposed civic participation into religious choice. Conversion became a decision, a public act under the eye of neighbors, and a pledge to moral reform in a free society. Baptists and Methodists thrived because their polities and preaching fit this ethos. Congregationalists and Presbyterians negotiated representative governance that echoed constitutional structures, sessions and synods mirroring local and federal tiers. Meanwhile, a rising class of female reformers enacted republican motherhood as benevolence. Bible and tract societies channeled domestic virtue toward national character, the American Bible Society founded in 1816 being emblematic.

Common Sense Realism gave a philosophical floor to this activism. At Princeton Theological Seminary, founded in 1812, Archibald Alexander, 1772-1851, fashioned a curriculum that married piety to Reid and Bacon. Evidences courses used William Paley's Evidences of Christianity from 1794 and then Alexander's own work on the canon in 1836. The method sounded scientific to a republic smitten with improvement. Charles Hodge, 1797-1878, extended it in the Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review from 1825 and in his Systematic Theology from 1872-1873. Facts first, induction second, system last. Scripture was read historically and grammatically, with confidence that sense perception and public testimony are generally reliable. Natural theology, via design arguments, belonged alongside exegesis, since the same common sense that knows ordinary objects knows final causes. James McCosh, 1811-1894, later president at Princeton, defended the intuitions of the mind in 1860 and wrestled with Darwin after 1859, but kept the common sense frame.

The republican vision and this realist method also reframed anthropology and soteriology. From Jonathan Edwards's heirs came the New Divinity, yet it crossed paths with a moral government theology at New Haven. Timothy Dwight, 1752-1817, and Nathaniel W Taylor, 1786-1858, introduced a language of obligation and ability that made moral agency central. Taylor's claim that sin is a voluntary choice supported an appeal addressed to citizens capable of decision. Charles Grandison Finney, 1792-1875, a lawyer turned evangelist, systematized new measures in the 1820s and 1830s, arguing in his Lectures on Revivals from 1835 that revivals could be promoted by right means. Here republican voluntarism and common sense converged. If truth is perspicuous and duty clear, then exhortation can prudently secure reform. Lyman Beecher, 1775-1863, organized voluntary societies and preached national moral order, making republican virtue a homiletical drumbeat.

Not all Protestants moved in one line. Unitarians, led by William Ellery Channing, 1780-1842, trusted the moral sense and stressed benevolence, taking from common sense realism both its confidence in reason and its suspicion of speculative metaphysics. Horace Bushnell, 1802-1876, later challenged the reigning assumptions about language and method, contending in the 1840s that truth in religion is more analogical and personal than the evidentialists allowed. Yet even critics argued on the public ground cleared by common sense and within the civic expectations of a republic. The Old School and New School Presbyterian split in 1837 exposed the tensions. Princeton divines used common sense to defend confessional orthodoxy, especially imputation and original sin, while New School allies used similar appeals to moral intuition to revise those doctrines. The reunion of 1869 reflects a partial settlement but not a full resolution.

Roman Catholics navigated the new order with their own adjustments. John Carroll, 1735-1815, the first bishop of Baltimore, adopted a posture of patriotic loyalty and cautious accommodation. Lay trusteeism in the 1790s and 1810s experimented with republican forms in parish governance, and the ensuing conflicts helped define limits. The Provincial Council of Baltimore in 1829 and later the Plenary Councils of Baltimore in 1852, 1866, and 1884 set norms for discipline and education, forging a Catholic way under disestablishment. The separation of church and state, once feared, made room for Catholic flourishing, although Rome's 1899 critique of Americanism later warned against baptizing every republican ideal.

Slavery and Civil War forced republican theology into crisis. Abolitionists invoked self evident rights and the moral law, reading Exodus and the Declaration together. David Walker's Appeal in 1829 and the preaching of ministers across the North asked common sense whether chattel slavery could ever be natural. Defenders in the South appealed to Scripture and providence as they read them. Charles Hodge held a moderate antislavery position yet resisted immediate abolitionist strategies, positioning himself as an exegete rather than a revolutionary. The war of 1861-1865 chastened every civil theology of providence, but did not erase the habit of reading nation and redemption in tandem.

The intellectual significance is layered. First, epistemology. Scottish realism gave Protestant divines confidence that revelation, history, and nature can be known by ordinary minds. Historical grammatical exegesis and harmonizing apologetics rose with that confidence. Second, anthropology. Republicanism elevated the language of virtue, consent, and agency. Theology accordingly emphasized the conscience, the will, and social reform. Third, ecclesiology and mission. Voluntarism created a culture of societies and boards, from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions founded in 1810 to tract and temperance societies. Churches learned to function as associations of citizens who freely bind themselves for public ends. Fourth, hermeneutics and doctrine. At Princeton, inerrancy as a concept matured on common sense ground, while at New Haven and Oberlin, moral government and perfectionism drew on the same soil to different ends.

Reception and legacy carry into the twentieth century. The Princeton style of evidentialism and confidence in sense and testimony underwrote fundamentalist appeals in the 1910s and 1920s, even as German idealism, higher criticism, and pragmatism eroded older certainties. Revivalist decisionism passed into evangelical norms of conversion and altar call. Catholic bishops continued to balance republican loyalties with Roman directives, with 1884 Baltimore producing the Baltimore Catechism that shaped immigrant generations. Across the color line, African American churches founded in the early republic, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1816, used the language of rights and divine justice to claim place and dignity, a republican theology of liberation anchored in Scripture.

By the close of the nineteenth century, both republicanism and common sense realism had imprinted North American theology with a public character, an activist bent, and a confidence that truth can be spoken in common, even as new currents were already testing the strength of that conviction.
