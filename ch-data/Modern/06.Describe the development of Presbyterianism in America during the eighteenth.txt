### ESSAY
Begin with a single figure standing on a dock. In 1706 Francis Makemie, born in 1658 and raised in Ulster, gathered ministers in the mid Atlantic and helped constitute the Presbytery of Philadelphia. He had already planted congregations on the Eastern Shore and in New York and Virginia, and in 1707 he defended his right to preach before Governor Cornbury in New York, winning acquittal and appealing to the English Toleration Act of 1689. From that moment, the question sharpened. Could a transatlantic Reformed people, scattered by migration and formed by British confessional standards, knit a coherent church on American soil.

The context favored such an attempt. After 1717 waves of Scots Irish immigrants crossed the Atlantic, pressing down the Great Wagon Road into Pennsylvania, the Shenandoah, and the Carolina backcountry. They brought a memory of presbyterial order and a taste for catechetical rigor. Scots and Irish ministers arrived with training from Glasgow and Edinburgh, while New England graduates with Congregational pedigrees found kindred company in the mid Atlantic. Colonial law extended limited toleration, yet local magistrates varied in sympathy. On the ground, the needs were blunt. There were more people than pulpits, more pulpits than ministers, and more miles than roads. Presbyterian polity, with local sessions, regional presbyteries, and broader synods, promised orderly elasticity well suited to these conditions.

From the 1706 presbytery the body expanded. In 1716 ministers formed the first Synod, creating several presbyteries, among them Philadelphia, New Castle, Snow Hill, and Long Island. This institutional step required clarity about the church's doctrinal center. The inherited standard was the Westminster Confession of Faith with Larger and Shorter Catechisms, drafted in the 1640s. Yet the American field was mixed. Some ministers came by way of New England, suspicious of rigid subscription. Others, like John Thomson born 1690 and active in the 1720s, pressed for unqualified adherence, warning that doctrinal drift would unmake the church. The compromise, known as the Adopting Act of 1729, required ministers to receive the Westminster standards, to declare any scruples, and subjected those scruples to the judgment of presbytery. The language of essentials and necessary articles allowed unity without uniformity, a pattern that would echo to the century's end.

Meanwhile a new energy convulsed Protestant churches. The revivals of the 1730s and 1740s, later called the Great Awakening, crossed colonial boundaries and stirred Presbyterian pulpits. William Tennent, born 1673, ran a rustic school along the Neshaminy Creek that critics dubbed the Log College around 1726. It trained earnest candidates who prized experimental piety and direct preaching. His son, Gilbert Tennent born 1703, became the most feared revivalist in the denomination. His sermon The Danger of an Unconverted Ministry, preached in 1740 and printed widely, charged that some clergy lacked the new birth and so starved their flocks. The rhetoric cleaved the church. Older ministers cautioned against lay exhorters, itinerancy that ignored presbytery lines, and the ordination of men they judged underprepared. In 1741 the Synod fractured. The Old Side expelled the pro revival Presbytery of New Brunswick, and the New Side soon formed the Synod of New York in 1745.

That schism was not mere temperament. It exposed questions of knowledge and grace, order and life. Jonathan Dickinson, born 1688 and a New Sider by sympathy, sought stable ground. He defended revival preaching, insisted on learned ministry, and worked behind the scenes to check extremism. The New Side founded the College of New Jersey in 1746 to educate ministers who combined piety and scholarship. Dickinson served briefly as its first president until 1747, followed by Aaron Burr, then the theologian Jonathan Edwards in 1758, then Samuel Finley. In the South, Samuel Davies born 1723 carried revival energies into Virginia, securing legal recognition for dissenting meetinghouses, preaching to enslaved Africans, teaching them hymns and catechisms, and forming the Hanover Presbytery in 1755. His sermons modeled eloquence yoked to doctrine and pastoral care.

The French and Indian War from 1754 to 1763 disrupted frontier settlements and tested church networks. Presbyteries sent supplies, chaplains, and counsel. The shared strain softened partisan lines. By 1758 the two Synods negotiated reunion. The terms accepted the reality of revival, condemned disorderly practices, and set common standards for candidacy and ordination. The united body, styled the Synod of New York and Philadelphia, balanced oversight and evangelistic zeal. It honored the Adopting Act and affirmed presbyterial gatekeeping over examinations, Latin and Greek competence, and trials for licensure.

Reunion had two deeper effects. First, it rehabilitated the idea that Presbyterianism could be a home for evangelical affections without sacrificing confessional backbone. Second, it accelerated institution building. The College of New Jersey grew into a national school of ministry and letters. In 1768 John Witherspoon, born 1723, a Scottish minister and moral philosopher, accepted the presidency. He imported a pedagogy shaped by Scottish common sense philosophy, trained a generation of ministers and statesmen, and gave the church an intellectual center that was both Reformed and modern.

Then came politics. Witherspoon signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, preached on public virtue, and taught that a free republic required educated citizens and principled clergy. Many Scots Irish Presbyterians in the backcountry supported the patriot cause, though there were Loyalist pockets and wary neutrals. War scattered congregations, thinned finances, and postponed assemblies, yet it also distanced the church from established European models. When peace returned, the Synod moved to regularize a national structure fit for a republic.

Between 1787 and 1788 the Synod drafted a Form of Government, a Book of Discipline, and a Directory for Worship, drawing from Westminster sources and American usage. Crucially, the American church revised civil magistrate passages in the Confession, denying to rulers any power to call synods or exercise church censures. That revision matched the new constitutional order and expressed a principled account of spiritual jurisdiction. The standards retained Calvinist soteriology and covenant theology, but they asserted liberty of conscience and the independence of church courts.

In May 1789 the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America held its first General Assembly in Philadelphia. John Witherspoon served as the first moderator. The church was now ordered in graded courts, sessions over congregations, presbyteries over ministers and churches, synods over groups of presbyteries, and a General Assembly for the whole body. The reunion of 1758 and the constitution of 1788 made that climactic step possible. A denomination that began with a handful of ministers in 1706 now stretched from New England through the mid Atlantic into the South and westward along the mountain valleys.

The theological significance of this arc lies in its dual fidelity. Confessional standards provided a grammar for preaching, sacraments, catechesis, and discipline. The Adopting Act taught ministers to prize essentials and to voice scruples in a court that could judge them. Revival taught pastors to expect conversions, to examine professions, and to catechize the young and the enslaved. Education anchored the whole, first in the rustic Log College, then in Princeton classrooms where Witherspoon synthesized Reformed orthodoxy with moral philosophy and republican virtue. The church learned to live with tensions, between learned order and lively fervor, and to use presbytery and synod as arenas of discernment rather than instruments of suppression.

Reception and legacy were immediate. Other communions watched the 1789 Assembly as a model of post revolutionary church building. The church's Americanized Confession circulated as a proof that inherited standards could be adapted without being emptied. Ministers trained in the College of New Jersey carried the blend of catechism and common sense into new settlements and into the expanding mission fields of the early republic. The pattern of reunion, constitutional revision, and national assembly would guide nineteenth century controversies as well, for good and ill.

So the answer to the opening question is clear. From Makemie's presbytery in 1706 to Witherspoon's gavel in 1789, American Presbyterianism learned to marry confessional backbone to evangelical heart in institutions fit for a new nation.
