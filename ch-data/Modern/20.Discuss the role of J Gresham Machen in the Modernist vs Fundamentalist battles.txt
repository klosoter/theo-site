### ESSAY
The story of J. Gresham Machen unfolds along the line where modern Western culture pressed hardest against Protestant orthodoxy. In the first decades of the twentieth century, American churches wrestled with historical criticism, evolutionary science, higher education, and the Social Gospel. The question was stark. Could historic Christianity, with its confession of the supernatural acts of God in Christ, survive as more than a respectable moral ideal in the modern West. Machen answered with a resolute yes, and he wagered not only polemical essays but also institutions on that answer.

The background begins with Old Princeton, a tradition defined by Archibald Alexander, Charles Hodge, and Benjamin B. Warfield. Old Princeton combined rigorous Reformed confessionalism with careful scholarship, defending the trustworthiness of Scripture and the reality of miracle. Warfield, who taught from 1887 until his death in 1921, articulated a doctrine of inspiration and supernaturalism that set the terms for conservative Protestant scholarship. By 1905, when the young Philadelphian Machen studied in Marburg and Goettingen, the challenge from German historicism and liberal theology was unavoidable. Under Wilhelm Herrmann he felt the attraction of a religion of experience, but he judged that such a turn abandoned the gospel as news about divine acts.

Machen joined Princeton's faculty in 1906 and soon took his place as a New Testament scholar who was fluent in the language of modern criticism yet unpersuaded by its naturalistic assumptions. In The Origin of Paul's Religion, 1921, he refuted the theory that Paul's gospel derived from pagan mystery cults or from later Hellenistic syncretism, arguing instead that it sprang from the historical Jesus and the resurrection. In What Is Faith, 1925, he contended that saving faith rests on knowledge of facts revealed by God, not on a mere will to believe. Most consequential was Christianity and Liberalism, 1923, a bracing tract that declared liberal Protestantism to be another religion altogether, a program of ethical uplift grounded in human experience rather than the redemptive acts of God.

Those books must be seen against a roiling denominational stage. The Presbyterian General Assembly in 1910 adopted the so called Five Point Deliverance, requiring ministerial candidates to affirm biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, the substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the reality of miracles. After World War I the cultural tide turned against such doctrinal tests. Harry Emerson Fosdick's sermon Shall the Fundamentalists Win, preached in New York in 1922, captured the liberal claim that the church must make room for modern knowledge and diverse theologies. The Auburn Affirmation of 1924, signed by hundreds of Presbyterian ministers, argued that the five points were not the only legitimate interpretations within the church and that the General Assembly could not bind consciences beyond the historic confessions. The force of that affirmation weakened disciplinary resolve inside the denomination.

Princeton Theological Seminary stood at the center of the Presbyterian system. Warfield's death in 1921 removed a guardian. President J. Ross Stevenson, together with Charles Erdman and other moderates, pushed for a reorganization that would align Princeton with the broader denomination. Conservatives feared that governance changes would dilute Princeton's confessional identity and admit modernist control. After years of wrangling, the 1929 General Assembly approved a reorganization that merged boards and altered oversight. For Machen, the issue was not an academic nuance but the very survival of a method of theology that presupposed the truthfulness of Scripture and the binding authority of the Westminster Standards.

The result was decisive. Rather than fight on inside a captured institution, Machen and allies resigned and founded Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia in 1929. He envisioned Westminster as the faithful heir of Old Princeton. Robert Dick Wilson brought towering competence in Semitic languages. Oswald T. Allis reinforced Old Testament scholarship. Cornelius Van Til introduced a sharpened Reformed apologetic, one that pressed the antithesis between the self-authenticating Word of God and autonomous human reason. John Murray joined in 1930, contributing rigorous systematics and ethics. The new seminary began in temporary quarters but quickly established itself as an intellectual home for ministers who wanted a confessional, academically serious alternative to the drifting mainstream.

Institution building did not end the conflict. The mission field became the next theater. In 1932, the Laymen's Foreign Missions Inquiry, culminating in the book Rethinking Missions, recommended a broader, culturally sensitive approach that conservatives read as indifferent to evangelism and to the uniqueness of Christ. The public voice of Pearl S. Buck, a prominent Presbyterian missionary and novelist, amplified these concerns as she minimized the need for conversion and questioned orthodox doctrines. Machen concluded that the denomination's Board of Foreign Missions could no longer be trusted to uphold the gospel. In 1933 he organized the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions to channel funds to confessional missionaries without compromise.

The Presbyterian courts responded. They charged Machen and others with violating church order by setting up a rival agency. Trials followed in 1934 and 1935. The issues combined questions of doctrine, conscience, and polity. Could a minister refuse financial support to an official board if he judged it unfaithful. Was there space in a national church for competing structures. In 1935 Machen was suspended from the ministry of the PCUSA for contumacy, that is, for refusing to obey the directives of the General Assembly concerning the Independent Board. For him it was another Princeton moment, a test of whether confessional integrity would yield to bureaucratic expediency. For denominational leaders it was a test of whether order could be preserved.

The next year brought separation. In 1936 Machen and like-minded ministers organized the Presbyterian Church of America, later renamed the Orthodox Presbyterian Church after legal pressure. The new communion aimed to combine strict confessionalism with evangelism and missions conducted under clear doctrinal oversight. The break did not end debate. By 1937, disagreements over eschatology and cultural questions produced a split that led Carl McIntire and others to form the Bible Presbyterian Church. Machen did not live to navigate those complexities. He died in early 1937 in North Dakota while traveling to support missionary work, closing a career spent at the hinge of doctrine and institution.

What then is the theological and intellectual significance of Machen's role. He drew a straight line between the facts of the gospel and the life of the church, insisting that Christianity is news before it is a program. He defended the authority of Scripture with scholarly tools rather than slogans. He was critical of the spirit of the age in more than one direction. He opposed Prohibition on grounds of liberty, warning that moral reform by law could deform the church's witness. He rejected the anti-intellectualism that sometimes marked the fundamentalist camp, even as he stood shoulder to shoulder with fundamentalists on the supernatural content of the faith. At Westminster he preserved the Old Princeton ideal of learned piety while permitting a fresh Reformed philosophy of knowledge through Van Til's apologetics. In short, he sustained a confessional countertradition amid the forces of modernization.

Reception has never been simple. Some historians read Machen as a principal in the fundamentalist movement, sharpened by the Scopes Trial in 1925 and the broader culture wars of the 1920s. Others emphasize his distinctively Presbyterian and confessional identity, which kept him at a cool distance from populist fundamentalism. In the field of American evangelicalism, his institutional strategy provided a template for later ventures, from seminaries to mission boards, that sought to combine academic seriousness with doctrinal clarity. Within Reformed circles, Westminster became a seedbed for ministers and scholars who shaped Presbyterian and broader evangelical thought through the later twentieth century.

Machen's trajectory illuminates the fault line that cut across modern American Protestantism and shows how a theologian can fight with books, with courts, and with schools, all in service of a church defined by the gospel as divine act and truth.
