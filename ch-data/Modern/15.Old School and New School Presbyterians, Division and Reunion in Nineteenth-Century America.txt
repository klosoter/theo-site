### ESSAY
The Old School and New School controversy appears at first like a family quarrel. Both parties confessed the Westminster Standards, preached conversion, and built churches across a restless republic. Yet in 1837 their common house split. The question is why that break was deemed necessary and how, a generation later, leading voices decided to stitch the house back together.

The immediate context was the Second Great Awakening, roughly 1790s to 1830s, which energized evangelism, spawned voluntary societies, and loosened inherited habits of order. In 1801 the Plan of Union united Presbyterian and Congregational efforts in the expanding frontier. Pastors were exchanged, presbyteries absorbed mixed congregations, and mission funds flowed through interdenominational agencies like the American Home Missionary Society and the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. The partnership carried clear benefits in thinly settled regions, but it also diluted Presbyterian polity and diffused accountability for doctrine. At the same time, revivalist technique shifted. Charles Finney, whose Lectures on Revivals of Religion appeared in 1835, championed new measures such as protracted meetings and the anxious bench, arguing that revival was the right use of means under moral law rather than a sovereign outpouring. New Haven theology under Nathaniel Taylor at Yale, formed in the 1820s, reworked Edwardsean themes with an accent on moral government, human ability, and atonement as governmental satisfaction rather than strict penal substitution.

Against these currents stood Princeton Seminary, founded in 1812, where Archibald Alexander and Samuel Miller formed ministers with a high view of confessional integrity and Presbyterian order. Charles Hodge, who began editing the Biblical Repertory in 1825 and later the Princeton Review, criticized New Haven redefinitions of sin, imputation, and atonement. He insisted that the immediate imputation of Adam's sin, total depravity as a moral inability, and a strictly substitutionary atonement were integral to the Westminster system. For Hodge, the trouble was not revival as such but the theological anthropology underneath the new measures and the institutional displacement of church courts by voluntary associations.

Conflicts sharpened in a series of trials. Albert Barnes of Philadelphia published Notes on Romans in 1835 and was accused of errors on original sin and justification. He was suspended by the Synod of Philadelphia in 1836, then became a rallying point for moderates who insisted that his theology fit within the system of doctrine. Lyman Beecher, a revivalist allied with the New School, was tried in Cincinnati in 1835 to 1836 on charges linked to New Haven doctrines and acquitted. Meanwhile presbyteries in the Western Reserve, formed under the Plan of Union, exhibited hybrid congregational and presbyterian features that Old School leaders judged irregular. The literature of the period reflects rising heat. Finney wrote as a practical theologian of moral suasion. Hodge replied as a confessional scholastic convinced that small shifts in terms would erode the gospel.

The break came in 1837. The Old School controlled the General Assembly that year and adopted the Exscinding Acts, which cut off four synods rooted in Plan of Union arrangements. The Assembly repudiated the 1801 Plan as unconstitutional and moved to centralize mission work under denominational boards. In response, New School leaders issued the Auburn Declaration in 1837, a set of affirmations that aimed to show fidelity to Westminster while allowing for Edwardsean and New Haven emphases. It affirmed the imputation of Adam's sin in a mediated sense, the reality of native depravity, and a vicarious atonement, while protecting teachings on natural ability and the free offer of the gospel. The Declaration did not persuade Old School jurists, who judged its formulations evasive. A separate New School General Assembly convened in 1838, completing the schism.

For two decades the denominations moved on separate tracks. The Old School leaned on Princeton divinity, disciplined revival methods, and boards directly accountable to General Assembly. The New School cultivated cooperation with Congregationalists, supported the American Home Missionary Society and the American Board, and maintained space for Taylorite and later Oberlin ideas. Finney moved to Oberlin and by the 1840s was defending perfectionist themes that alarmed both Old School and cautious New School voices. Social reform widened the gap. New School Presbyterians, especially in the North, networked with abolitionists and temperance advocates. Old School leaders, though diverse, tended to maintain ecclesiastical quietism on slavery and to keep synods intact across sectional lines.

The 1850s sorted the parties under the pressure of slavery. In 1857 the New School split along sectional lines, with southern New School Presbyterians forming their own organization. In 1861 the Old School Assembly adopted the Gardiner Spring Resolutions, which declared loyalty to the Federal Government. The result was a parallel Old School split as southern presbyteries withdrew and formed the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States. The war thus created four major Presbyterian bodies in the United States, two in the North and two in the South.

Ironically, war also made reunion in the North thinkable. By 1865 the central moral crisis that had divided New School activists from Old School quietists within the North had been resolved on the field of battle and in emancipation. New Haven theology had moderated, while the excesses of new measures had receded. The New School had long since declared in the Auburn Declaration that it held the Westminster system. On the Old School side, Hodge and colleagues had defended a robust Calvinism without insisting on rigid precisionism in every inference. A cohort of mediators, notably Henry Boynton Smith of Union Seminary, developed a language of evangelical catholicity that prized the system of doctrine while urging generosity on intramural debates.

Committees from both Assemblies met in 1867 to draft terms. The Basis of Union in 1869 committed the reunited church to the Scriptures as the rule of faith, the Westminster Confession as containing the system of doctrine, and Presbyterian government as scriptural. It granted liberty of opinion on points not essential to the system, pledged to respect existing theological seminaries, and provided for consolidated boards of home and foreign missions. Charles Hodge, who had written against New Haven innovations since the 1820s, supported the reunion as a vindication of confessional essentials with a prudent latitude on disputed scholastic points. Henry Boynton Smith, whose career from 1850s onward stood for a learned and irenic New School, championed the agreement as the recovery of unity for the sake of mission. In 1870 the two northern streams merged to form a strengthened Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. The southern bodies remained separate, and their reunion with the northern church would not occur until the late twentieth century, but the northern reunion set a template.

Theologically, the story clarifies how doctrinal systems operate in a living church. The Old School insisted that terms like imputation, depravity, and satisfaction marked nonnegotiable lines because they guarded the logic of grace. The New School contended that moral agency and the universal call to repentance required some reformulations. The Auburn Declaration shows a bid for continuity within development, while Princeton reviews show a bid for boundary drawing within catholicity. The reunion formula recovered a classic Presbyterian synthesis. It bound ministers to a confessional system rather than a catalog of propositions, protecting core soteriology and ecclesiology while allowing liberty in areas like the mode of imputation or theories of atonement not deemed essential.

Reception and legacy were significant. The reunited northern church consolidated mission boards, spurred home missions in the Reconstruction era, and expanded theological education. It also bequeathed a pattern. Defend the system of doctrine, tolerate diversity on nonessentials, and align denominational machinery for common work. That pattern framed later controversies, from the Briggs trial on biblical authority in 1893 to the fundamentalist modernist conflicts after 1910. In each case, the memory of 1837 and 1869 provided both a caution and a resource for negotiation.

In sum, the Old School and New School divided over a tangle of theology, polity, revival practice, and sectional allegiance, then reunited when the doctrinal center held and the social and institutional incentives aligned.
