### ESSAY
The Restoration of 1660 returned kings to two kingdoms that had dismantled episcopacy, sworn covenants, and experimented with rival church orders. Charles II promised healing and settling, and he pledged liberty to tender consciences in the Declaration of Breda of April 1660. Yet the road from promise to policy ran through Parliament, episcopal ambition, and popular memories of war and regicide. England and Scotland shared a Stuart dynasty but diverged sharply in church settlement, producing a common tension between uniformity and conscience, and two distinct institutional outcomes by 1688.

The causes are not hard to trace. During the 1640s the Westminster Assembly drafted a Presbyterian order for England and Wales, and Scotland had adopted a national covenant in 1638 and the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. Under Cromwell in the 1650s, a limited toleration allowed Congregationalists, Baptists, and Quakers to gather, even as Catholics and Episcopalians lacked open favor. When Charles returned, he had to unite partisan elites, reassure episcopalians, and control armed veterans. His opening strategy was to negotiate a mixed settlement through a conference of divines, hoping for comprehension rather than coercion.

The Savoy Conference of 1661 brought leading Presbyterians such as Richard Baxter and Edmund Calamy into formal debate with bishops led by Gilbert Sheldon and John Cosin. Baxter offered a Reformed liturgy that trimmed ceremonies and allowed latitude in subscription. The bishops rejected it, and after the elections of 1661 filled Parliament with royalists, the hope of comprehension faded. The result was the Act of Uniformity of May 1662. It required adherence to the revised Book of Common Prayer, episcopal ordination, and assent to articles and rites. On St Bartholomew's Day, 24 August 1662, roughly two thousand ministers left or were forced from their livings. The 1662 Prayer Book, with its robust Eucharistic theology and restored ceremonial, became the emblem of the established church.

Coercion hardened into a system through the so called Clarendon Code. The Corporation Act of 1661 restricted municipal office to communicants of the Church of England. The Quaker Act of 1662 and the Conventicle Act of 1664 targeted unauthorized worship, making repeated conventicles punishable by fines and imprisonment. The Five Mile Act of 1665 drove ejected ministers from the towns where their pastoral networks had been strongest. Sheldon as archbishop from 1663 embodied a Laudian temper stripped of some earlier innovations, insisting on episcopal discipline, catechesis, and sacramental order. Yet within the church a different note sounded, as Latitudinarians like John Tillotson, Edward Stillingfleet, and Simon Patrick commended a theology of reasonable assent and moral charity, and the Royal Society founded in 1660 promoted a culture of inquiry that encouraged natural theology and civil moderation.

Dissent did not vanish. Independents under John Owen defended gathered church principles in sermons and treatises. Baptists published confessions such as the Second London Confession of 1677, drawing from Westminster theology and covenantal frames. Quakers under George Fox and later William Penn suffered harsh penalties but argued that coercion could not bind conscience, and Penns No Cross No Crown began to circulate by 1669 in manuscript and 1682 in print. John Bunyan, arrested in 1660 and long imprisoned, wrote Grace Abounding in 1666 and later The Pilgrims Progress in 1678, a dissenting spiritual classic born of Restoration prisons.

Charles II sought to escape the trap of rigid uniformity by prerogative. In 1672 he issued a Declaration of Indulgence that suspended penal laws and allowed licensed dissenting worship. Parliament forced him to withdraw it and passed the Test Act of 1673, which required officeholders to receive the sacrament in the Church of England and to deny transubstantiation. The test targeted Catholic courtiers, not least the kings brother James Duke of York. Anti Catholic fear then surged with Titus Oatess Popish Plot in 1678, a fabricated conspiracy that led to executions and inflamed the nation. The Exclusion Crisis of 1679 to 1681 tried to bar James from the throne. When that failed, and when Charles governed without Parliament, the established church tightened its identification with crown and altar. William Sancroft as archbishop from 1677 embodied a dignified high churchmanship, wary of indulgence and jealous of ecclesial order.

Scotland moved along another track. The Parliament of 1661 passed the Rescissory Act, voiding legislation since 1633 and sweeping away the Covenanted settlement. The episcopate was restored in 1662, and James Sharp, once a Presbyterian negotiator, became Archbishop of St Andrews. Ministers who refused episcopal collation were ejected in 1662 and 1663, with hundreds displaced, especially in the southwest. The people who loved their pastors followed them to open air conventicles, sacraments in the fields, and disciplined fellowship meetings. The regime answered with fines, quartered troops, and coerced oaths. The Pentland Rising of 1666 ended in defeat at Rullion Green. Attempted moderation came in Indulgences in 1669 and 1672, which allowed selected ministers to preach under royal conditions. Moderate Presbyterians accepted, while strict Covenanters saw indulgence as a betrayal of Christs headship over the church.

The spiral sharpened after 1679. Archbishop Sharp was assassinated at Magus Muir that year. A larger Covenanter army gathered but was routed at Bothwell Bridge in June 1679. A radical remnant known as Society people or later Cameronians issued the Sanquhar Declaration in 1680, disowning the kings authority as unlawful until he submitted to Christs rule. Richard Cameron fell in battle at Airds Moss in 1680, and the movement endured leaderless but fierce. John Graham of Claverhouse, later Viscount Dundee, enforced the law with mounted dragoons, a period remembered as the Killing Times in 1684 and 1685. When James VII, also James II of England, acceded in 1685, he continued repression, then pivoted to toleration to aid Catholics. The Scottish Declaration for Liberty of Conscience of 1687 offered free exercise broadly, claimed under royal supremacy, and began to thaw the stalemate.

In England, James II pursued the same arc. He promoted Catholics by dispensing with the Test, issued a Declaration for Liberty of Conscience in 1687 and reissued it in 1688, and ordered it read in parish churches. Seven bishops, including Sancroft, petitioned against the order as illegal. Their trial in June 1688 ended in acquittal, a public relations disaster for the crown. The birth of a Catholic Prince of Wales that same month turned alarm into action. Politicians invited William of Orange to land. By December, James fled, and the English and Scottish settlements moved to revolutionary conclusions.

The theological stakes of these decades were not merely institutional. In England, debates over comprehension versus uniformity forced reflection on adiaphora, on the extent of lawful ceremonies, and on the claims of an Erastian state to prescribe rites. The Prayer Book of 1662, with its lectionary, litany, and robust confirmation of baptismal and eucharistic practice, gave Anglican piety its durable grammar. Latitudinarians refined a theology of reason, charity, and moral transformation, influencing catechesis and preaching. Dissenters articulated a powerful gospel of conscience. Owen defended the autonomy of the gathered church and the sufficiency of Scripture. Baxter crafted a pastoral theology aimed at reformation of manners, even as he refused to conform in 1662. Quaker testimonies to the inward light challenged oath taking and tithes, adding a distinctive peace witness. In Scotland, covenant theology sustained a political ecclesiology in which Christ reigned as King over both church and nation, and resistance was framed as fidelity, drawing on earlier texts such as Rutherford's Lex Rex and on the 1640s discipline of presbyteries and sessions.

The legacy by 1688 was paradoxical. In England the Church of England survived intact, yet it had generated a permanent class of Protestant Dissenters who built meeting houses, schools, and print networks. The Toleration Act of 1689 would grant qualified freedom to Trinitarian dissenters while leaving the Test in place. Nonjurors would refuse oaths to William and Mary and form a high church remnant. In Scotland the Revolution Settlement of 1690 would abolish episcopacy and restore a Presbyterian establishment, with Episcopalians becoming a separate minority often tied to Jacobitism. The literature of the period endured, not least Bunyans Pilgrims Progress, Quaker apologetics, and Anglican sermons that would shape eighteenth century moral religion.

Thus the Restoration remade religion under the pressure of order and conscience, producing an English establishment tempered by toleration and a Scottish Presbyterian nation, two settlements born of one dynasty and a turbulent generation.
