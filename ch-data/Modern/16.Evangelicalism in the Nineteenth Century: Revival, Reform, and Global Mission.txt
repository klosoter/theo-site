### ESSAY
When observers in 1900 looked back over the nineteenth century, they could trace a single bright thread running through English speaking Protestantism and far beyond. Evangelicalism made the case that personal conversion to Christ, the authority of Scripture, and active service in the world should define the Christian life. Yet that thread was frayed by modern pressures, new sciences, contested politics, and the vast ambitions of global empire. The story of nineteenth-century evangelicalism is the story of how revival piety became a social force and a world missionary movement, while wrestling with the risks of cultural domination and theological fragmentation.

The backdrop lay in the late eighteenth century. Methodist and evangelical awakenings since the 1730s had prepared the soil, and new voluntary societies emerged in the 1790s to carry the message beyond confessional and national lines. The London Missionary Society began in 1795, the Church Missionary Society in 1799, the Religious Tract Society in 1799, and the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804. Similar energies drove the American Bible Society in 1816 and the American Tract Society in 1825. Disestablishment and democratic politics in the United States after 1789 opened a competitive religious marketplace. Industrialization and urban migration in Britain and the Atlantic world crowded people into towns that were ripe for new forms of preaching, schooling, and organized charity.

The Second Great Awakening set the early nineteenth-century pattern. The Cane Ridge camp meeting in Kentucky in 1801 dramatized the mass, emotive potential of revival. By the 1820s and 1830s Charles Grandison Finney deployed urban protracted meetings, the anxious bench, and direct appeals to the will. His Lectures on Revivals of Religion, published in 1835, argued that revivals were the use of means appointed by God, not miraculous anomalies. He linked conversion to social reform, especially temperance and abolition. In Britain a more ordered revivalism advanced through itinerant preaching, Sunday schools, and a web of societies. The tone was set by the so-called evangelical party in the Church of England, with figures such as John Newton and Hannah More continuity with earlier piety, and in the public sphere by William Wilberforce and the Clapham network.

Reform and philanthropy were not mere add-ons. Evangelicals insisted that the cross produced moral transformation in persons and communities. Parliament abolished the British slave trade in 1807, a signal victory shaped by evangelical conscience, and the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 ended slavery across the empire. Evangelicals backed factory legislation, poor relief reform, Sabbatarian campaigns, education for the working classes, and temperance. The YMCA arose in 1844 to integrate piety and urban welfare, joined by the YWCA in 1855. Catherine and William Booth launched the Christian Mission in London in 1865, adopting the name Salvation Army in 1878, evangelizing the poor with brass bands and relief programs. William Booths In Darkest England, published in 1890, proposed a holistic scheme for bread, work, and salvation.

Preaching and print defined the evangelical public. Charles Haddon Spurgeon, pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle from 1854, filled a six-thousand-seat auditorium by 1861 and sent weekly sermons around the world. His Calvinistic Baptist orthodoxy clashed with looser currents in the Downgrade Controversy of 1887 to 1888, when he warned that concessions to higher criticism and liberal theology placed churches on the downgrade. Across the Atlantic, Dwight L. Moody modeled a new pattern of mass evangelism. His campaigns in Britain in 1873 to 1875 and in American cities thereafter emphasized simple gospel preaching, lay cooperation across denominations, and follow-up through inquiry rooms and personal work. Ira D. Sankeys gospel music unified crowds and carried doctrine in song.

Global mission became the century's hallmark. Though the spark owed much to earlier pioneers such as William Carey, eighteenth-century Baptist advocate for India, the nineteenth century institutionalized and scaled the project. The 1813 Charter Act opened British India to missionary entry. Henry Venn, honorary secretary of the Church Missionary Society from the 1840s to 1872, and Rufus Anderson of the American Board from the 1830s onward, articulated the three-self principle, self-supporting, self-governing, self-propagating churches, as a goal for mission. Samuel Ajayi Crowther, consecrated bishop on the Niger in 1864, embodied that ideal through translation, education, and the push for indigenous leadership, though later retrenchment exposed tensions within the missionary establishment. Hudson Taylor founded the China Inland Mission in 1865, a faith mission relying on prayer for finance, focused on inland provinces and cultural adaptation including local dress. The Cambridge Seven sailed in 1885 under its banner, signaling elite commitment and student mobilization. The Student Volunteer Movement launched in 1886 with the watchword, the evangelization of the world in this generation.

Holiness currents reshaped evangelical spirituality. Phoebe Palmer led Tuesday Meetings for the Promotion of Holiness beginning in 1835 and published The Way of Holiness in 1845, teaching immediate entire sanctification by consecration and faith. This accelerated doctrine spread through Methodism, then into new holiness associations and denominations. The Keswick Convention, first held in 1875, forged a higher life synthesis with a focus on consecration, victorious Christian living, and service. These currents would feed early Pentecostalism in the next century.

Revival recurred midcentury. The businessmans prayer meetings of 1857 to 1858, associated with Jeremiah Lanphier in New York, turned noon-hour gatherings into a citywide movement. In 1859 awakenings in Ulster and Wales stirred thousands, marked by lay testimonies, prayer, and the call to conversion. These renewals energized missions but also met new intellectual headwinds. Darwin's On the Origin of Species appeared in 1859. Essays and Reviews in 1860 introduced higher critical approaches among Anglicans. Evangelical theologians at Princeton, especially Charles Hodge with his Systematic Theology published 1872 to 1873, defended the inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture, while some British and American evangelicals experimented with harmonization or theistic evolution. The resulting spectrum did not break the movement, but it widened internal diversity and set the stage for sharper battles in the early twentieth century.

Politics fractured American evangelicalism over slavery. Methodist and Baptist denominations split in 1844 and 1845, forming the Methodist Episcopal Church South and the Southern Baptist Convention. Wartime and Reconstruction recast evangelical public witness. African American believers built independent denominations, including the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded in 1816 by Richard Allen and later the National Baptist Convention in 1895, carrying revival piety and social self-help. In Britain, evangelicals contended with the Oxford Movement from 1833, which sought catholic renewal within Anglicanism, sharpening evangelical identity within the Church of England. The Evangelical Alliance, organized in London in 1846, created a transnational platform for unity in essentials, cooperation in mission, and advocacy of religious liberty.

Theologically, nineteenth-century evangelicalism coalesced around four habits of mind often cited by later historians. First, conversionism, a stress on the new birth as decisive, dramatized in testimonies and altar calls. Second, crucicentrism, a focus on the atoning work of Christ, with substitutionary theories dominant in preaching and hymnody. Third, biblicism, treating Scripture as the supreme authority for doctrine and devotion, disseminated by cheap print and family worship. Fourth, activism, the conviction that faith must work through societies, charities, schools, and missions. These habits carried strengths and liabilities. They democratized access to grace and vocation, invited women into leadership especially in missions and holiness circles, and created flexible networks agile in a changing world. They also risked individualism, uneven ecclesiology, and complicity with imperial power.

By 1900 evangelicalism had achieved a paradoxical settlement. It possessed a vast infrastructure of presses, colleges, missions, and conferences. It had learned to stage urban campaigns and to mobilize youth. It had planted churches across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, translated Bibles, and fostered local leaders even as paternalism too often constrained them. It had shown how moral reform could spring from conversion, yet it had suffered schisms and faced a gathering challenge from critical scholarship and secularizing cultures. The seeds of both fundamentalist resistance and ecumenical collaboration were in the ground.

Nineteenth-century evangelicalism fused revival, reform, and mission into a global Protestant style that proved remarkably generative in the modern world.
