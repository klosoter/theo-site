### ESSAY
Ask when the modernist controversy in the United States came to a head, and the answer spans two arenas at once. In Protestant communions, a battle over Scripture, creed, and culture ran from the 1890s through the 1930s. In Catholic circles, a related but differently managed struggle unfolded under papal oversight from 1899 through the first decades of the twentieth century. Across both, the question was the same. Could the historic faith be restated under the pressure of modern historical criticism and the natural sciences, or must it be defended against those pressures as a system already given and complete.

The background is the rise of professionalized research universities, the spread of Darwinian evolution after 1859, the import of German historical criticism, and the moral urgency of the Social Gospel in an urban industrial nation. Pastors read Wellhausen and Harnack. Churches founded seminaries attached to universities. The language of progress and scientific method moved from laboratory and lecture hall into pulpits and presbyteries. By the 1890s the ground was set for test cases.

One early Protestant flashpoint was the Presbyterian trial of Charles A. Briggs in New York, 1891 to 1893. Briggs argued that inerrancy was not the doctrine of the Westminster Standards, that Scripture was authoritative yet bore human marks, and that historical criticism could serve the church. The General Assembly deposed him in 1893. That verdict did not end higher criticism in America, but it fixed a line in Presbyterian polity. Formal assemblies would decide the bounds of acceptable teaching, not only local presbyteries or seminaries.

A second cluster of moments came with the publication of The Fundamentals between 1910 and 1915, funded by Lyman and Milton Stewart. The tract series promoted core teachings, often summarized as five fundamentals. The 1910 General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America issued a deliverance naming the virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, bodily resurrection of Jesus, the miracles, and the inerrancy of Scripture as required doctrines. Premillennial expectation, sharpened by the Scofield Reference Bible in 1909, knit into this conservative front, offering an eschatological critique of liberal optimism.

Modernist energy crystallized in preaching and in academic theology. Harry Emerson Fosdick, a Baptist serving at First Presbyterian Church in New York, preached the sermon Shall the Fundamentalists Win in May 1922. He pleaded for latitude on the virgin birth and on the mode of biblical inspiration, arguing that Christianity could not be tied to a single theory of atonement or a nineteenth century doctrine of inerrancy. Clarence Macartney answered from Philadelphia with Shall Unbelief Win, and the 1923 General Assembly pressed the Presbytery of New York to require Fosdick either to conform or withdraw. He resigned in 1924 and soon preached at the new Riverside Church, completed in 1930 with Rockefeller patronage. Meanwhile Shailer Mathews at the University of Chicago articulated the theological case for modernism in The Faith of Modernism in 1924, framing Christianity as a living movement subject to historical development.

Presbyterians produced the Auburn Affirmation in 1924, a document signed by more than a thousand ministers. It defended liberty within the church, questioned the Assemblys authority to impose the five points as tests of ordination, and insisted that multiple theories of inspiration and atonement were consistent with the confessional heritage. This attempt to hold unity by loosening doctrinal enforcement marked a key modernist victory within the mainline. It also intensified conservative distrust of national machinery.

The public took notice in Dayton, Tennessee, with the Scopes Trial in July 1925. John Scopes stood accused of teaching evolution in violation of a state law. William Jennings Bryan spoke for the prosecution. Clarence Darrow cross examined with skill before a listening nation. The court ruled against Scopes, yet the media verdict painted fundamentalism as anti intellectual and on the defensive. That portrayal affected church debates by shifting cultural capital toward modernist positions in urban and academic centers.

A decisive institutional turn came at Princeton Theological Seminary. Under B. B. Warfield, who died in 1921, Princeton represented the Princeton Theology, a learned defense of inerrancy, confessional orthodoxy, and the harmony of faith and reason rightly understood. As trustees and faculty divided after Warfields death, the General Assembly reorganized Princeton in 1929 to broaden its theological base. J. Gresham Machen, a leading conservative voice and the author of Christianity and Liberalism in 1923, left to found Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929. The split signaled that the controversy was no longer only rhetorical. Institutions themselves would bear the cost of alignment.

Machen then organized the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions in 1933 to counter what he regarded as modernist drift in official mission policy. Tried and suspended by the PCUSA in 1935, he and allies formed the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936. These dates anchor the conservative move from protest within the mainline to separatist church founding. In the Northern Baptist Convention, William Bell Riley and others failed to secure a binding confession in the 1920s. Conservatives formed the Baptist Bible Union in 1923, and separatists created the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches in 1932. Modernists such as Mathews sustained influence within denominational boards and seminaries, while congregational polity in Baptist life allowed local variation and gradual fracturing.

The Catholic story moved differently. Pope Leo XIII issued Testem Benevolentiae in 1899, cautioning against an exaggerated Americanism that seemed to favor active virtues over contemplation and to revise doctrine to fit modern civil life. Pope Pius X then defined and policed modernism with Lamentabili and Pascendi in 1907 and required the Anti Modernist Oath in 1910. In the United States, the case of John Zahm, a Holy Cross priest whose Evolution and Dogma appeared in 1896, showed the limits. His attempt to reconcile Catholic teaching and evolutionary science was withdrawn under Roman pressure in 1898. Catholic University faculty learned the lesson. Biblical scholarship and historical theology proceeded, yet under strong Roman supervision and with cautious rhetoric. The modernist crisis in American Catholicism thus produced less public courtroom drama and more durable institutional constraint, with a long shadow until mid century.

What did these moments decide. Theologically, they fixed terms of debate about inspiration, inerrancy, miracles, atonement, and eschatology, and they forced hard reflection on the difference between gospel and culture. Sociologically, they accelerated the divergence of mainline and conservative networks. Princeton to Westminster, PCUSA to OPC, Northern Baptist Convention to GARBC, these shifts gave structure to American Protestant pluralism. Intellectually, they changed American seminaries. Academic biblical criticism became normal in mainline schools. Confessional seminaries built counter networks of publications and conferences. The Social Gospel, dented by war and depression, yielded to a chastened liberalism in the work of Reinhold and H. Richard Niebuhr in the 1930s, while fundamentalists nursed a press wary posture after Dayton.

Reception and legacy stretch beyond the 1930s. A new evangelical coalition, represented by the National Association of Evangelicals in 1942 and by figures such as Harold Ockenga and later Billy Graham, sought to retain orthodox doctrine while reentering public scholarship and media. That neo evangelical turn is unthinkable apart from the earlier modernist battles over culture and the academy. On the Catholic side, the anti modernist regime framed the intellectual climate until the middle of the twentieth century, and only after the 1950s did official encouragement of historical and biblical studies widen. The American controversy thus left two tracks. A Protestant field marked by institutional differentiation and alternating strategies of engagement and separation, and a Catholic field marked by centralized discipline followed by a later measured opening.

Name the key moments, then, and you name courtrooms, pulpits, assemblies, seminaries, and papal decrees, all working out the question of how an ancient faith lives with modern knowledge.
