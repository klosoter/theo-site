### ESSAY
Begin with a picture. A scholar in exile reads the Greek New Testament by candlelight, then turns to his pressman and says, Let it be English. His aim is not ornament but judgment and grace in the tongue of ploughmen. That scholar is William Tyndale, active from the early 1520s until his death in 1536, and his wager is that divine truth, once heard in English, will shake the old order and rebuild the church on apostolic foundations. The tension is immediate. Royal policy in London proclaims the king as defender of the faith in 1521 and bans Lutheran books, while the ports of the Rhine offer presses, patrons, and flight. Tyndale chooses flight, and through his choices he creates the sound and substance of the English Reformation.

The formation of Tyndale's program belongs to a convergence of forces. Late medieval Oxford and Cambridge had transmitted Wycliffite memory, though proscribed, and trained a grammar-minded clergy. Humanism supplied tools. Erasmus published the Greek New Testament in 1516, with revised Latin and philological notes, and thereby invited Europe to correct theology at the source. Luther's theses in 1517 and his tracts of 1520 put justification by faith at the center and attacked sacerdotal power. Henry VIII moved against Lutheranism, yet his court contained readers eager for reform and a queen who would soon press evangelical books upon him. In 1523 Tyndale sought a London patron for an English New Testament and was refused by Bishop Tunstall. By 1524 he left for the Continent. A first printing at Cologne in 1525 was exposed by Johannes Cochlaeus and halted. Tyndale slipped downriver to Worms and issued the English New Testament in 1526, small, cheap, and portable.

Tyndale's theology begins with Scripture. He is not a mere translator. He interprets with every lexical choice and with every preface and marginal note. Three choices became a program. He wrote elder rather than priest for presbyteros, congregation rather than church for ekklesia, and love rather than charity for agape in 1 Corinthians 13. The point was not novelty but alignment with apostolic use and a cleansing of language that had been freighted by medieval usage. Elder dislodged sacerdotal office in favor of pastoral oversight. Congregation named the gathered people rather than a juridical institution. Love shifted moral theology from meritorious habit to the living bond of faith active in charity. He rendered metanoeo as repent rather than do penance, recovering a turning of heart to God rather than a sacramental tariff. He translated hilasterion as mercy seat to weave the atonement into the history of God's covenant with Israel. In these moves, Tyndale crafted an English lexicon for doctrine that would be received from the ploughman to the privy council.

His treatises between 1528 and 1531 set out the system behind the translation. The Parable of the Wicked Mammon in 1528 argues that faith alone justifies, yet true faith always bears fruit. Borrowing from Luther yet chastened by pastoral concern, he teaches that the gospel grants Christ's righteousness, and the believer, freed from the bondage of merit, learns the obedience of gratitude. Obedience of a Christian Man in 1528 advances a political theology. God ordains rulers to keep peace and punish evildoers. Bishops had swollen beyond their office, and the papacy had seized temporal dominion. Tyndale urges royal supremacy in spiritual governance within the realm, not to sacralize the crown, but to break foreign jurisdiction that had fortified abuses. The Practice of Prelates in 1530 lays bare the machinery of ecclesiastical power and marks the Pope as Antichrist not by invective only but by a chain of scriptural and historical arguments. His Answer unto Sir Thomas More in 1531 replies to More's Dialogue concerning Heresies. The two men share a humanist training, yet their quarrel is foundational. More trusts the church as visible authority. Tyndale insists Scripture, clear in its core, norms the church, and the Spirit opens the text to the humble through preaching.

On the sacraments Tyndale reduces their number to two, baptism and the Lord's Supper, both instituted by Christ with visible signs joined to promises. In the Supper he rejects transubstantiation, seeing in it a metaphysical net that loses the gospel promise. He affirms a true participation in Christ by faith, a spiritual feeding in which the sign exhibits what it declares. The sacramental debate mattered not as subtlety alone, but as a school for assurance. If Christ is given in the promise, then the believer looks not to the fluctuations of inner devotion but to the Word and sign where Christ binds himself to be found.

Tyndale's pastoral method is law and gospel. He is blunt about sin. The law names our condition, exposes proud works, and drives to Christ. The gospel comforts the conscience with the announcement that God justifies the ungodly for Christ's sake. This rhythm organizes his prologues and prefaces, where he sets readers within salvation history, sketches the argument of each biblical book, and warns against false trust. His notes urge ordinary Christians to test all teaching against apostolic Scripture and to endure reproach for the truth.

Two turning points fixed Tyndale's place in the English Reformation. First, his revised New Testament of 1534 showed the maturing of his scholarship and style, with stronger renderings and a richer apparatus of notes. This edition was the basis for subsequent English Bibles. Second, his arrest near Antwerp in 1535, followed by imprisonment at Vilvoorde and execution by strangling and burning in October 1536, turned his life into testimony. Tradition gives his last words as a prayer that the Lord would open the king of England's eyes. Within two years, the English crown authorized the Great Bible. Miles Coverdale and later editors drew heavily on Tyndale's work for that Bible in 1539 and for later editions. Thus the death of the translator prepared the enthronement of his sentences in parish choirs.

The theological significance of Tyndale's work is layered. He furnished English evangelicalism with a canonical criterion. Scripture is sufficient, clear in its saving core, and self interpreting in the light of Christ. That claim shaped the tenor of debate in England, not only among reformers but also among their opponents, who increasingly argued by appeal to antiquity and text. He settled a doctrine of justification that moved into the Edwardian Homilies in 1547 and into Article 11 of the Thirty nine Articles in 1563, which declares that we are justified by faith only. He offered a template for polity in which the crown displaces papal jurisdiction, a theology that Henry VIII acted upon in the Act of Supremacy in 1534, even if the king did not embrace Tyndale's full evangelical program. He hammered out an evangelical view of the sacraments that later English divines such as Cranmer and Jewel refined, pushing the church toward a Reformed account of the Supper as spiritual feeding and toward a baptism anchored in promise.

Reception tells the story of mission accomplished beyond the man. Under Henry VIII, bishops like Tunstall condemned Tyndale's New Testament in 1526 and burned copies at St Paul's Cross, but the burning bought more copies. Under Edward VI, evangelical preaching flourished, and Tyndale's doctrine became the common tongue of reform in England. Under Mary I, Tyndale's memory steadied martyrs such as John Bradford, who taught assurance and predestination with a Tyndalian cadence and died in 1555. The Geneva Bible of 1560, made by Marian exiles, owed much to Tyndale's renderings and to his method of annotation. The Authorised Version of 1611 kept a remarkable portion of Tyndale's sentences. Scholars have estimated that in the New Testament the share is very high, so that Tyndale's English became the English of scripture for centuries. With that English came a framework of theology. Congregation, elder, love, repentance, promise, and mercy seat are not only words. They are a map of reality in which God speaks and saves.

What then is Tyndale's contribution to English Reformation theology. He made the Bible English in a way that carried doctrine within it. He supplied the grammar of justification, the comfort of the gospel, the discipline of law, and the scale of salvation history. He drew the church away from sacerdotal mediation toward the preached Word and the sacraments as enacted promise. He gave a political theology that, for all its risks, freed England from foreign jurisdiction and tied reform to royal responsibility. And he wrote with a simplicity that the child could learn and the scholar admire. The result is that for English Christianity, doctrine arrived as Scripture spoken aloud, and the voice was Tyndale's.
