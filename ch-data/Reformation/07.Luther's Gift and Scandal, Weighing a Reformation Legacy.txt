### ESSAY
The question is stark and unavoidable. How should one weigh the theological gifts of Martin Luther, the doctrine of justification by faith and the reform of worship and catechesis, against his savage writings against Jews and his blood hot denunciations of the peasants in 1525. Is he a net gain for Christian faith or an unhappy liability. The answer requires a precise account of what he gave, why he wrote as he did against certain neighbors, and how later Christians received both.

Luther rose within a late medieval Church marked by administrative entanglements, penitential economies, and a learned theology that had grown elaborate and often scholastic in tone. In 1517 he published the 95 Theses, seeking a disputation about indulgences and the power of the keys. That act was a spark in tinder. By 1520 Luther had articulated a compact reformation program in three treatises. The Address to the Christian Nobility called temporal rulers to reform ecclesial abuses where bishops failed. The Babylonian Captivity of the Church reduced the sacraments to those grounded in Christ's promise, baptism and the Lord's Supper chiefly, and recast the mass as gospel testament rather than priestly offering. On the Freedom of a Christian combined robust assurance in Christ with neighbor serving vocation. At Worms in 1521 he refused to recant, and under the protection of Frederick the Wise he translated the New Testament into vigorous German in 1522, with the complete Bible appearing in 1534. His catechisms of 1529 shaped household teaching by the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the sacraments.

These works gave European Christianity an evangelical core. Justification by faith alone, grounded in Christ's once for all work, reset the conscience. Sola scriptura made the prophetic and apostolic witness the decisive norm for doctrine and worship. Law and gospel distinguished divine accusation from divine promise, clarifying the work of preaching. Vocation located holiness in ordinary callings, the farm, shop, city office, and nursery. The two kingdoms teaching, what he called the two regiments, distinguished Christ's reign through the gospel from the needed governance of the temporal order. Melanchthon systematized this program in the Augsburg Confession of 1530, and Luther affirmed it in the Schmalkald Articles of 1537.

The same years, however, brought social crisis. Economic pressure, changing seigneurial rights, and evangelical rhetoric about Christian freedom stirred the German Peasants War in 1524 to 1525. The Twelve Articles of the Upper Swabian peasants appealed to gospel freedom and fairness in tithes, hunting, and judicial practice. Luther first wrote Admonition to Peace in early 1525, rebuking both lords and peasants and urging negotiated settlement. When violence intensified, he published Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants in May 1525, calling on princes to put down the revolt with the sword. The tract is blistering, and it appealed to Romans 13 and his two kingdoms distinction to insist that the magistrate bears responsibility to restore order. He condemned the rebels as blasphemers who cloaked violence in the gospel. The uprising was crushed, and blood stained the fields. Luther later lamented the cruelty of the suppression in places, yet he did not retract the core argument.

On the Jews Luther's trajectory was also stark. In 1523 he authored That Jesus Christ Was Born a Jew, a text urging Christians to treat Jews with kindness and to present the gospel without coercion. He hoped that abuses by Christians had hindered conversion and that clear preaching would bear fruit. Two decades later, in 1543, frustrated by polemical exchanges and hardened by apocalyptic worries, he published On the Jews and Their Lies. The work is a sustained invective that called for the destruction of synagogues and schools, the seizure of rabbinic books, and the restriction of Jewish livelihoods. This is not a mere lapse of language. It urged concrete measures that were already practiced in parts of Europe and that would later be mobilized by modern antisemitism. His late treatise On the Last Words of David, also in 1543, continued the line, and his 1546 sermon on Psalm 82 still sang in the same register.

How then to weigh the balance. Begin with theological and ecclesial gains. If the question is about the doctrine of God in Christ, about the gift of assurance, about the clarity of the gospel, Luther is a monumental gain. His expositions of Psalms and Romans in the 1510s and 1520s, his 1521 lectures on Galatians echoed in the 1535 commentary, gave generations a grammar of grace that cut through accumulations of merit and fear. He restored congregational singing, issued a German mass in 1526, and put the word of God into the home through catechisms and Scripture in the vernacular. His sacramental teaching kept baptism as divine pledge and made the Supper an enacted promise that consoles troubled consciences. The evangelical churches he helped launch built schools, trained pastors, and reshaped civic charity. Even the Catholic Church, through the Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563, responded with reforms that sharpened teaching and renewed discipline, a counter reformation and internal renewal that rose in dialectical relation to Luther's challenge.

Now set alongside these gifts the social and ethical failures. Luther's 1525 pamphlet licensed the sword against peasants in ways that fused his theology of vocation with a harsh reading of civil obedience. It narrowed moral imagination under crisis. His 1543 diatribe against Jews is a lasting scandal. No responsible historical account can sever that text from subsequent German history. Modern racial antisemitism is not the same as medieval anti Judaism, and Luther is not the architect of the nineteenth century ideologues. Yet the fact remains that his authority was invoked by later antisemites in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and that Nazi propaganda quoted him in 1933 and 1938. Lutheran churches in Germany and elsewhere have since repudiated those writings, and late twentieth century statements confessed the sin with clarity. The pathology cannot be omitted from the ledger.

Several turning points concentrate the dilemma. In 1525, the collision of gospel rhetoric with social revolt forced a field test of the two kingdoms teaching. Luther chose order over revolt, and his tone gave princes a thick warrant. In 1543, his polemics hardened into policy proposals against Jews, not simply theological argument about Christology and Scripture. In each case, his theological framework was at play, yet so too were temperamental limits, the polemical conventions of his age, and the dangers of a reformer who was also a public figure in a fractious empire.

Historians have parsed these layers. Some stress continuity, noting how his zealous care for the first commandment, you shall have no other gods, could fuel an intolerance for rival religious communities. Others stress discontinuity, pointing to a younger Luther willing to risk friendship and persuasion, and an older Luther marked by illness, political frustration after 1530, and a sharpened apocalyptic sense as the Ottoman threat and imperial politics pressed in. Both accounts remind us that the reception of a reformer must be discerning. Traditions are not static inheritances. They involve principled retrieval and confessed rejection.

So, net gain or unhappy liability. As Christian faith, considered theologically and pastorally, Luther's core teaching is a profound gain. Justification by faith alone, law and gospel, the sufficiency of Scripture, and pastoral care through word and sacrament have fed the church across centuries and continents. As social ethic and interreligious posture, Luther brings liabilities that require ongoing repentance and correction. The church can and must retain the evangelical goods while explicitly rejecting the counsel he gave against Jews and the ferocity he leveled at the peasants. To do so is not to pick and choose carelessly. It is to submit even the reformer to the judgment of the gospel he preached. That, finally, is the most Lutheran move of all.
