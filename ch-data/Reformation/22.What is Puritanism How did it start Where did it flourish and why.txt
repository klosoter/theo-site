### ESSAY
What is Puritanism, and why did it matter so fiercely that it redrew church life on both sides of the Atlantic The term itself was polemical, used by opponents to describe the hotter sort of Protestant who pressed beyond the Elizabethan Settlement toward a church more strictly ordered by Scripture. Puritanism is best defined as a reforming impulse within English Reformed Protestantism that sought a purified worship, a disciplined ministry and people, and a godly commonwealth, all under the rule of the Word. It began in the later sixteenth century, it flourished where law, print, and migration gave it space to breathe, and it left an enduring theological and institutional legacy.

The movement arose from a series of unsettled settlements. The Edwardian Reformation of 1549-1553, guided by Thomas Cranmer, moved England decisively toward a Reformed liturgy. Mary Tudor reversed course in 1553, sending hundreds of exiles to Zurich, Frankfurt, and Geneva. Those exiles returned under Elizabeth I in 1558 with a Genevan accent on worship and discipline. The Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity in 1559 reestablished royal supremacy and authorized a revised Book of Common Prayer, aiming for a middle way. For ministers shaped in Zurich and Geneva, the Settlement preserved too much ceremony, set forms, and episcopal prerogative. The vestiarian controversy of 1565-1566, over surplice and cap, was not about fabric but about authority and conscience. Could the church bind what Scripture did not require Puritan answers tended to no, a negative that would become the regulative principle of worship.

By the 1570s the movement developed a coherent program. The Admonition to the Parliament of 1572, tied to Thomas Cartwright, sketched a presbyterian order with congregational elderships, classes, and synods to replace episcopal courts. Walter Travers and others worked to plant classes discreetly in the 1580s. John Whitgift, archbishop from 1583, suppressed these efforts, yet a broader Puritan piety spread through preaching. Cambridge was the seedbed. William Perkins, teaching at Christ's College and preaching at Great St Andrews, produced A Golden Chain in 1591 and a stream of practical treatises. He used the schematic clarity of Ramism to bind doctrine and casuistry to pastoral application. Richard Greenham at Dry Drayton trained ministers in catechesis and family worship. Emmanuel College, founded in 1584, became a Puritan nursery for clergy who would steer parish life through the pulpit rather than the altar.

The turn of the century brought royal attention but not royal reform. The Millenary Petition of 1603 asked James I for preaching pastors, discipline by elders, and a purged liturgy. At the Hampton Court Conference in 1604, James answered with the kingship of bishops and granted mainly a new Bible, the Authorized Version of 1611, not structural change. Archbishop Bancroft enforced conformity. Yet the movement internationalized. English delegates such as John Davenant attended the Synod of Dort in 1618-1619, which condemned Arminian views and affirmed doctrines of grace that Puritans held dear. William Ames, exiled to the Dutch Republic, published Medulla Theologiae in 1623, a concise Reformed system that shaped ministers from London to Massachusetts. Ames also wrote on conscience and cases of conscience, consolidating the Puritan craft of directing souls.

Under Charles I the conflict sharpened. From 1625 the crown favored ceremonialist and Arminian clergy. William Laud rose to Canterbury in 1633 and pressed for rails, altars, and uniform ceremonial, backed by the High Commission and Star Chamber. Ministers who resisted were suspended or imprisoned. Laudian policy compressed Puritan life in England like a spring. At the same time it opened exits. In 1620 separatists had sailed to New England. A larger wave followed in the 1630s, the Great Migration under John Winthrop and company to Massachusetts Bay in 1630. In New England, ministers such as John Cotton and Thomas Hooker built congregational polities, insisted on a gathered church of visible saints, and drafted the Cambridge Platform in 1648, which defined the New England Way. Hooker led a colony to Connecticut in 1636 and helped shape a constitutional order in 1639. Winthrop's sermon of 1630, A Modell of Christian Charity, framed the migration as a corporate covenant project, a city on a hill.

War altered the English scene. The Civil Wars from 1642 to 1651 toppled episcopacy and convened the Westminster Assembly in 1643. That body of English and Scottish divines drafted the Westminster Confession in 1646, along with Larger and Shorter Catechisms in 1647 and the Directory for Public Worship in 1645. These documents, forged amid siege and debate, codified Reformed doctrine and a Word centered liturgical order. Within the wider movement, differences widened. Presbyterians favored national synods and settled parish discipline. Independents, including many New Model Army officers, argued for congregational autonomy under Christ's kingship. Baptists pressed for believer's baptism. Yet all shared core traits, the sufficiency of Scripture, the supremacy of preaching, the Sabbath, and a strenuous moral vision. Oliver Cromwell's Protectorate from 1653 to 1658 installed Triers and Ejectors in 1654 to evaluate ministers for godliness and ability, an institutional nod to Puritan ideals.

The Restoration of Charles II in 1660 reversed the gains. The Act of Uniformity in 1662 ejected roughly two thousand ministers who could not assent to the restored Prayer Book and episcopal ordination. This Great Ejection marked a decisive turning point. Puritanism ceased to be a reforming party within and became a family of Dissenters without, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists. Richard Baxter, who had labored for a broad comprehension, turned to pastoral writing such as The Reformed Pastor in 1656 and Saints Everlasting Rest in 1650. John Owen developed high Reformed theology and churchmanship during and after the wars. John Bunyan, imprisoned in Bedford, wrote The Pilgrims Progress in 1678, a spiritual allegory steeped in Puritan piety. In 1689 the Toleration Act granted limited liberty to Trinitarian Dissenters, closing the age of coercive uniformity but not the Puritan project of piety.

What made Puritanism flourish where it did Three kinds of soil fed its roots. First, institutional space. In late Tudor England, uniformity laws coexisted with a parish system hungry for preaching and with universities that trained able ministers. Cambridge networks, patronage from godly gentry, and a vigorous print culture created channels for Puritan books and sermons. Emmanuel College especially became a pipeline for preachers across London, East Anglia, and the West Country. The Dutch Republic offered safe harbor for exiles, as in Ames's case, and for English congregations in Leiden and Amsterdam. Second, political opportunity. War and regime change in the 1640s made room for experiments in polity, culminating in the Westminster standards and congregational platforms. Third, migration. In New England, a colony largely led by Puritan laity and clergy could construct covenanted towns, enforce sabbaths, support schools such as Harvard in 1636, and test practical divinity in law and custom. There Puritanism was not a pressure group but a social architecture.

Theologically, Puritanism refined Reformed orthodoxy into a practical science of living unto God. Covenant theology organized Scripture, moving from the covenant of works given to Adam to the covenant of grace fulfilled in Christ, and then to federal ways of ordering church and commonwealth. The regulative principle trimmed worship to the Word, preaching, prayer, psalm singing, and sacraments. Preachers adopted a plain style, opening the text, drawing doctrines, and pressing uses upon conscience. Casuistry, the art of cases of conscience, helped believers discern assurance and duty without collapsing grace into moralism. Discipline mattered, not as a punitive system, but as mutual oversight for a holy people. The Sabbath became a weekly rehearsal of creation and redemption, guarded by laws and habits.

Reception and legacy stretched far beyond the seventeenth century. In England, Puritan divinity fed eighteenth century Evangelicalism through Isaac Watts, Philip Doddridge, and John Newton. In Scotland, the Westminster standards became confessional bedrock, though the Scottish story had its own trajectory from Knox to the Covenanters. In New England, the Half Way Covenant of 1662 tried to maintain church membership amid declining conversions, and the jeremiad became a genre of social critique. Modern historiography has debated whether Puritanism is best seen as a doctrinal platform or a sociological ethos. Perry Miller traced the New England mind as a grand intellectual system. Patrick Collinson called it the hotter sort of Protestant, a party within but often at odds with the English church. Nicholas Tyacke emphasized anti Arminian identity under the early Stuarts. Across these accounts, the core remains, a drive to bring every element of worship and life under the searching light of Scripture.

Puritanism began as a protest within the Settlement, grew through preaching, print, and networks, gained power in war, and remade English speaking Protestantism even after ejection, because it answered the abiding desire to match a reformed doctrine with a disciplined and godly life.
