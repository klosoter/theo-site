### ESSAY
The Reformation did not only ask what the gospel was and how a sinner is justified. It also asked who rules the church within the earthly city, and how the sword relates to the pulpit and the table. Across the sixteenth century, Protestant answers diverged sharply, sculpted by local politics and by distinct readings of Scripture and history. From Wittenberg to Zurich, from Geneva to London, and among the scattered Anabaptists, the civil magistrate was either guardian of both tables, partner of a disciplined church, supreme head of a national church, or an outsider to a separate community of saints.

Late medieval Europe had imagined a single Christian commonwealth, with pope and emperor as the two swords. By 1517 that picture had cracked. Imperial estates guarded their privileges, city councils asserted jurisdiction, and kings centralized administration. Reform, once it had shaken loose from Rome, had to be housed somewhere. The options were structurally constrained. In the Holy Roman Empire princes legislated within their lands, councils governed the cities, and imperial diets sought a tenuous equilibrium. In the kingdoms of England and France, monarchs could harness law and patronage. Against this map, theologies of magistracy took shape.

Martin Luther articulated a two kingdoms teaching early on. God rules the world in two modes, through the gospel and through the temporal sword. In Temporal Authority, 1523, he argued that the magistrate, not the clergy, bears coercive power. In emergencies, however, when bishops refused reform, princes must act as emergency bishops, providing order, schools, and visitations. The Peasants War of 1524 to 1525 hardened his view of violent revolt. In his pamphlet against the peasants in 1525 he summoned princes to restore order. The Augsburg Confession of 1530, largely penned by Philip Melanchthon, gave the public Lutheran statement. Article 16 affirmed the legitimacy of civil offices, courts, and war for defense, and it insisted that the gospel does not abolish civil order. In Electoral Saxony, ducal Saxony, and across north German lands, church orders were promulgated, and consistories staffed by jurists and theologians supervised doctrine and morals. Pastors were salaried by rulers, superintendents inspected parishes, and visitation records multiplied after 1527. The Schmalkaldic League, formed in 1531, was a union of Lutheran princes asserting their right to reform. When the Peace of Augsburg in 1555 declared cuius regio eius religio, it ratified a Lutheran settlement that placed the magistrate, whether prince or council, at the helm of a territorial church.

In Zurich, Huldrych Zwingli envisioned a Christian commonwealth where council and pulpit were integrated. The Zurich disputations of 1523 authorized reform by debate before the city council, which then legislated preaching and sacramental change. Zwingli held that the magistrate guards both tables of the law, true worship and public justice alike. The First War of Kappel in 1529 and the Second War in 1531, culminating in Zwingli's death in battle in 1531, dramatized the risks of a civic reformation. Heinrich Bullinger stabilized the Zurich model thereafter, and Bern and Basel followed similar paths, with common councils enforcing moral ordinances. Martin Bucer in Strasbourg, active from the 1520s to the 1540s, advocated a cooperative regime of discipline, drawing councils into catechesis and poor relief while urging the church to retain spiritual censure. Many historians describe these Swiss and south German models as Erastian in pattern, that is, investing the magistrate with final authority in ecclesiastical discipline and governance, even as pastors exhorted and admonished.

John Calvin's Geneva refined another balance. After an initial exile in 1538, Calvin returned in 1541 with the Ecclesiastical Ordinances. These set up a consistory of pastors and lay elders, charged with moral discipline through admonition and, in extreme cases, excommunication. The consistory did not wield the sword. It summoned and rebuked, while the councils fined or banished when needed. Calvin's Institutes reached its final Latin form in 1559, and in book four he distinguished between spiritual government and political order, yet insisted on their harmony under God. He also revived the medieval idea of lesser magistrates, subordinate officials who might lawfully resist a tyrant who attacked true religion. In the crisis of the Libertines in 1555, the councils sided with Calvin, and the consistory's authority hardened. The Genevan model traveled through refugees and print into France, Scotland, and parts of the Low Countries, where consistories became engines of lay discipline, literacy, and catechesis, even while always entangled with civic power.

England staged a different experiment. The Act of Supremacy in 1534 made Henry VIII supreme head of the Church of England. Thomas Cranmer and Parliament dissolved monasteries, issued royal injunctions, and reformed worship by statute. Under Edward VI, the Book of Common Prayer appeared in 1549 and 1552, and sermons and catechisms were authorized. After Mary's reversion to Rome, Elizabeth I established a revised supremacy in 1559, naming herself supreme governor, and a new Act of Uniformity reimposed the prayer book. The Thirty Nine Articles of 1571 declared that the civil magistrate has authority in all estates of men, yet not to minister God's word or sacraments, and Article 37 affirmed the lawfulness of the sword and of capital punishment. English bishops were royal commissioners, and the Court of High Commission enforced religious uniformity. Critics who would later be called Puritans pressed for presbyterian discipline on a Genevan pattern, yet most remained within a royal church. The English tradition leaned toward what later writers called Erastianism, with the crown and Parliament defining church polity by law.

Against these magisterial patterns stood the Anabaptists. The Schleitheim Confession of 1527, associated with Michael Sattler, demanded a gathered church of believers, a strict ban for discipline, refusal of oaths, and separation from the sword. Christians, on this view, do not hold coercive office or fight in war. The catastrophe of Munster in 1534 to 1535, where radical apocalyptic leaders seized a city and were then crushed, reinforced a pacifist trajectory among Swiss and south German Anabaptists. Menno Simons, active from the late 1530s in the Low Countries, shaped Mennonite identity around nonresistance, baptism of confession, and strict communal discipline. Anabaptists sought toleration from magistrates, but not partnership. They met persecution with migration, quietism, and internal rigor rather than with legal integration.

Persecution and civil war also stirred resistance theories among Reformed and some Lutherans after mid century. The Magdeburg Confession of 1550, drafted under Lutheran pastors during imperial siege, argued that lesser magistrates must defend true religion against a lawless superior. French Huguenots faced with the wars that erupted in 1562 elaborated covenantal resistance. The Vindiciae contra Tyrannos, 1579, argued that king and people are bound by a double covenant to God and to each other. Theodore Beza's tract on the right of magistrates in 1574 defended armed resistance under lawful leaders. These were not anarchic calls but legal arguments bequeathing a structured path to resist persecution.

Several turning points mark the arc. The Peasants War disciplined early evangelical hope and drove Luther to embrace princely order. Augsburg in 1530 linked doctrine and public law. The death of Zwingli and the Bernese triumph in 1531 confirmed the city council's supremacy in Swiss reform. Geneva's ordinances in 1541 and the Libertine crisis in 1555 fixed the consistory as a disciplined lay clerical court. The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 normalized territorial churches in the Empire. The English settlement of 1559 shaped a durable royal church. The Huguenot treatises of the 1570s gave Protestantism a theory of lawful resistance in confessionalized Europe.

Theologically, these arrangements reconfigured the medieval corpus christianum. Luther's two kingdoms restrained clerical power and sacral monarchy alike, legitimating vocation, law, and the crafts under God while granting princes emergency oversight of the church. Zwingli's Christian commonwealth baptized civic humanism into pastoral governance, with councils enacting Scripture in statutes. Calvin's consistory distinguished spiritual censure from civil coercion, creating a disciplined public that internalized morality. The English royal supremacy translated ecclesiology into statute, crafting a legal church. Anabaptist separation reasserted the congregational conscience over the claims of the state and pioneered the logic of religious liberty. Resistance theory introduced covenant and contract into politics, opening channels for later constitutionalism.

Reception and legacy varied. Lutheran and Reformed lands in the Empire and Scandinavia evolved robust state churches, with consistories guiding education and morals. The Genevan pattern seeded presbyterian polities in France, the Netherlands, and Scotland, though always entangled with magistrates. England's church remained legally national yet spawned nonconformist movements that drew on Reformed and Anabaptist ideals. Free church traditions, Mennonite and later Baptist, carried the Anabaptist posture of separation into the Atlantic world. Across these lines, the civil magistrate was never simply a neutral umpire. Depending on the confession, he was pastor by proxy, guardian of both tables, royal governor of a national church, or a neighbor to be respected yet not obeyed in matters of conscience. That complex map defined early modern Europe and set patterns still recognizably at work in later centuries.
