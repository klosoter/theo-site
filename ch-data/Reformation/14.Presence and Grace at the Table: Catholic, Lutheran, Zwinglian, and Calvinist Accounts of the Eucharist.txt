### ESSAY
When the Reformation asked what God promises and gives in the gospel, the question narrowed with heat around two words from the Supper narratives, This is. Medieval Latin Christianity had already honed a precise answer. The Reformation pressed the edge, pushing language, ritual, and hope into new patterns. Four trajectories emerged with lasting profiles: Catholic, Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist. Each answered two intertwined questions. How is Christ present. What grace is communicated to those who eat and drink.

The late medieval stage matters. By the thirteenth century, scholastic theology had stabilized a metaphysical grammar. Fourth Lateran Council 1215 declared that by the power of God the bread and wine are converted into the body and blood of Christ. Thomas Aquinas, writing in the 1260s, applied Aristotelian substance and accidents to speak of transubstantiation, a conversion of substance under the enduring species. Public devotion grew. The feast of Corpus Christi spread after 1264. Elevation of the host, processions, and adoration reinforced a sense of Christ localized on the altar. Grace followed the action of the sacrament. Ex opere operato named the divine reliability, independent of the ministers moral state, but tied to right form and matter and requiring worthy reception.

Against that backdrop, Luther moved not to abolish a real presence, but to secure it on evangelical grounds. In The Babylonian Captivity of the Church 1520 he denounced the Mass as sacrifice and defended communion in both kinds, yet insisted on the promise attached to the words of institution. He sharpened his case in Confession Concerning Christs Supper 1528 and Against the Heavenly Prophets 1525, where he resisted symbolic and spiritualizing readings. The rite is Christ giving his body and blood to be eaten and drunk. The manner is a sacramental union. The bread remains bread, the wine remains wine, yet the whole Christ is really present in, with, and under the elements by promise. Luther rejected metaphysical conversion vocabulary, not because it was too bold, but because it obscured the clarity of the words. The communicant, whether believer or unbeliever, receives the body and blood orally. This is the manducatio oralis and the manducatio impiorum. The reprobate receives to judgment. The believer receives forgiveness of sins, the pledge of the gospel, and a strengthening of faith. The confessional codification appears in Article 10 of the Augsburg Confession 1530 and is further sharpened in the Formula of Concord 1577, which supports the ubiquity of Christs glorified body as a christological underpinning and firmly denies that the Supper is mere memorial.

Across the Swiss lands, Huldrych Zwingli in Zurich took a different route. Early disputations in 1523 moved the city to reform by Scripture. By 1525 Zurich celebrated a simplified Supper. Zwinglis writings, such as On the Lord's Supper 1525 and the Friendly Exegesis 1527, interpreted the dominical words tropically. This is my body means, this signifies my body. Christ is present by his divinity and by the Spirit, but his body, truly human and finite, is at the right hand of the Father. The signs, bread and wine, seal the promises of God and focus the community in remembrance and thanksgiving. The grace communicated is not a physical or localized communication but the strengthening of faith through obedient remembrance, the renewal of covenant loyalty, and the knitting of the body of believers in charity. Zwingli insists that the chief instrument of grace is the preached Word. The sacrament seals what the Word declares. For Zwingli, to place the body in the bread is to confuse natures and to compromise the ascended mode of Christs humanity.

The Swiss Lutheran clash became public at the Marburg Colloquy in 1529, called by Philip of Hesse to unify reformers. Luther chalked the words This is my body on the table and refused Zwinglis tropes. They agreed on fourteen articles and parted on the fifteenth, presence. The issue was not devotional temperature. It was metaphysics, Christology, and hermeneutics. The result was durable division.

John Calvin, a generation younger, took a middle path in Geneva after 1536. In the Institutes, first published 1536 and definitively revised 1559, and in the Short Treatise on the Supper of our Lord 1541, Calvin rejected both the localizing implication of transubstantiation and the bare memorialism he found in Zurich. For Calvin, the Supper offers nothing less than true communion with the whole Christ. The Spirit unites believers to the ascended Lord. There is a real spiritual presence, not imaginary. By the secret virtue of the Spirit, believers are lifted to heaven, where they feed on the life giving flesh and drink the blood. The elements are instruments used by God to communicate the reality signified. The presence is real and objective in the act of God, yet it is received only by faith. Calvin denies the manducatio impiorum, saying that the wicked receive the sacrament but not Christ himself. The grace given includes forgiveness, renewal, and an increase of union with Christ, the res that the sacrament signs and seals. Calvin reads the words, this is my body, as sacramental speech. He accepts that Scripture often uses is to denote sacramental signification. Yet he insists the sign is wedded to the thing signified by divine promise and Spirit.

The Catholic Church responded at Trent. Session 13 in 1551 affirmed transubstantiation and the enduring presence of the whole Christ under each species, and articulated adoration as fitting. It rejected empty symbolic interpretations and insisted on the sacrificial dimension as re presentation in Session 22 in 1562. Grace flows ex opere operato to the rightly disposed, increasing charity and remitting venial sins, and the sacrament binds communicants into ecclesial unity. The priesthood and the altar context remain integral. The metaphysical grammar of substance and accidents is retained, not as rationalist capture, but as bulwark for the mystery of the words.

Within Lutheranism, the Wittenberg Concord 1536 found common ground with South German reformers, but boundaries with the Reformed sharpened later. The Formula of Concord 1577 drew together the strands. It defended the sacramental union and the oral eating of the body by all who eat and drink. It invoked the communication of attributes to explain how the human nature of Christ shares in divine majesty after the ascension. This undergirds the ubiquity of Christs body, making a local or bodily presence at the Supper possible without fragmentation.

Among the Reformed, Zurich and Geneva gradually moved closer after 1549. The Consensus Tigurinus 1549, agreed by Calvin and Heinrich Bullinger, replaced Zwinglis sharper memorial language with a strong account of Spirit mediated communion, while maintaining that Christs body remains in heaven. It avoided the charge of local presence and refused the manducatio impiorum. The Reformed stream thus carries both Zurich caution and Genevan confidence in a real, though pneumatic, communion.

What do these trajectories yield in theological profile. The Catholic account anchors presence in a metaphysical conversion, securing objectivity and continuity with medieval devotion. Grace is communicated by the sacrament as instituted by Christ, conferring benefits ex opere operato to those not impeded by mortal sin. The Lutheran account secures presence by divine promise and christological ubiquity, with sacramental union rather than conversion. Grace is forgiveness and assurance given through oral reception, faith grasping the promise while even the unworthy receive Christ to their harm. The Zwinglian account secures the honor of the ascended humanity and the primacy of the Word, with the Supper as sign and oath that stirs memory and fidelity. Grace is a covenantal strengthening through remembrance and communal discipline. The Calvinist account secures real communion without local presence, by the agency of the Spirit who lifts the faithful to partake of Christ in heaven. Grace is union with Christ renewed and deepened, with faith as the only mouth that eats.

Reception set boundaries. The eucharist became a badge of confession as much as a means of grace. Political orders tied peace to table practice. Cities like Zurich legislated simple tables. Lutheran territories guarded the elevation. Catholic lands heightened processions and adoration in the wake of Trent. The divisions carved liturgies, crafted pieties, and shaped theology. Yet all four held that Christ truly gives himself to his church in the Supper, even as they contended over how that gift is present and how its grace is communicated.

The Reformation therefore bequeathed not one answer but a field of disciplined answers, each tightening different threads of Scripture and doctrine to hold together presence and grace at the table.
