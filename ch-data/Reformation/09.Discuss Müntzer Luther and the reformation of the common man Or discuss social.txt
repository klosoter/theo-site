### ESSAY
A single question presses at the heart of the early Reformation. What would renewal of the gospel mean for the common man, the people who tilled fields, paid tithes, and listened in parish naves to sermons they could now hear in their own tongue. Two voices disputed the answer in the 1520s. Martin Luther sought to reorder faith and life through preaching, catechesis, and councils. Thomas Muntzer claimed the Spirit demanded purgation of the ungodly and the elevation of the godly poor. Their encounter does not read only as a clash of temperaments. It set the terms for what popular reform could be.

The background was a late medieval social landscape strained by dues, rents, and lordly jurisdiction, and by resentment at clerical exactions. Humanist pedagogy, vernacular preaching, and the press, active since the 1450s, endowed towns and villages with new capacities. Piety had long since moved beyond monasteries into confraternities and lay devotion. By 1517 Luther's Ninety Five Theses at Wittenberg named indulgence traffic as a pastoral fraud. His program matured in the trio of 1520 treatises. To the Christian Nobility called for magistrates to reform abuses. On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church curbed sacramental power. The Freedom of a Christian argued that faith frees the conscience before God and sends the believer back into works of neighbor love. These texts, together with the September Testament of 1522, Luther's German New Testament, let the layman read and hear scripture for himself.

Thomas Muntzer moved along a different arc. Born in the 1490s in Stolberg, he stepped beyond Wittenberg's evangelicalism through intensified apocalyptic expectation and a theology of the inner word. Around 1521 he drafted the Prague Manifesto, a fierce call for a purified church made of the elect. In Allstedt in 1523 he crafted a German liturgy and catechetical preaching that attacked idols, not only images, but also unjust powers. In July 1524 he preached the Sermon to the Princes at the Allstedt castle, warning Duke John of Saxony that God would raise a Daniel to shatter the statue of tyranny. Muntzer taught that the true believer must pass through a searing experience of divine judgment, becoming a vessel for the Spirit's work. He read scripture through the lens of Revelation and Daniel, with the poor as the instrument of God's final act.

Even before open revolt, common people were translating the theological debate into social claims. The Twelve Articles of the Upper Swabian peasants, first circulated in March 1525, demanded the right to choose pastors, relief from excessive tithes, restoration of communal rights in woods and waters, and a justice measured by the gospel. The Articles cited the word of God as their ground. The resonance with Luther's insistence on freedom of conscience is evident. Yet Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms, set forth in Temporal Authority in 1523, held that God governs spiritually by the word and materially by magistrates. He would not have the gospel dissolve order.

As revolt spread from the Black Forest and Allgau to Thuringia, differences hardened. Muntzer left Allstedt for Muehlhausen, where he and Heinrich Pfeiffer urged a godly community, dissolved monastic properties, and rallied rural bands under banners inscribed with the rainbow of the covenant. In May 1525 he marched with peasants near Frankenhausen. Luther, alarmed by reports of sacked cloisters and violent levelling, issued Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants in early May 1525. The pamphlet is a grim text. He called on princes to cut down the rebels as one must kill a mad dog. The defeat at Frankenhausen on 15 May sealed the revolt. Muntzer was captured, interrogated, and executed on 27 May 1525. The carnage across Swabia, Franconia, and Thuringia broke peasant resistance and branded apocalyptic social reform as a deadly temptation.

The turning of 1525 did not end the question of the common man. Instead it redirected reform toward institutions that would nurture congregations and restrain poverty. Already in 1523 local leaders in Leisnig created a common chest, pooling tithes and gifts to support the poor, pastors, and schools. Luther wrote an approving preface and defended the ordinance as a practical outworking of neighbor love. In 1524 he issued Admonition to the Councilmen of All Cities in Germany that They Establish and Maintain Christian Schools. He argued that princes and magistrates must found schools for boys and girls, so that the word of God would take root and civic competence would grow. In Zurich, Ulrich Zwingli spearheaded a new poor law in 1525, centralizing alms in a common fund and ending mendicancy. Strasbourg under Martin Bucer and Wolfgang Capito restructured parish ministry and poor relief through church orders in the mid 1520s. Wittenberg's team codified pastoral oversight in the Visitation Articles of 1528, linking catechesis, schoolmasters, and liturgical reforms to the oversight of the Elector.

Behind these moves stood Luther's conviction about vocation. The shoemaker and the mother, the magistrate and the schoolmaster, all serve God in their callings. Justification by faith levels the standing of lay and cleric before God, yet it also sends the justified back into the tasks of station for the sake of the neighbor. This theological grammar proved powerful in city councils eager to harness reform for ordered charity. It also set limits. Lay empowerment occurred through councils and consistories, through catechisms and vernacular preaching, rather than through charismatic upheaval.

Muntzer's theology, by contrast, interpreted the moment through the biblical drama of judgment. He expected the Spirit to grant discernment to the poor, to unmask the ungodly, and to inaugurate a purified church. His German liturgies and his vernacular preaching show pastoral concern. Yet his sharp separation of the elect and the reprobate, and his readiness to invoke coercion in the Spirit's name, left little room for a shared civic space. After 1525, his example became a foil in Lutheran and Reformed polemic, a warning of the tyranny of the enthusiasts.

The legacies diverged but remained intertwined. In Lutheran lands the 1520s and 1530s saw an expansion of Latin schools, German song schools, and poor relief chests under civic oversight. Luther's Small and Large Catechisms in 1529 tightened the link between home, parish, and school. Ordinary Christians learned the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer, embedding evangelical doctrine in daily speech. The Reformed cities traveled similar roads, though with distinctive emphases on discipline and diaconal boards. Radical currents survived too. Swiss Anabaptists in 1525 broke with Zwingli over baptism and the use of force, and in the Schleitheim Articles of 1527 affirmed a gathered church, separation from the sword, and ethical rigor. Their vision drew in part on the same desire to realize a church of the committed that animated Muntzer, though they renounced his violence.

Historians have long debated the meaning of 1525. Nineteenth century writers such as Friedrich Engels read Muntzer as a proto revolutionary whose defeat marked a bourgeois betrayal. Recent scholarship is more careful. It situates Muntzer in mystical and apocalyptic currents and weighs his pastoral creativity alongside his politics. It also credits Luther and civic reformers with inventing a Protestant social state in miniature, one that married preaching and schooling to poor relief and moral policing. In that framework, the common man gained access to scripture and education, relief in time of need, and a voice through councils, yet lost the language of insurrection.

The early Reformation was thus a contested reformation of the people. It moved from pulpit and press into farms and councils, and it struggled to decide whether the Spirit's fire would refine or incinerate. Luther's way, anchored in justification, vocation, and ordered charity, carried the day. Muntzer's way, fierce and apocalyptic, left a trace that warned and provoked in equal measure. The common man emerged literate, catechized, and better served by civic institutions, but bounded by magistrates who learned to claim the work of reform as their own.
