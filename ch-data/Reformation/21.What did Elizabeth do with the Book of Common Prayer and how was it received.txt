### ESSAY
When Elizabeth Tudor came to the throne in November 1558 she inherited a kingdom that had swung from the conservative vernacular reforms of 1549 to the sharper Protestantism of 1552, then back to Latin Mass and papal obedience under Mary. The question she faced in 1559 was not only what prayer book to use, but how to make a liturgy that could hold a fractured realm together. Her answer was the Elizabethan Prayer Book, a carefully edited version of the Edwardian rites, backed by statute and discipline, and designed to be heard every Sunday at every parish altar table in England.

Context first. The Book of Common Prayer had appeared under Edward VI in two main editions, 1549 and 1552. The first retained much ceremony and a Catholic sounding formula at Communion. The second tightened reformed doctrine and stripped away ambiguity, adding the Black Rubric to deny any corporal presence in kneeling. Mary I swept all this aside in 1553 and restored Latin rites until her death in 1558. Elizabeth and her ministers moved swiftly in 1559. Two acts defined the settlement. The Act of Supremacy restored the crown to headship over the church, now styled supreme governor. The Act of Uniformity mandated a new Book of Common Prayer and attendance at parish worship on Sundays and holy days on pain of fines.

What did Elizabeth do to the book itself. She did not write a new liturgy from scratch. Instead, the 1559 book was essentially the 1552 text, but with targeted alterations meant to widen the circle of conformity. Most notable was the formula at the distribution of Communion. The 1552 words, Take and eat this in remembrance, were retained but immediately preceded by the more objective 1549 words, The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life. In practice the minister spoke the combined sentence, which allowed a hearer to stress either remembrance through faith or the gift given. The Black Rubric, which in 1552 had declared that kneeling implied no adoration of any corporal presence, was dropped in 1559, again removing a sharp edge. A new Ornaments Rubric directed that ornaments of the church and of the ministers be those in use by authority of Parliament in the second year of Edward VI. That obscure reference, 1548 to 1549, seemed to authorize at least the surplice for parish clergy and the cope in cathedrals, and it placed a conservative brake on radical simplification.

Other changes signaled moderation without surrendering reformed substance. The calendar retained the principal feasts and many saints days, though pared down. The litany continued to pray for the queen and realm instead of the pope. The lectionary set the nation to hear Scripture read straight through at Morning and Evening Prayer. The Royal Injunctions of 1559, issued under the supremacy, spelled out practice. Communion tables were to be placed in the chancel, not as fixed stone altars. Images were to be removed where they had been abused. Music was permitted in a modest form. Clergy were to wear the surplice in parish services. All of this placed the 1559 book within a recognizably Protestant framework while preserving enough ceremonial texture to reassure conservative parishioners.

How was it received. The queen and her advisers aimed less at doctrinal precision than at obedience and habit. Parish life is the measure here. In thousands of churches, churchwardens bought the new book, set up the table, and saw that Morning and Evening Prayer were said and that Communion was celebrated on the appointed feasts. Many laity welcomed English services they could follow, baptisms and marriages they could understand, and sermons that opened the Bible. Compliance, broadly defined, was widespread, and the fines for nonattendance were initially light. A large group of so called church papists were content to attend outwardly while maintaining Catholic loyalties at home.

Two groups were dissatisfied for opposite reasons. Committed Roman Catholics wanted the Mass and papal authority restored. Their resistance hardened after two shocks. The Northern Rebellion of 1569 tried to restore Catholic worship and failed. In 1570 Pope Pius V issued Regnans in Excelsis, excommunicating Elizabeth and releasing subjects from obedience. After that, recusancy became a political crime as well as a religious one. The government increased fines in 1581 and hunted missionary priests sent from Douai and Rome in the late 1570s. Reception among Catholics thus moved from grudging conformity to pockets of principled recusancy, especially in the north and northwest, while the parish system continued to function with the Prayer Book as its script.

On the other flank stood the Puritans, who accepted the reformed doctrine of the Thirty Nine Articles drafted in 1563 and authorized in 1571 but pressed for a further stripping of ceremonies. They objected to set forms of prayer, to the sign of the cross in baptism, to kneeling at Communion, to godparents and the wedding ring, and to vestments. The Vestiarian Controversy in 1565 to 1566 pitted nonconforming ministers like Thomas Sampson and Laurence Humphrey against Archbishop Matthew Parker, who issued Advertisements in 1566 requiring the surplice and enforcing use of the book. John Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, defended the settlement in his Apology for the Church of England in 1562, arguing that the rites were lawful and edifying. Still the agitation continued. The Admonition to the Parliament in 1572 by John Field and Thomas Wilcox denounced the Prayer Book as unscriptural and called for presbyterian polity and extempore prayer. Archbishop John Whitgift, who took office in 1583, answered with a hard line, demanding subscription to the Articles and the Prayer Book, and using the High Commission to curb evangelicals who would not conform. Radical separatists like Henry Barrow and John Greenwood suffered imprisonment and execution in 1593. In this climate many ministers and lay people conformed outwardly, preached diligently, and used the Prayer Book while hoping for future reform.

Beyond England the picture varied. In Wales, William Salesbury and Bishop Richard Davies oversaw a translation of the Prayer Book into Welsh in 1567 alongside a Welsh New Testament, a sign of integration. In Ireland, the English book was mandated but, because it was in English and lacked a secure Irish speaking clergy, it failed to take deep root. That mixed reception underscores the political character of uniformity and the need for vernacular traction.

Theologically the 1559 revision staged a measured ambiguity. The combined Communion formula allowed a reformed reading of spiritual feeding by faith and a more objective gift language that resonated with older piety. The omission of the Black Rubric lowered polemical temperature without endorsing presence in a crude way. The Ornaments Rubric and vesture rules signaled that ceremonies could be treated as adiaphora, churchly matters indifferent that could be ordered for good order and edification. In tandem, the Thirty Nine Articles defined doctrinal lines, rejecting transubstantiation in Article 28 and affirming two sacraments of the Gospel in Article 25, thus ensuring that ceremonial moderation did not blur the confessional profile.

By the 1580s the book had settled into habit. Parishioners learned its cadences, godparents recited the Creed and Lord's Prayer, and the burial service shaped a language of hope. At the same time, the settlement was never static. Enforcement tightened after 1570. Puritan energy produced prophesyings and lectureships, which Archbishop Edmund Grindal hesitated to suppress in 1577 and for which he suffered royal displeasure. Whitgift later insisted on conformity. Yet the Prayer Book endured because it could do the everyday work of prayer and Scripture, and because the crown made it the law of the land.

In sum, Elizabeth restored the English liturgy in 1559 by reissuing the 1552 Book of Common Prayer with conciliatory edits, binding it with law, and policing its use. Her subjects received it in layers. The majority conformed, some with conviction, some out of habit. Catholic recusants endured and were pressed hard after 1570. Puritans grumbled, argued, and sometimes broke ranks, yet most stayed. Out of that contested reception emerged a common prayer that would be revised in 1604 under James and standardized in 1662, carrying Elizabeth's pragmatic settlement into the heart of Anglican worship and identity.
