### ESSAY
When Martin Luther posted academic theses against indulgences in 1517, he touched a nerve already inflamed by pastoral confusion and institutional strain. The immediate quarrel was over the treasury of merits and papal indulgences, but beneath it lay urgent questions about how a sinner is made right with God, how the church speaks with authority, and how ordinary Christians are taught and cared for. Luther's Reformation was both practical and theological. Its energy came from his conviction that doctrine is for the pulpit and the conscience, and that church structures and rites must serve the gospel, not obscure it.

The late medieval setting framed the concerns that erupted. The Western Schism had ended in 1417, yet the prestige of papal governance remained contested. Preaching was often sparse, confession could be formalistic, and the penitential system had grown into a complex economy of satisfactions and indulgences. Humanist scholars pressed ad fontes, to the sources, producing new biblical and patristic editions. In Saxony, the Elector Frederick safeguarded Wittenberg University as a center for both scholastic and humanist inquiry. Luther, an Augustinian friar born in 1483 and professor of biblical studies from 1512, met the Psalms and Romans not as abstractions but as the Word that judges and consoles.

His foremost theological concern was the righteousness of God and the assurance of salvation. Through his reading of Romans 1 and Galatians around 1515 to 1519, Luther came to teach that the righteousness by which the sinner lives is not an infused habit but an alien righteousness, Christ's own, imputed by faith. The sinner is simul iustus et peccator, righteous and sinner at once. Justification by faith alone answered a practical pastoral crisis. If absolution hinges on the quality or quantity of human contrition and satisfactions, then consciences oscillate between presumption and despair. If, however, God declares the ungodly righteous for Christ's sake, then the believer has a firm word to stand on. Luther's law and gospel distinction sharpened this point. The law exposes sin and strips the sinner of self trust. The gospel announces what God has done and gives what it promises through Word and sacrament.

His second chief concern was authority. At Leipzig in 1519, debating Johann Eck, Luther admitted that popes and councils can err, citing Jan Hus and the Council of Constance. Thus the formal norm must be Scripture, the prophetic and apostolic writings that alone bind conscience. Sola scriptura did not mean isolated individualism. It entailed a hermeneutic in which Christ is the center, and the church hears the text proclaimed in preaching and enacted in the sacraments. Yet it cut against claims that papal decretals, canon law, or scholastic consensus could define doctrine independent of Scripture.

These convictions drove the 1520 treatises that converted protest into program. In Address to the Christian Nobility, Luther knocked down the three walls of medieval clerical privilege, arguing for the spiritual estate of all baptized and the responsibility of princes to reform abuses. In The Babylonian Captivity of the Church, he reduced the sacraments to those instituted by Christ with a promise attached, namely Baptism and the Eucharist, and he rejected the sacrificial logic of the mass. In The Freedom of a Christian, he held together the liberty of faith and the bondage of love, the believer free lord of all and the diligent servant of all. These were not merely polemics. They reoriented pastoral practice. Confession and absolution were retained as a consolation, not as a commerce. The mass was made a gift to be received, not a work offered for the living and the dead. Monastic vows lost their binding force where taken as means of justification, and clerical marriage was affirmed as honorable.

The crisis of 1521 to 1522 hardened the lines. Summoned to the Diet of Worms before Emperor Charles V, Luther refused to recant unless convinced by Scripture and clear reason. Hidden in the Wartburg after his condemnation, he translated the New Testament into German in 1522, and completed a full Bible by 1534. That translation, along with hymnody and catechisms, met a practical priority. People needed the Word in their tongue, robust preaching, and catechetical formation. Luther's Invocavit Sermons of 1522, preached upon his return to Wittenberg, show his pastoral caution. He checked Karlstadt's iconoclasm and the rush to sweeping change. Faith must be persuaded by the Word, not compelled by force or disorder.

Institutionally, Luther focused on the marks of the church, the pure preaching of the gospel and the right administration of the sacraments. That gave rise to visitations in Saxony in 1528, with articles assessing preaching, catechesis, and moral discipline. The Small and Large Catechisms of 1529 provided tools for households, pastors, and schools, teaching the Ten Commandments, Creed, Lord's Prayer, and the sacraments with vivid simplicity. Liturgy was reformed through the Formula Missae of 1523 and the Deutsche Messe of 1526, with vernacular elements, congregational singing, and a restored emphasis on the Words of Institution. These changes were pastoral in aim. They reeducated laity and clergy in the grammar of grace.

A third major concern was the Supper. Against Zwingli and the Swiss, Luther insisted on the real presence of Christ's body and blood, given for the forgiveness of sins. At Marburg in 1529, he wrote This is my body on the table to underscore the verba. He denied transubstantiation as a scholastic theory, yet taught sacramental union, that Christ's body is truly given with the bread. The Supper is not a bare memorial but a testament that delivers what it promises. This insistence flowed from his doctrine of the Word as effective speech and his view of faith as trust in promise, not bare assent.

The Reformation also grappled with the will. Erasmus of Rotterdam published On Free Will in 1524, preferring a cautious human synergy in salvation. Luther answered with The Bondage of the Will in 1525. There he identified the hinge of the cause. Human will is bound in sin and cannot cooperate toward justification. Salvation is by grace alone, lest confidence slip back into self, and pastoral assurance be lost. That exchange crystallized the theological stakes and tied them to pastoral ends.

Politics intervened, and Luther's two kingdoms doctrine attempted to clarify roles. In On Secular Authority in 1523, he distinguished the realm of the gospel, where God rules by Word and faith, and the realm of temporal order, where God curbs wickedness by law and the sword. He counseled obedience to magistrates yet set limits where rulers commanded sin. The Peasants War of 1524 to 1525 exposed the dangers. Luther rebuked both lords and peasants and, after violence erupted, he backed firm suppression. His response, harsh in tone, flowed from a concern to prevent anarchy and to keep gospel reform from being swallowed by social revolution.

The Augsburg Confession in 1530, drafted by Melanchthon, presented evangelical teaching to the empire. It confessed justification by faith, the centrality of preaching and sacraments, and a moderated order of bishops where possible. Its Apology in 1531 elaborated the doctrine of justification as the article by which the church stands or falls. Later, the Schmalkaldic Articles of 1537 declared the papacy to be antichrist when it bound consciences apart from the gospel, and they summarized Luther's mature judgments. On the other side, the Council of Trent, opening in 1545, affirmed a cooperative view of justification and the sacramental system, condemned Lutheran positions, and launched a disciplined Catholic reform.

The reception of Luther's concerns shaped Europe. In German lands, territorial churches developed with consistories overseeing doctrine and discipline. Education expanded, with schools and universities oriented toward catechesis and languages. The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 established the principle that the religion of the ruler would be the religion of the territory, a political solution that did not resolve theological divides. The Book of Concord in 1580 later gathered Lutheran confessions, cementing the priorities of justification, Word and sacrament, and pastoral care.

In sum, Luther's Reformation yoked doctrine to conscience and worship. Its chief practical concerns were assurance, preaching, catechesis, liturgy, and church order. Its chief theological concerns were the righteousness of faith, the authority of Scripture, the saving efficacy of Word and sacrament, the real presence in the Supper, and the bondage of the will. That combination produced a churchly reform that spoke to ordinary Christians and confronted the powers of its age, leaving a legacy still contested and still alive.
