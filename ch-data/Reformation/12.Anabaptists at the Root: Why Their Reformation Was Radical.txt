### ESSAY
To call the Anabaptist movement a radical reformation is to make a claim with two edges. Radical can mean a plunge to the extremes, and it can mean a return to the roots. Both meanings are at stake here. I agree that Anabaptism was a radical reformation, but it was radical first in its rootward vision of the church and only sometimes in social extremity. To see this clearly, we must place the Swiss Brethren, the South German and Austrian circles, and the Dutch and North German streams within the tumult of the 1520s and 1530s and judge their aims against both medieval Christendom and the Magisterial Reformers.

The immediate setting was Zurich under Huldrych Zwingli, with disputations in 1523 and 1524 aiming to reform preaching, images, and worship according to Scripture. The problem arose when the city council claimed the pace and boundaries of reform, while students and colleagues of Zwingli pressed the logic of sola scriptura into the shape of a visible, disciplined congregation of believers. In January 1525, after months of debate on baptism, Conrad Grebel, Felix Manz, and George Blaurock baptized one another, marking the birth of the Swiss Brethren. The city then outlawed rebaptism and soon turned to imprisonment and drowning. Manz was executed by drowning in January 1527, a grim sign of how civic and imperial order would treat voluntary churchhood.

Across South Germany and Austria the same ferment produced distinct voices. Balthasar Hubmaier, active in Waldshut and then in Nikolsburg, argued for believers baptism in works of 1525 and 1526, yet he probed the sword question differently, allowing a magistrate to bear arms while the church stayed pure. Michael Sattler, a former monk, helped convene a gathering in 1527 that produced the Schleitheim Confession. Its seven articles drew a sharp line around the believing community: baptism on confession of faith, the Ban as communal discipline, the Supper as memorial among the faithful, separation from the world, pastoral shepherding, rejection of the sword for Christians, and refusal of oaths. Sattler was executed at Rottenburg in May 1527. Pilgram Marpeck, an engineer and pastor, wrote pastoral treatises in the 1540s that sought a charitable but rigorous ecclesial path, resisting both revolutionary violence and antinomian inwardness.

In the Low Countries a different arc unfolded. Melchior Hoffman preached an imminent judgment in the late 1520s, sparking apocalyptic expectation. In 1534 and 1535, Jan Matthys and Jan van Leiden seized Munster, abolished infant baptism, and attempted a theocratic New Jerusalem, imposing polygamy and violent coercion. The siege and fall of Munster in June 1535 resulted in brutal suppression and long shadows over all Anabaptists. Out of that crisis, Menno Simons, a former priest born in 1496, emerged as a patient organizer. In his Foundation of Christian Doctrine, 1539, and in pastoral letters, he articulated a pacifist, disciplined, and evangelizing network that would eventually bear his name, Mennonites.

Was this radical reformation? In ecclesiology, the answer is an unambiguous yes. The Anabaptists redefined the church as a voluntary, visible fellowship of regenerate believers bound by covenant, subject to mutual admonition, and marked by a serious practice of the Ban. That vision repudiated the territorial parish that had structured Latin Christendom and also undercut the Magisterial settlement, which relied upon city councils and princes to shepherd territorial churches. The Anabaptists were not content with mere moral exhortation from above. They relocated authority in the gathered body under Scripture, preached in the vernacular, and expected discipleship to be measurable in obedience. The Schleitheim program is the clearest early synthesis of this turn, and it is radical because it sought to uproot the institutional premises of a millennium of Christendom.

In soteriology and Christology, however, most Anabaptists were not innovating beyond the catholic and Reformation mainstream. They confessed the Trinity, the incarnation, and salvation by grace through faith. Their emphasis fell on following Christ, Gelassenheit or yieldedness, and the imitation of the Sermon on the Mount. This was not Pelagian moralism but a sanctified life empowered by the Spirit within a disciplined community. The notable exception is the Melchiorite apocalyptic strand that burst into revolutionary action at Munster, which most other Anabaptists condemned. Menno Simons spent the 1540s and 1550s distinguishing his flock from the violence and licentiousness associated with Munster.

Their political theology sharpened the charge of radicalism. The oath was refused on the grounds of the words of Jesus in Matthew 5. The sword was rejected for Christians not because the magistrate had no role in restraining evil, but because the disciple must not kill. Separation from the world did not mean withdrawal from work or family, but it demanded a clear boundary with the honor culture and coercive instruments of the age. The Hutterites added a communal economy, settled in Moravia from 1528, shaped under Jakob Hutter, who was executed in 1536. Their Bruderhofs practiced common ownership as an expression of Acts 2 and 4, embedding discipleship into daily labor and mutual care. This too was radical, though not anarchic. It was a constructive social order built without the sword.

The turning points are stark. In 1525 a new initiation rite redrew the map of belonging. In 1527 Schleitheim gave a handbook for congregational life. In 1529 the Diet of Speyer criminalized rebaptism with the penalty of death, making martyrdom a fixture of the movement. In 1534 and 1535 the catastrophe at Munster provided governments a pretext for sweeping repression. In the 1540s Menno Simons stabilized the Dutch and North German networks through house churches, itinerant elders, and a printed catechetical program. Through these decades the Anabaptists paid in blood for their refusal to fold their congregations back into the territorial system. The Martyrs Mirror, compiled in 1660 by Thieleman van Braght, later wove these stories into a communal memory, reinforcing a spiritual posture of suffering rather than conquest.

How should we weigh the label radical in light of all this? If we mean extreme or violent, then only the Munster episode fits, and it stands as a deviation repudiated by the main streams. If we mean a reformation that strikes at the roots of the inherited synthesis of church and empire, then Anabaptism is radical in essence. It challenged the old alignment of sacraments, citizenship, and coercion, and it viewed the New Testament, especially the teaching of Jesus, as a binding charter for social life in the church. Compared to Luther, who in 1525 admonished the peasants and maintained princely oversight, and compared to Zwingli, who trusted the council to steward reform, the Anabaptists relocated power downward into gathered congregations and limited the magistrate to the civil sphere.

The reception was ferocious because their ecclesiology was politically destabilizing. To refuse oaths and military service was to unmask the fragile blend of faith and civic loyalty without offering the magistrate a clear substitute. Their enemies called them seditious. Their own leaders called them pilgrims. Over time, confessionalization in the empire hardened boundaries. By the later sixteenth century, Mennonites and Hutterites negotiated tolerated niches, often under conditions of exile. In the seventeenth century, Mennonites found refuge in the Dutch Republic and Prussia, Hutterites eventually migrated eastward, and in the eighteenth century, many crossed the Atlantic. The Amish, named after Jakob Ammann in 1693, extended the Anabaptist instinct for discipline into a stricter form of separation.

Historians have debated the unity and scope of the Radical Reformation. George Williams popularized the typology in the twentieth century, distinguishing Anabaptists from spiritualists and evangelicals. Later scholars, such as James Stayer and Hans Jurgan Goertz, cautioned against flattening the diversity, noting the range from communal Hutterites to artisan house churches to spiritualist prophets. Yet the Anabaptist core remains clear, centered on believers baptism, a disciplined community, and a nonviolent ethic, all defended with a literal and communal reading of Scripture.

Therefore, I agree that the Anabaptist movement represents a radical reformation, radical because it sought to recover the apostolic root of the church as a free, disciplined, and suffering body under the lordship of Christ, and radical not because it loved extremity but because it altered the foundations of Western Christian public life.
