### ESSAY
The doctrine of justification stood at the heart of the early Reformation because it posed a direct pastoral and theological question. How can the ungodly be righteous before a holy God. In the late medieval church, that question was answered within a sacramental, penitential economy. Grace infused virtue, the sinner cooperated, satisfactions were rendered, and, at the margins, indulgences promised relief. Luther's answer, forged in teaching Scripture and in the furnace of spiritual trial, relocated righteousness from within the sinner to the outside work of Christ, and it located certainty not in a process but in a divine verdict announced in the Gospel.

The background is essential. Medieval scholasticism had interpreted justification as the making righteous. Thomas Aquinas described a habit of grace, infused by God, which healed nature and ordered love. The via moderna, associated with William of Ockham and Gabriel Biel, qualified this with a covenant principle, God accepts the one who does what lies within, facientibus quod in se est, God gives grace. The sacrament of penance turned on contrition, confession, absolution, and satisfaction. A scale of mortal and venial sin, a treasury of merit, and indulgences accompanied this economy. Luther, born 1483, entered the Augustinian order in 1505. Under Johann von Staupitz he learned to read Scripture and to seek Christ. Yet he also experienced deep Anfechtungen, a battering of conscience that found no rest in works or in the ladder of charity.

From 1513 to 1518 Luther lectured on the Psalms, then Romans, then Galatians and Hebrews in Wittenberg. Wrestling with Romans 1, especially the phrase righteousness of God, he found a breakthrough he later narrated in his 1545 Preface to the Latin Works. The Gospel reveals the righteousness by which the righteous lives by faith, not a standard of wrath but a gift and a verdict. Righteousness became something alien to him, given in Christ, not achieved. His theological grammar shifted. He saw two kinds of righteousness. One, passive before God, received by faith. The other, active toward the neighbor, expressed in love. He saw two words of God. The law, which always accuses. The Gospel, which promises and gives Christ.

This shift became public through clashes over indulgences in 1517. The Ninety Five Theses questioned the efficacy of indulgences and the power of the keys in financial campaigns. The controversy drove Luther from abuses to roots. In the Heidelberg Disputation of 1518 he argued for a theology of the cross. The theologian of glory climbs by works and visible success. The theologian of the cross calls a thing what it is, sees God hidden in suffering and the word of the cross. That cruciform emphasis explains his account of justification. God justifies the ungodly through the foolishness of preaching. The sinner is declared righteous while still in fact a sinner. Simul iustus et peccator names this paradox under the cross.

Encounters with Roman authorities sharpened his articulation. In Augsburg in 1518 Cardinal Cajetan pressed him on faith and the treasury of merits. In 1519 at Leipzig Johann Eck challenged his positions and linked him with Jan Hus. The debate pushed Luther to rely more openly on Scripture as the norm. The year 1520 brought three programmatic treatises. The Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation called for reform of church structures and teaching. The Babylonian Captivity of the Church attacked sacramental bondage and reduced the sacraments to word and promise. The Freedom of a Christian expressed the heart of justification. A Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none. A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all. Faith receives Christ and his righteousness, and love flows outward toward the neighbor. In 1521 at the Diet of Worms he refused to recant. Conscience bound to the word of God, he would not. The doctrine of justification stood behind that conscience, since the word brings the verdict that frees.

Writings anchored his thought in exegesis. The Preface to Romans of 1522 explained righteousness and faith as trust, and set the tone for evangelical reading of Scripture. The Commentary on Galatians of 1535 returned to the conflict of promise and law. There he explained imputation, the exchange by which Christ takes our sin and gives us his righteousness. This alien righteousness is extra nos, outside us, yet granted to us. God justifies through a forensic act, a courtroom verdict grounded in Christ's obedience and cross. Faith is the instrument that receives the res, the thing given, which is Christ himself. Faith does not justify because it is virtuous. Faith justifies because it clings to Christ who is our righteousness.

Luther also clarified the settings of justification. Before God, coram Deo, humans have only passive righteousness. They are recipients of promise. Before the world, coram mundo, they exercise active righteousness. They love, they do works, they serve. This distinction protects the Gospel from being turned into a new law. It also protects the neighbor from spiritual escapism, since the justified are conscripted into the works of love. The law and Gospel distinction supplies the rhythm. The law exposes sin and drives to Christ. The Gospel gives forgiveness, life, and salvation. Salvation comes by grace alone, through faith alone, on account of Christ alone, proclaimed in the Word alone.

The turning point of the Reformation is not a single date, yet several moments crystallize it. The breakthrough in reading Romans, located by Luther in later memory, made God's righteousness a gift. The indulgence controversy in 1517 moved the issue from classroom to Christendom. The program of 1520 set evangelical soteriology in public. The stand at Worms in 1521 embedded doctrine in conscience and authority. Finally, confessional consolidation came with the Augsburg Confession in 1530, drafted by Melanchthon, whose Article 4 states that humans are justified freely for Christ's sake through faith, not by their own merits. The Apology of the Augsburg Confession in 1531 elaborated this claim against scholastic conceptions. In 1525 Luther also opposed Erasmus on free will. In The Bondage of the Will he argued that fallen will cannot cooperate in justification. God alone acts in making alive. Monergism protects sola gratia and grounds the certainty of promise.

Theologically, Luther's view reoriented the economy of salvation. Instead of a process centered on infused habits and cooperative merit, justification became a once for all verdict. Sanctification and love followed, necessary yet derivative. The sacraments were reinterpreted as visible words that deliver the promise. Baptism and the Supper are means through which the righteousness of Christ is given, not works that accumulate credit. Confession and absolution were retained but recast as the delivery of the verdict of forgiveness. Pastoral assurance is the payoff. If righteousness rests on Christ and is promised in the word, the believer may trust that he or she is righteous before God now.

Reception brought conflict and legacy. Roman theologians rejected imputation alone. At the Council of Trent, Session 6 in 1547, the decree on justification defined justification as both remission of sins and the sanctification and renewal of the inner man, and it anathematized the view that humans are justified by the imputation of the righteousness of Christ alone or by the remission of sins alone. The Lutheran churches continued to confess Article 4 as central and later summarized their position in the Formula of Concord in 1577. The Reformed traditions, in Calvin and others, shared the forensic account and imputation, though they arranged union with Christ and the ordo salutis differently. Modern historiography has debated whether Luther's account marks a decisive break with medieval models or an Augustinian retrieval sharpened by crisis. Heiko Oberman underscored Luther's late medieval roots. Alister McGrath highlighted the novelty of a purely forensic justification. A Finnish school has emphasized union with Christ in Luther's thought. Yet across these debates, the Reformation's center of gravity remains the alien righteousness of Christ received by faith.

In sum, Luther's doctrine of justification, born from Scripture and pastoral need, replaced a penitential ladder with a divine verdict, sent sinners to Christ alone, and set the course of Western Christianity for centuries.
