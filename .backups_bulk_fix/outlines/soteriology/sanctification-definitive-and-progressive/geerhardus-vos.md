# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos developed a robust understanding of **sanctification** within the framework of **redemptive history**, emphasizing both its **definitive** and **progressive** aspects. He distinguished the once-for-all act of being set apart in Christ from the ongoing, Spirit-empowered transformation of the believer, rooting both in union with Christ and the application of **eschatological realities**.

- "Sanctification is not a mere ethical process, but a supernatural work of God in the believer, grounded in the new creation." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5: Ecclesiology, The Means of Grace, Eschatology")

## Key Works

- "Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5: Ecclesiology, The Means of Grace, Eschatology"
- "The Pauline Eschatology"
- "Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments"
- "The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church"
- "The Kingdom of God and the Church"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is rooted in union with Christ**
    - Union with Christ is the foundation for both definitive and progressive sanctification.
    - The believer participates in Christ’s death and resurrection, which decisively breaks the power of sin.
    - Sanctification flows from the objective work of Christ applied by the Holy Spirit.
    - This union is both legal (justification) and transformative (sanctification).
    - "The believer’s sanctification is inseparable from his union with Christ." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5")

2. **Definitive sanctification as an eschatological act**
    - Definitive sanctification is a once-for-all act accomplished at conversion.
    - It marks the believer’s transition from the old age of sin to the new age in Christ.
    - This act is grounded in Christ’s resurrection and the inauguration of the new creation.
    - The believer is set apart, no longer under the dominion of sin.
    - "Definitive sanctification is the eschatological breach with the old world." ("The Pauline Eschatology")

3. **Progressive sanctification as Spirit-empowered transformation**
    - Progressive sanctification is the ongoing process of moral and spiritual renewal.
    - The Holy Spirit continually applies Christ’s benefits, conforming believers to His image.
    - This process involves active participation and growth in holiness.
    - It is characterized by the mortification of sin and vivification of new life.
    - "Sanctification is a process in which the Spirit works out in us what Christ has accomplished for us." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5")

4. **Sanctification is covenantal and corporate**
    - Sanctification is not merely individual but occurs within the context of the covenant community.
    - The means of grace, especially the Word and sacraments, are central to sanctification.
    - The church is the sphere where sanctification is nurtured and expressed.
    - Mutual exhortation and discipline are vital for corporate growth in holiness.
    - "The church is the sphere in which the sanctifying work of the Spirit is most clearly manifested." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5")

5. **Eschatological tension: already and not yet**
    - Sanctification reflects the tension between the inaugurated and consummated kingdom.
    - Believers possess definitive sanctification but await its full realization.
    - The struggle with sin continues until glorification, but victory is assured in Christ.
    - The eschatological perspective shapes both the hope and the pursuit of holiness.
    - "The Christian lives between the ages, sanctified in principle, striving toward the end." ("The Pauline Eschatology")

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **definitive and progressive sanctification** has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in its emphasis on union with Christ and eschatological fulfillment. His redemptive-historical approach provided a framework for understanding sanctification as both a decisive act and a Spirit-driven process. Later theologians, such as John Murray and Richard Gaffin, have built upon Vos’s insights, making his categories foundational for contemporary discussions of sanctification in the Reformed tradition.
