# Richard Gaffin (1936–)

Richard Gaffin’s understanding of the **nature and origin of sin** is deeply rooted in the **Reformed tradition**, emphasizing the historical reality of **Adam’s fall**, the **federal headship** of Adam, and the pervasive effects of **original sin** on all humanity. Gaffin maintains that sin is not merely a collection of acts but a profound corruption of human nature, inherited from Adam and only overcome through union with **Christ**.

- "The fall into sin is not a myth or a parable but a real event with real consequences for the entire human race." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology"
- "Adam, Christ, and Covenant" (in "Biblical Hermeneutics: Five Views")
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (in "The Pattern of Sound Doctrine: Systematic Theology at the Westminster Seminaries")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Adam and the Fall**
    - Affirms the historical existence of Adam as the first man and covenant head.
    - Views the fall as a real, space-time event with universal consequences.
    - Rejects mythological or purely symbolic readings of Genesis 3.
    - Sees the fall as foundational for understanding the need for redemption.
    - "The historicity of Adam and the fall is essential to the coherence of Paul’s gospel." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam acted as the federal representative of all humanity.
    - Adam’s sin is imputed to all his descendants, resulting in universal guilt and corruption.
    - Connects the imputation of Adam’s sin to the imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
    - Emphasizes the covenantal structure of redemptive history.
    - "As in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive—federal headship is at the heart of Paul’s soteriology." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

3. **Total Depravity and Corruption**
    - Sin affects every aspect of human nature: mind, will, and affections.
    - Humanity is not merely wounded but spiritually dead apart from grace.
    - No part of human life is untouched by the effects of the fall.
    - The pervasive corruption necessitates sovereign grace for salvation.
    - "Total depravity means that sin is not just an act but a condition that permeates our entire being." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

4. **Sin’s Origin in Human Disobedience**
    - Sin originated in Adam’s willful transgression of God’s command.
    - The origin of sin is not attributed to God but to the creature’s rebellion.
    - Maintains the goodness of creation and the responsibility of the creature.
    - The mystery of sin’s origin is acknowledged but not explained away.
    - "Sin’s origin is not in God but in the creature’s free and responsible act of disobedience." ("Adam, Christ, and Covenant")

5. **Redemption as Reversal of Sin’s Effects**
    - Christ’s work addresses both the guilt and power of sin.
    - Union with Christ is the means by which believers are delivered from Adamic condemnation.
    - The resurrection of Christ inaugurates the new creation, overcoming the effects of the fall.
    - Sanctification is the progressive undoing of sin’s corruption in the believer.
    - "Redemption in Christ is the reversal and surpassing of what was lost in Adam." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **nature and origin of sin** has reinforced the centrality of **federal theology** and the historical Adam within contemporary Reformed thought. His work has shaped discussions on **Pauline theology**, especially regarding the relationship between Adam and Christ, and has provided a robust defense of the traditional doctrine of original sin against modern challenges. Gaffin’s influence endures in both academic and ecclesiastical settings, particularly among those committed to confessional Reformed orthodoxy.
