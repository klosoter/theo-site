# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos defined the **nature and task of theology** as the disciplined study of **God’s self-revelation** in history, with a particular emphasis on the unfolding of **redemptive revelation**. He distinguished **biblical theology** from **systematic theology**, arguing that theology must be rooted in the progressive, organic development of **revelation** as recorded in Scripture.

- "Biblical Theology, rightly defined, is nothing else than the exhibition of the organic progress of supernatural revelation in its historic continuity and multiformity." ("Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments")

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline" (article)
- "The Nature and Aims of Biblical Theology" (article)
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Historical and Progressive**
    - Theology must trace the **unfolding of revelation** through redemptive history.
    - God’s self-disclosure is not static but develops organically from **Genesis to Revelation**.
    - The meaning of revelation is best understood in its historical context.
    - The unity of Scripture is seen in the progression of **covenantal revelation**.
    - "Revelation is not an isolated act, but a historical process." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Distinction Between Biblical and Systematic Theology**
    - **Biblical theology** focuses on the historical development of doctrine.
    - **Systematic theology** arranges doctrines according to logical and topical order.
    - Both disciplines are necessary, but their methods and aims differ.
    - Biblical theology serves as the foundation for systematic reflection.
    - "Biblical Theology deals with revelation as a divine activity, not as a human product." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Theology as a Science of God’s Self-Revelation**
    - Theology is a **science** because it seeks to understand God’s self-revelation in an orderly way.
    - The object of theology is not human religious experience, but God’s acts and words.
    - Theological study is grounded in the **objective reality** of revelation.
    - The task of theology is to interpret and articulate the content of revelation.
    - "Theology is concerned with the facts of revelation as given by God, not with their subjective impression." (Reformed Dogmatics)

4. **Organic Unity of Scripture**
    - Scripture possesses an **organic unity** that reflects the unity of God’s redemptive purpose.
    - The various parts of Scripture are interconnected and mutually interpretive.
    - The organic approach avoids artificial harmonization or fragmentation.
    - The unity of Scripture is Christocentric, culminating in the person and work of Christ.
    - "The principle of organic unity is indispensable for the right understanding of revelation." (Biblical Theology)

5. **The Eschatological Orientation of Theology**
    - All revelation and theology are oriented toward the **eschatological goal** of God’s kingdom.
    - The progress of revelation is teleological, moving toward fulfillment in Christ.
    - Eschatology is not merely an appendix but central to the structure of theology.
    - The **already/not yet** tension shapes the interpretation of redemptive history.
    - "Eschatology precedes soteriology in the order of revelation." (Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **biblical theology** as a distinct discipline profoundly shaped Reformed theological method in the twentieth century. His emphasis on the **organic, historical, and redemptive character of revelation** provided a framework for understanding Scripture as a unified, Christ-centered whole. Vos’s influence endures in the work of later theologians such as Herman Ridderbos, Richard Gaffin, and Edmund Clowney, and remains foundational for contemporary Reformed approaches to the **nature and task of theology**.
